### Artificial Intelligence

### 1. [POPE: Learning to Reason on Hard Problems via Privileged On-Policy Exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18779v1)

Authors: Yuxiao Qu, Amrith Setlur, Virginia Smith, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Aviral Kumar

Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet state-of-the-art methods still fail to learn on many training problems. On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks.

### 2. [SeNeDiF-OOD: Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion for Out-of-Distribution Detection Methodology in Open-World Classification. A Case Study on Monument Style Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18739v1)

Authors: Ignacio Antequera-Sánchez, Juan Luis Suárez-Díaz, Rosana Montes, Francisco Herrera

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a fundamental requirement for the reliable deployment of artificial intelligence applications in open-world environments. However, addressing the heterogeneous nature of OOD data, ranging from low-level corruption to semantic shifts, remains a complex challenge that single-stage detectors often fail to resolve. To address this issue, we propose SeNeDiF-OOD, a novel methodology based on Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion. This framework decomposes the detection task into a hierarchical structure of binary fusion nodes, where each layer is designed to integrate decision boundaries aligned with specific levels of semantic abstraction. To validate the proposed framework, we present a comprehensive case study using MonuMAI, a real-world architectural style recognition system exposed to an open environment. This application faces a diverse range of inputs, including non-monument images, unknown architectural styles, and adversarial attacks, making it an ideal testbed for our proposal. Through extensive experimental evaluation in this domain, results demonstrate that our hierarchical fusion methodology significantly outperforms traditional baselines, effectively filtering these diverse OOD categories while preserving in-distribution performance.

### 3. [HalluCitation Matters: Revealing the Impact of Hallucinated References with 300 Hallucinated Papers in ACL Conferences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18724v1)

Authors: Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe

Recently, we have often observed hallucinated citations or references that do not correspond to any existing work in papers under review, preprints, or published papers. Such hallucinated citations pose a serious concern to scientific reliability. When they appear in accepted papers, they may also negatively affect the credibility of conferences. In this study, we refer to hallucinated citations as "HalluCitation" and systematically investigate their prevalence and impact. We analyze all papers published at ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP in 2024 and 2025, including main conference, Findings, and workshop papers. Our analysis reveals that nearly 300 papers contain at least one HalluCitation, most of which were published in 2025. Notably, half of these papers were identified at EMNLP 2025, the most recent conference, indicating that this issue is rapidly increasing. Moreover, more than 100 such papers were accepted as main conference and Findings papers at EMNLP 2025, affecting the credibility.

### 4. [Low Cost, High Efficiency: LiDAR Place Recognition in Vineyards with Matryoshka Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18714v1)

Authors: Judith Vilella-Cantos, Mauro Martini, Marcello Chiaberge, Mónica Ballesta, David Valiente

Localization in agricultural environments is challenging due to their unstructured nature and lack of distinctive landmarks. Although agricultural settings have been studied in the context of object classification and segmentation, the place recognition task for mobile robots is not trivial in the current state of the art. In this study, we propose MinkUNeXt-VINE, a lightweight, deep-learning-based method that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in vineyard environments thanks to its pre-processing and Matryoshka Representation Learning multi-loss approach. Our method prioritizes enhanced performance with low-cost, sparse LiDAR inputs and lower-dimensionality outputs to ensure high efficiency in real-time scenarios. Additionally, we present a comprehensive ablation study of the results on various evaluation cases and two extensive long-term vineyard datasets employing different LiDAR sensors. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the trade-off output produced by this approach, as well as its robust performance on low-cost and low-resolution input data. The code is publicly available for reproduction.

### 5. [Rank-1 Approximation of Inverse Fisher for Natural Policy Gradients in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18626v1)

Authors: Yingxiao Huo, Satya Prakash Dash, Radu Stoican, Samuel Kaski, Mingfei Sun

Natural gradients have long been studied in deep reinforcement learning due to their fast convergence properties and covariant weight updates. However, computing natural gradients requires inversion of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) at each iteration, which is computationally prohibitive in nature. In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable natural policy optimization technique that leverages a rank-1 approximation to full inverse-FIM. We theoretically show that under certain conditions, a rank-1 approximation to inverse-FIM converges faster than policy gradients and, under some conditions, enjoys the same sample complexity as stochastic policy gradient methods. We benchmark our method on a diverse set of environments and show that it achieves superior performance to standard actor-critic and trust-region baselines.

### 6. [Deconstructing Instruction-Following: A New Benchmark for Granular Evaluation of Large Language Model Instruction Compliance Abilities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18554v1)

Authors: Alberto Purpura, Li Wang, Sahil Badyal, Eugenio Beaufrand, Adam Faulkner

Reliably ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) follow complex instructions is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks often fail to reflect real-world use or isolate compliance from task success. We introduce MOSAIC (MOdular Synthetic Assessment of Instruction Compliance), a modular framework that uses a dynamically generated dataset with up to 20 application-oriented generation constraints to enable a granular and independent analysis of this capability. Our evaluation of five LLMs from different families based on this new benchmark demonstrates that compliance is not a monolithic capability but varies significantly with constraint type, quantity, and position. The analysis reveals model-specific weaknesses, uncovers synergistic and conflicting interactions between instructions, and identifies distinct positional biases such as primacy and recency effects. These granular insights are critical for diagnosing model failures and developing more reliable LLMs for systems that demand strict adherence to complex instructions.

### 7. [What Do Learned Models Measure?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18278v1)

Authors: Indrė Žliobaitė

In many scientific and data-driven applications, machine learning models are increasingly used as measurement instruments, rather than merely as predictors of predefined labels. When the measurement function is learned from data, the mapping from observations to quantities is determined implicitly by the training distribution and inductive biases, allowing multiple inequivalent mappings to satisfy standard predictive evaluation criteria. We formalize learned measurement functions as a distinct focus of evaluation and introduce measurement stability, a property capturing invariance of the measured quantity across admissible realizations of the learning process and across contexts. We show that standard evaluation criteria in machine learning, including generalization error, calibration, and robustness, do not guarantee measurement stability. Through a real-world case study, we show that models with comparable predictive performance can implement systematically inequivalent measurement functions, with distribution shift providing a concrete illustration of this failure. Taken together, our results highlight a limitation of existing evaluation frameworks in settings where learned model outputs are identified as measurements, motivating the need for an additional evaluative dimension.

### 8. [Beyond Retention: Orchestrating Structural Safety and Plasticity in Continual Learning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18255v1)

Authors: Fei Meng

Continual learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) faces the critical challenge of balancing stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (learning new tasks). While Experience Replay (ER) is a standard countermeasure against catastrophic forgetting, its impact across diverse capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we uncover a critical dichotomy in ER's behavior: while it induces positive backward transfer on robust, unstructured tasks (e.g., boosting performance on previous NLP classification tasks through repeated rehearsal), it causes severe negative transfer on fragile, structured domains like code generation (e.g., a significant relative drop in coding accuracy). This reveals that ER trades structural integrity for broad consolidation. To address this dilemma, we propose \textbf{Orthogonal Subspace Wake-up (OSW)}. OSW identifies essential parameter subspaces of previous tasks via a brief "wake-up" phase and enforces orthogonal updates for new tasks, providing a mathematically grounded "safety guarantee" for established knowledge structures. Empirical results across a diverse four-task sequence demonstrate that OSW uniquely succeeds in preserving fragile coding abilities where Replay fails, while simultaneously maintaining high plasticity for novel tasks. Our findings emphasize the necessity of evaluating structural safety alongside average retention in LLM continual learning.

### 9. [Co-PLNet: A Collaborative Point-Line Network for Prompt-Guided Wireframe Parsing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18252v1)

Authors: Chao Wang, Xuanying Li, Cheng Dai, Jinglei Feng, Yuxiang Luo, Yuqi Ouyang, Hao Qin

Wireframe parsing aims to recover line segments and their junctions to form a structured geometric representation useful for downstream tasks such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Existing methods predict lines and junctions separately and reconcile them post-hoc, causing mismatches and reduced robustness. We present Co-PLNet, a point-line collaborative framework that exchanges spatial cues between the two tasks, where early detections are converted into spatial prompts via a Point-Line Prompt Encoder (PLP-Encoder), which encodes geometric attributes into compact and spatially aligned maps. A Cross-Guidance Line Decoder (CGL-Decoder) then refines predictions with sparse attention conditioned on complementary prompts, enforcing point-line consistency and efficiency. Experiments on Wireframe and YorkUrban show consistent improvements in accuracy and robustness, together with favorable real-time efficiency, demonstrating our effectiveness for structured geometry perception.

### 10. [HeterCSI: Channel-Adaptive Heterogeneous CSI Pretraining Framework for Generalized Wireless Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18200v1)

Authors: Chenyu Zhang, Xinchen Lyu, Chenshan Ren, Shuhan Liu, Qimei Cui, Xiaofeng Tao

Wireless foundation models promise transformative capabilities for channel state information (CSI) processing across diverse 6G network applications, yet face fundamental challenges due to the inherent dual heterogeneity of CSI across both scale and scenario dimensions. However, current pretraining approaches either constrain inputs to fixed dimensions or isolate training by scale, limiting the generalization and scalability of wireless foundation models. In this paper, we propose HeterCSI, a channel-adaptive pretraining framework that reconciles training efficiency with robust cross-scenario generalization via a new understanding of gradient dynamics in heterogeneous CSI pretraining. Our key insight reveals that CSI scale heterogeneity primarily causes destructive gradient interference, while scenario diversity actually promotes constructive gradient alignment when properly managed. Specifically, we formulate heterogeneous CSI batch construction as a partitioning optimization problem that minimizes zero-padding overhead while preserving scenario diversity. To solve this, we develop a scale-aware adaptive batching strategy that aligns CSI samples of similar scales, and design a double-masking mechanism to isolate valid signals from padding artifacts. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that HeterCSI establishes a generalized foundation model without scenario-specific finetuning, achieving superior average performance over full-shot baselines. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot benchmark WiFo, it reduces NMSE by 7.19 dB, 4.08 dB, and 5.27 dB for CSI reconstruction, time-domain, and frequency-domain prediction, respectively. The proposed HeterCSI framework also reduces training latency by 53% compared to existing approaches while improving generalization performance by 1.53 dB on average.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [Lifecycle Cost-Effectiveness Modeling for Redundancy-Enhanced Multi-Chiplet Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18159v1)

Authors: Zizhen Liu, Fangzhiyi Wang, Mengdi Wang, Jing Ye, Hayden Kwok-Hay So, Cheng Liu, Huawei Li

The growing demand for compute-intensive applications has made multi-chiplet architectures a promising alternative to monolithic designs, offering improved scalability and manufacturing flexibility. However, effectively managing the economic effectiveness remains challenging. Existing cost models either overlook the amortization of compute value over a chip's operational lifetime or fail to evaluate how redundancy strategies, which are widely adopted to enhance yield and fault tolerance, impact long-term cost efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive cost-effectiveness framework for multi-chiplet architectures, introducing a novel Lifecycle Cost Effectiveness (LCE) metric that evaluates amortized compute costs by jointly optimizing manufacturing expenses and operational lifetime. Our approach uniquely integrates: (1) redundancy-aware cost modeling spanning both intra- and inter-chiplet levels, (2) reliability-driven lifetime estimation, and (3) quantitative analysis of how redundancy configurations on overall economic effectiveness. Extensive trade-off and multi-objective optimization studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and reveal essential co-optimization strategies between module and chiplet-level redundancy to achieve cost-efficient multi-chiplet architecture designs.

### 2. [CIM-Tuner: Balancing the Compute and Storage Capacity of SRAM-CIM Accelerator via Hardware-mapping Co-exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18070v1)

Authors: Jinwu Chen, Yuhui Shi, He Wang, Zhe Jiang, Jun Yang, Xin Si, Zhenhua Zhu

As an emerging type of AI computing accelerator, SRAM Computing-In-Memory (CIM) accelerators feature high energy efficiency and throughput. However, various CIM designs and under-explored mapping strategies impede the full exploration of compute and storage balancing in SRAM-CIM accelerator, potentially leading to significant performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose CIM-Tuner, an automatic tool for hardware balancing and optimal mapping strategy under area constraint via hardware-mapping co-exploration. It ensures universality across various CIM designs through a matrix abstraction of CIM macros and a generalized accelerator template. For efficient mapping with different hardware configurations, it employs fine-grained two-level strategies comprising accelerator-level scheduling and macro-level tiling. Compared to prior CIM mapping, CIM-Tuner's extended strategy space achieves 1.58$\times$ higher energy efficiency and 2.11$\times$ higher throughput. Applied to SOTA CIM accelerators with identical area budget, CIM-Tuner also delivers comparable improvements. The simulation accuracy is silicon-verified and CIM-Tuner tool is open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/CIM-Tuner.git.

### 3. [From Fuzzy to Exact: The Halo Architecture for Infinite-Depth Reasoning via Rational Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18702v1)

Authors: Hansheng Ren

Current paradigms in Deep Learning prioritize computational throughput over numerical precision, relying on the assumption that intelligence emerges from statistical correlation at scale. In this paper, we challenge this orthodoxy. We propose the Exactness Hypothesis: that General Intelligence (AGI), specifically high-order causal inference, requires a computational substrate capable of Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic. We argue that the "hallucinations" and logical incoherence seen in current Large Language Models (LLMs) are artifacts of IEEE 754 floating-point approximation errors accumulating over deep compositional functions. To mitigate this, we introduce the Halo Architecture, a paradigm shift to Rational Arithmetic ($\mathbb{Q}$) supported by a novel Exact Inference Unit (EIU). Empirical validation on the Huginn-0125 prototype demonstrates that while 600B-parameter scale BF16 baselines collapse in chaotic systems, Halo maintains zero numerical divergence indefinitely. This work establishes exact arithmetic as a prerequisite for reducing logical uncertainty in System 2 AGI.

### 4. [RTeAAL Sim: Using Tensor Algebra to Represent and Accelerate RTL Simulation (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18140v1)

Authors: Yan Zhu, Boru Chen, Christopher W. Fletcher, Nandeeka Nayak

RTL simulation on CPUs remains a persistent bottleneck in hardware design. State-of-the-art simulators embed the circuit directly into the simulation binary, resulting in long compilation times and execution that is fundamentally CPU frontend-bound, with severe instruction-cache pressure.
  This work proposes RTeAAL Sim, which reformulates RTL simulation as a sparse tensor algebra problem. By representing RTL circuits as tensors and simulation as a sparse tensor algebra kernel, RTeAAL Sim decouples simulation behavior from binary size and makes RTL simulation amenable to well-studied tensor algebra optimizations. We demonstrate that a prototype of our tensor-based simulator, even with a subset of these optimizations, already mitigates the compilation overhead and frontend pressure and achieves performance competitive with the highly optimized Verilator simulator across multiple CPUs and ISAs.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [Properties of calculus in r-Complexity 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18437v1)

Authors: Rares Folea, Emil Slusanschi

This paper presents a series of general properties of the r-Complexity calculus, a complexity measurement for assessing the performance and asymptotic behaviour of real-world algorithms. This research describes characteristics such as reflexivity, transitivity, or symmetry and discusses several conversion rules between different classes of r-Complexity, as well as establishing fundamental arithmetic principles. The work also examines the behaviour of the addition property within this system and compares its characteristics with those frequently used in the traditional Bachmann-Landau notation. Through utilizing these properties, this research seeks to promote the exploration and development of novel applications for r-Complexity, as well as accelerating the adoption rate of calculus in this refined complexity model.

### 2. [AgentDoG: A Diagnostic Guardrail Framework for AI Agent Safety and Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18491v1)

Authors: Dongrui Liu, Qihan Ren, Chen Qian, Shuai Shao, Yuejin Xie, Yu Li, Zhonghao Yang, Haoyu Luo, Peng Wang, Qingyu Liu, Binxin Hu, Ling Tang, Jilin Mei, Dadi Guo, Leitao Yuan, Junyao Yang, Guanxu Chen, Qihao Lin, Yi Yu, Bo Zhang, Jiaxuan Guo, Jie Zhang, Wenqi Shao, Huiqi Deng, Zhiheng Xi, Wenjie Wang, Wenxuan Wang, Wen Shen, Zhikai Chen, Haoyu Xie, Jialing Tao, Juntao Dai, Jiaming Ji, Zhongjie Ba, Linfeng Zhang, Yong Liu, Quanshi Zhang, Lei Zhu, Zhihua Wei, Hui Xue, Chaochao Lu, Jing Shao, Xia Hu

The rise of AI agents introduces complex safety and security challenges arising from autonomous tool use and environmental interactions. Current guardrail models lack agentic risk awareness and transparency in risk diagnosis. To introduce an agentic guardrail that covers complex and numerous risky behaviors, we first propose a unified three-dimensional taxonomy that orthogonally categorizes agentic risks by their source (where), failure mode (how), and consequence (what). Guided by this structured and hierarchical taxonomy, we introduce a new fine-grained agentic safety benchmark (ATBench) and a Diagnostic Guardrail framework for agent safety and security (AgentDoG). AgentDoG provides fine-grained and contextual monitoring across agent trajectories. More Crucially, AgentDoG can diagnose the root causes of unsafe actions and seemingly safe but unreasonable actions, offering provenance and transparency beyond binary labels to facilitate effective agent alignment. AgentDoG variants are available in three sizes (4B, 7B, and 8B parameters) across Qwen and Llama model families. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AgentDoG achieves state-of-the-art performance in agentic safety moderation in diverse and complex interactive scenarios. All models and datasets are openly released.

### 3. [Capturing P: On the Expressive Power and Efficient Evaluation of Boolean Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18747v1)

Authors: Amir Aavani

Modern information retrieval is transitioning from simple document filtering to complex, neuro-symbolic reasoning workflows. However, current retrieval architectures face a fundamental efficiency dilemma when handling the rigorous logical and arithmetic constraints required by this new paradigm. Standard iterator-based engines (Document-at-a-Time) do not natively support complex, nested logic graphs; forcing them to execute such queries typically results in intractable runtime performance. Conversely, naive recursive approaches (Term-at-a-Time), while capable of supporting these structures, suffer from prohibitive memory consumption when enforcing broad logical exclusions.
  In this paper, we propose that a retrieval engine must be capable of ``Capturing $\mathbf{P}$'' -- evaluating any polynomial-time property directly over its index in a computationally efficient manner. We define a formal Retrieval Language ($\mathcal{L}_R$) based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and prove it precisely captures the complexity class $\mathbf{P}$. We introduce \texttt{ComputePN}, a novel evaluation algorithm that makes $\mathcal{L}_R$ tractable. By combining native DAG traversal with a memory-efficient ``Positive-Negative'' response mechanism, \texttt{ComputePN} ensures the efficient evaluation of any query in $\mathcal{L}_R$. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for turning the search index into a general-purpose computational engine.

### Computational Engineering

### 1. [Gradient-Informed Machine Learning in Electromagnetics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18300v1)

Authors: Matteo Zorzetto, Merle Backmeyer, Michael Wiesheu, Riccardo Torchio, Fabrizio Dughiero, Sebastian Schöps

Simulation techniques such as the finite element method are essential for designing electrical devices, but their computational cost can be prohibitive for repeated or real-time computations. Projection-based model order reduction techniques mitigate this by reducing the model size and complexity, yet face challenges when extended to nonlinear or non-affine parametric models. In this work, Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is combined with proper orthogonal decomposition and Gaussian process regression to construct a non-intrusive surrogate model of a parametric nonlinear model of a permanent magnet synchronous machine. The differentiable nature of IGA allows for computationally efficient extraction of parametric sensitivities, which are leveraged for gradient-enhanced surrogate modeling.

### 2. [Regulatory Hub Discovery in MDD Methylome: Hypotheses for Molecular Subtypes via Computational Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18498v1)

Authors: Mingyan Liu, Min Huang

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a clinically heterogeneous syndrome with diverse etiological pathways. Traditional Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) have successfully identified risk loci based on differential methylation magnitude. As a complementary perspective, effect-size-based ranking alone may not fully capture regulatory nodes that exhibit modest methylation changes but occupy critical upstream positions in biological networks. Here, we report findings and hypotheses from a two-tier computational analysis of DNA methylation data (GSE198904; \(n=206\) ), combining conventional statistical approaches with machine learning-assisted regulatory inference.

### 3. [Uncertainty Quantification in Calibration and Simulation of Thermo-Chemical Curing of Epoxy Resins](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18359v1)

Authors: Jendrik-Alexander Tröger, Christina Steinweller, Stefan Hartmann

Curing of epoxy resins poses a particular challenge in terms of modeling, experimental investigation, and numerical implementation, as it is a thermo-chemo-mechanical process. Several constitutive relations are required to model these processes, yielding numerous material parameters. The calibration of the constitutive relations must be performed using multiple steps, wherein uncertainties unavoidably propagate. In this study, we investigate the propagation of uncertainties during both the multi-step calibration procedure and the numerical simulation of curing processes with the identified parameters. For both, we employ the first-order second-moment method, which is carefully evaluated through coverage tests and by comparing it to the Monte Carlo method as a reference. It is demonstrated that the first-order second-moment method efficiently yields reasonable results, although providing only a first-order approximation of the highly nonlinear stochastic model response.

### Computation and Language

### 1. [POPE: Learning to Reason on Hard Problems via Privileged On-Policy Exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18779v1)

Authors: Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe

Recently, we have often observed hallucinated citations or references that do not correspond to any existing work in papers under review, preprints, or published papers. Such hallucinated citations pose a serious concern to scientific reliability. When they appear in accepted papers, they may also negatively affect the credibility of conferences. In this study, we refer to hallucinated citations as "HalluCitation" and systematically investigate their prevalence and impact.

### 3. [Fine-Grained Emotion Detection on GoEmotions: Experimental Comparison of Classical Machine Learning, BiLSTM, and Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18162v1)

Authors: Ani Harutyunyan, Sachin Kumar

Fine-grained emotion recognition is a challenging multi-label NLP task due to label overlap and class imbalance. In this work, we benchmark three modeling families on the GoEmotions dataset: a TF-IDF-based logistic regression system trained with binary relevance, a BiLSTM with attention, and a BERT model fine-tuned for multi-label classification. Experiments follow the official train/validation/test split, and imbalance is mitigated using inverse-frequency class weights. Across several metrics, namely Micro-F1, Macro-F1, Hamming Loss, and Subset Accuracy, we observe that logistic regression attains the highest Micro-F1 of 0.51, while BERT achieves the best overall balance surpassing the official paper's reported results, reaching Macro-F1 0.49, Hamming Loss 0.036, and Subset Accuracy 0.36. This suggests that frequent emotions often rely on surface lexical cues, whereas contextual representations improve performance on rarer emotions and more ambiguous examples.

### 4. [FP8-RL: A Practical and Stable Low-Precision Stack for LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18150v1)

Authors: Zhaopeng Qiu, Shuang Yu, Jingqi Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Xue Huang, Jingyi Yang, Junjie Lai

Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly bottlenecked by rollout (generation), where long output sequence lengths make attention and KV-cache memory dominate end-to-end step time. FP8 offers an attractive lever for accelerating RL by reducing compute cost and memory traffic during rollout, but applying FP8 in RL introduces unique engineering and algorithmic challenges: policy weights change every step (requiring repeated quantization and weight synchronization into the inference engine) and low-precision rollouts can deviate from the higher-precision policy assumed by the trainer, causing train-inference mismatch and potential instability. This report presents a practical FP8 rollout stack for LLM RL, implemented in the veRL ecosystem with support for common training backends (e.g., FSDP/Megatron-LM) and inference engines (e.g., vLLM/SGLang). We (i) enable FP8 W8A8 linear-layer rollout using blockwise FP8 quantization, (ii) extend FP8 to KV-cache to remove long-context memory bottlenecks via per-step QKV scale recalibration, and (iii) mitigate mismatch using importance-sampling-based rollout correction (token-level TIS/MIS variants). Across dense and MoE models, these techniques deliver up to 44% rollout throughput gains while preserving learning behavior comparable to BF16 baselines.

### 5. [Typhoon-S: Minimal Open Post-Training for Sovereign Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18129v1)

Authors: Kunat Pipatanakul, Pittawat Taveekitworachai

Large language models (LLMs) have progressed rapidly; however, most state-of-the-art models are trained and evaluated primarily in high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, and are often developed by a small number of organizations with access to large-scale compute and data. This gatekeeping creates a practical barrier for sovereign settings in which a regional- or national-scale institution or domain owner must retain control and understanding of model weights, training data, and deployment while operating under limited resources and strict transparency constraints. To this end, we identify two core requirements: (1) adoptability, the ability to transform a base model into a general-purpose assistant, and (2) sovereign capability, the ability to perform high-stakes, region-specific tasks (e.g., legal reasoning in local languages and cultural knowledge). We investigate whether these requirements can be achieved without scaling massive instruction corpora or relying on complex preference tuning pipelines and large-scale reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We present Typhoon S, a minimal and open post-training recipe that combines supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and small-scale RFT. Using Thai as a representative case study, we demonstrate that our approach transforms both sovereign-adapted and general-purpose base models into instruction-tuned models with strong general performance. We further show that small-scale RFT with InK-GRPO -- an extension of GRPO that augments the GRPO loss with a next-word prediction loss -- improves Thai legal reasoning and Thai-specific knowledge while preserving general capabilities. Our results suggest that a carefully designed post-training strategy can reduce the required scale of instruction data and computation, providing a practical path toward high-quality sovereign LLMs under academic-scale resources.

### 6. [Do not be greedy, Think Twice: Sampling and Selection for Document-level Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18395v1)

Authors: Mikel Zubillaga, Oscar Sainz, Oier Lopez de Lacalle, Eneko Agirre

Document-level Information Extraction (DocIE) aims to produce an output template with the entities and relations of interest occurring in the given document. Standard practices include prompting decoder-only LLMs using greedy decoding to avoid output variability. Rather than treating this variability as a limitation, we show that sampling can produce substantially better solutions than greedy decoding, especially when using reasoning models. We thus propose ThinkTwice, a sampling and selection framework in which the LLM generates multiple candidate templates for a given document, and a selection module chooses the most suitable one. We introduce both an unsupervised method that exploits agreement across generated outputs, and a supervised selection method using reward models trained on labeled DocIE data. To address the scarcity of golden reasoning trajectories for DocIE, we propose a rejection-sampling-based method to generate silver training data that pairs output templates with reasoning traces. Our experiments show the validity of unsupervised and supervised ThinkTwice, consistently outperforming greedy baselines and the state-of-the-art.

### 7. [Code over Words: Overcoming Semantic Inertia via Code-Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18352v1)

Authors: Manjie Xu, Isabella Yin, Xinyi Tu, Chi Zhang, Yixin Zhu

LLMs struggle with Semantic Inertia: the inability to inhibit pre-trained priors (e.g., "Lava is Dangerous") when dynamic, in-context rules contradict them. We probe this phenomenon using Baba Is You, where physical laws are mutable text rules, enabling precise evaluation of models' ability to override learned priors when rules change. We quantatively observe that larger models can exhibit inverse scaling: they perform worse than smaller models when natural language reasoning requires suppressing pre-trained associations (e.g., accepting "Lava is Safe"). Our analysis attributes this to natural language encoding, which entangles descriptive semantics and logical rules, leading to persistent hallucinations of familiar physics despite explicit contradictory rules. Here we show that representing dynamics as executable code, rather than descriptive text, reverses this trend and enables effective prior inhibition. We introduce Code-Grounded Vistas (LCV), which fine-tunes models on counterfactual pairs and identifies states with contradictory rules, thereby forcing attention to logical constraints rather than visual semantics. This training-time approach outperforms expensive inference-time search methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that representation fundamentally determines whether scaling improves or impairs contextual reasoning. This challenges the assumption that larger models are universally better, with implications for domains that require dynamic overriding of learned priors.

Authors: Clément Christophe, Wadood Mohammed Abdul, Prateek Munjal, Tathagata Raha, Ronnie Rajan, Praveenkumar Kanithi

As LLMs are increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, their tendency for sycophancy, prioritizing user agreement over factual accuracy, poses significant risks to patient safety. While existing evaluations often rely on subjective datasets, we introduce a robust framework grounded in medical MCQA with verifiable ground truths. We propose the Adjusted Sycophancy Score, a novel metric that isolates alignment bias by accounting for stochastic model instability, or "confusability". Through an extensive scaling analysis of the Qwen-3 and Llama-3 families, we identify a clear scaling trajectory for resilience. Furthermore, we reveal a counter-intuitive vulnerability in reasoning-optimized "Thinking" models: while they demonstrate high vanilla accuracy, their internal reasoning traces frequently rationalize incorrect user suggestions under authoritative pressure. Our results across frontier models suggest that benchmark performance is not a proxy for clinical reliability, and that simplified reasoning structures may offer superior robustness against expert-driven sycophancy.

### 9. [Unknown Unknowns: Why Hidden Intentions in LLMs Evade Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18552v1)

Authors: Devansh Srivastav, David Pape, Lea Schönherr

LLMs are increasingly embedded in everyday decision-making, yet their outputs can encode subtle, unintended behaviours that shape user beliefs and actions. We refer to these covert, goal-directed behaviours as hidden intentions, which may arise from training and optimisation artefacts, or be deliberately induced by an adversarial developer, yet remain difficult to detect in practice. We introduce a taxonomy of ten categories of hidden intentions, grounded in social science research and organised by intent, mechanism, context, and impact, shifting attention from surface-level behaviours to design-level strategies of influence. We show how hidden intentions can be easily induced in controlled models, providing both testbeds for evaluation and demonstrations of potential misuse. We systematically assess detection methods, including reasoning and non-reasoning LLM judges, and find that detection collapses in realistic open-world settings, particularly under low-prevalence conditions, where false positives overwhelm precision and false negatives conceal true risks. Stress tests on precision-prevalence and precision-FNR trade-offs reveal why auditing fails without vanishingly small false positive rates or strong priors on manipulation types. Finally, a qualitative case study shows that all ten categories manifest in deployed, state-of-the-art LLMs, emphasising the urgent need for robust frameworks. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of detectability failures of hidden intentions in LLMs under open-world settings, offering a foundation for understanding, inducing, and stress-testing such behaviours, and establishing a flexible taxonomy for anticipating evolving threats and informing governance.

### 10. [One Persona, Many Cues, Different Results: How Sociodemographic Cues Impact LLM Personalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18572v1)

Authors: Franziska Weeber, Vera Neplenbroek, Jan Batzner, Sebastian Padó

Personalization of LLMs by sociodemographic subgroup often improves user experience, but can also introduce or amplify biases and unfair outcomes across groups. Prior work has employed so-called personas, sociodemographic user attributes conveyed to a model, to study bias in LLMs by relying on a single cue to prompt a persona, such as user names or explicit attribute mentions. This disregards LLM sensitivity to prompt variations (robustness) and the rarity of some cues in real interactions (external validity). We compare six commonly used persona cues across seven open and proprietary LLMs on four writing and advice tasks. While cues are overall highly correlated, they produce substantial variance in responses across personas. We therefore caution against claims from a single persona cue and recommend future personalization research to evaluate multiple externally valid cues.

Authors: Mickaël Montessinos

We show reductions and equivalences between various problems related to the computation of the endomorphism ring of principally polarised superspecial abelian surfaces. Problems considered are the computation of the Ibukiyama-Katsura-Oort matrix and computation of unpolarised isomoprhisms between superspecial abelian surfaces.

### 2. [Scaling up Privacy-Preserving ML: A CKKS Implementation of Llama-2-7B](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18511v1)

Authors: Jaiyoung Park, Sejin Park, Jai Hyun Park, Jung Ho Ahn, Jung Hee Cheon, Guillaume Hanrot, Jung Woo Kim, Minje Park, Damien Stehlé

As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, privacy concerns pertaining to inference inputs keep growing. In this context, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) has emerged as a primary cryptographic solution to provide non-interactive confidential LLM inference. Existing solutions scale poorly with the input token length, and hence focus either on small models or larger models with a small number of input tokens. They also suffer from the existence of large outlier values. These values have a strong impact on the evaluation of non-linear layers, leading to large-degree polynomial approximation and thus heavy evaluation costs.
  We propose an FHE-based private LLM inference solution that allows thousands of input tokens with only a part of them being encrypted: this fits with a scenario where the context is benign and only part of the input is sensitive. To do so, we suggest an unbalanced chunked prefill framework that processes the private and public parts of the input tokens differently. Our framework contains plaintext-plaintext, plaintext-ciphertext and ciphertext-ciphertext computational components. We adopt different strategies and ingredients for each component. We also devise new homomorphic algorithms for specific matrix multiplication and polynomial evaluation tasks encountered during LLM inference.
  Furthermore, without retraining, we tailor the LLM inference algorithm to reduce the ranges of outlier values: we leverage machine learning strategies (token prepending and rotations) to mitigate the impact of the outliers on non-linear layers.
  Based on these ingredients, we describe a CKKS-based end-to-end implementation of Llama-2-7B private inference for up to 4096 input tokens, of which the last 128 are encrypted. On a cluster of 8~NVIDIA RTX-4090 GPUs, inference takes 85s for summarization and 33s for generation per output token.

### 3. [$α^3$-SecBench: A Large-Scale Evaluation Suite of Security, Resilience, and Trust for LLM-based UAV Agents over 6G Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18754v1)

Authors: Mohamed Amine Ferrag, Abderrahmane Lakas, Merouane Debbah

Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical, networked environments where they must operate reliably in the presence of malicious adversaries. While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings.
  We introduce $α^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $α^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $α^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage).
  We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making. We release $α^{3}$-SecBench on GitHub: https://github.com/maferrag/AlphaSecBench

### 4. [KeyMemRT Compiler and Runtime: Unlocking Memory-Scalable FHE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18445v1)

Authors: Eymen Ünay, Björn Franke, Jackson Woodruff

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables privacy preserving computation but it suffers from high latency and memory consumption. The computations are secured with special keys called rotation keys which often take up the majority of memory. In complex FHE applications, these rotation keys can cause a large memory bottleneck limiting program throughput. Existing compilers make little effort to solve this problem, instead relying on systems with massive memory availability. This resource requirement is a barrier to FHE uptake because optimizing FHE programs by hand is challenging due to their scale, complexity and expertise required.
  In this work, we present KeyMemRT; an MLIR based compiler and runtime framework that individually manages rotation key lifetimes to lower memory utilization and to allow arbitrary number of rotation indices to be supported without memory bloating. KeyMemRT relies on dataflow analysis to determine key lifetimes and is the first FHE compiler to provide automatic key management, handle fine-grained key-mangement and manage boostrap keys. We implement frontends for Orion and HEIR and show improvements over state-of-the-art FHE compilers. KeyMemRT achieves memory reduction of 1.74x and a speedup of 1.20x over ANT-ACE, and memory reduction of 1.16x and a speedup of 1.73x over memory-optimized compiler Fhelipe. We provide KeyMemRT as a post-optimizing compiler that can be targeted by any FHE compiler.

Authors: Darlan Noetzold, Valderi Reis Quietinho Leithardt

This book arises from the need to provide a clear and up-to-date overview of the impacts of quantum computing on cryptography. The goal is to provide a reference in Portuguese for undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students in the field of data security and cryptography. Throughout the chapters, we present fundamentals, we discuss classical and post-quantum algorithms, evaluate emerging patterns, and point out real-world implementation challenges. The initial objective is to serve as a guide for students, researchers, and professionals who need to understand not only the mathematics involved, but also its practical implications in security systems and policies. For more advanced professionals, the main objective is to present content and ideas so that they can assess the changes and perspectives in the era of quantum cryptographic algorithms. To that end, the text's structure was designed to be progressive: we begin with essential concepts, move on to quantum algorithms and their consequences (with emphasis on Shor's algorithm), present issues focusing on "families" of post-quantum schemes (based on lattices, codes, hash functions, multivariate, isogenies), analyze the state of the art in standardization (highlighting the NIST process), and finally, discuss migration, interoperability, performance, and cryptographic governance. We hope that this work will assist in the formation of critical thinking and informed technical decision-making, fostering secure transition strategies for the post-quantum era.

### 6. [Rhea: Detecting Privilege-Escalated Evasive Ransomware Attacks Using Format-Aware Validation in the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18216v1)

Authors: Beom Heyn Kim, Seok Min Hong, Mohammad Mannan

Ransomware variants increasingly combine privilege escalation with sophisticated evasion strategies such as intermittent encryption, low-entropy encryption, and imitation attacks. Such powerful ransomware variants, privilege-escalated evasive ransomware (PEER), can defeat existing solutions relying on I/O-pattern analysis by tampering with or obfuscating I/O traces. Meanwhile, conventional statistical content-based detection becomes unreliable as the encryption size decreases due to sampling noises. We present Rhea, a cloud-offloaded ransomware defense system that analyzes replicated data snapshots, so-called mutation snapshots. Rhea introduces Format-Aware Validation that validates the syntactic and semantic correctness of file formats, instead of relying on statistical or entropy-based indicators. By leveraging file-format specifications as detection invariants, Rhea can reliably identify fine-grained and evasive encryption even under elevated attacker privileges. Our evaluation demonstrates that Rhea significantly outperforms existing approaches, establishing its practical effectiveness against modern ransomware threats.

Authors: Dezhang Kong, Zhuxi Wu, Shiqi Liu, Zhicheng Tan, Kuichen Lu, Minghao Li, Qichen Liu, Shengyu Chu, Zhenhua Xu, Xuan Liu, Meng Han

LLM-based web agents have become increasingly popular for their utility in daily life and work. However, they exhibit critical vulnerabilities when processing malicious URLs: accepting a disguised malicious URL enables subsequent access to unsafe webpages, which can cause severe damage to service providers and users. Despite this risk, no benchmark currently targets this emerging threat. To address this gap, we propose MalURLBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' vulnerabilities to malicious URLs. MalURLBench contains 61,845 attack instances spanning 10 real-world scenarios and 7 categories of real malicious websites. Experiments with 12 popular LLMs reveal that existing models struggle to detect elaborately disguised malicious URLs. We further identify and analyze key factors that impact attack success rates and propose URLGuard, a lightweight defense module. We believe this work will provide a foundational resource for advancing the security of web agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiangYingEr/MalURLBench.

### 8. [Mitigating the OWASP Top 10 For Large Language Models Applications using Intelligent Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18105v1)

Authors: Mohammad Fasha, Faisal Abul Rub, Nasim Matar, Bilal Sowan, Mohammad Al Khaldy

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative and disruptive technology, enabling a wide range of applications in natural language processing, machine translation, and beyond. However, this widespread integration of LLMs also raised several security concerns highlighted by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), which has identified the top 10 security vulnerabilities inherent in LLM applications. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial, given the increasing reliance on LLMs and the potential threats to data integrity, confidentiality, and service availability. This paper presents a framework designed to mitigate the security risks outlined in the OWASP Top 10. Our proposed model leverages LLM-enabled intelligent agents, offering a new approach to proactively identify, assess, and counteract security threats in real-time. The proposed framework serves as an initial blueprint for future research and development, aiming to enhance the security measures of LLMs and protect against emerging threats in this rapidly evolving landscape.

### 9. [XGuardian: Towards Explainable and Generalized AI Anti-Cheat on FPS Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18068v1)

Authors: Jiayi Zhang, Chenxin Sun, Chenxiong Qian

Aim-assist cheats are the most prevalent and infamous form of cheating in First-Person Shooter (FPS) games, which help cheaters illegally reveal the opponent's location and auto-aim and shoot, and thereby pose significant threats to the game industry. Although a considerable research effort has been made to automatically detect aim-assist cheats, existing works suffer from unreliable frameworks, limited generalizability, high overhead, low detection performance, and a lack of explainability of detection results. In this paper, we propose XGuardian, a server-side generalized and explainable system for detecting aim-assist cheats to overcome these limitations. It requires only two raw data inputs, pitch and yaw, which are all FPS games' must-haves, to construct novel temporal features and describe aim trajectories, which are essential for distinguishing cheaters and normal players. XGuardian is evaluated with the latest mainstream FPS game CS2, and validates its generalizability with another two different games. It achieves high detection performance and low overhead compared to prior works across different games with real-world and large-scale datasets, demonstrating wide generalizability and high effectiveness. It is able to justify its predictions and thereby shorten the ban cycle. We make XGuardian as well as our datasets publicly available.

### 10. [Multimodal Privacy-Preserving Entity Resolution with Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18612v1)

Authors: Susim Roy, Nalini Ratha

The canonical challenge of entity resolution within high-compliance sectors, where secure identity reconciliation is frequently confounded by significant data heterogeneity, including syntactic variations in personal identifiers, is a longstanding and complex problem. To this end, we introduce a novel multimodal framework operating with the voluminous data sets typical of government and financial institutions. Specifically, our methodology is designed to address the tripartite challenge of data volume, matching fidelity, and privacy. Consequently, the underlying plaintext of personally identifiable information remains computationally inaccessible throughout the matching lifecycle, empowering institutions to rigorously satisfy stringent regulatory mandates with cryptographic assurances of client confidentiality while achieving a demonstrably low equal error rate and maintaining computational tractability at scale.

Authors: Ignacio Antequera-Sánchez, Juan Luis Suárez-Díaz, Rosana Montes, Francisco Herrera

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a fundamental requirement for the reliable deployment of artificial intelligence applications in open-world environments. However, addressing the heterogeneous nature of OOD data, ranging from low-level corruption to semantic shifts, remains a complex challenge that single-stage detectors often fail to resolve. To address this issue, we propose SeNeDiF-OOD, a novel methodology based on Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion. This framework decomposes the detection task into a hierarchical structure of binary fusion nodes, where each layer is designed to integrate decision boundaries aligned with specific levels of semantic abstraction. To validate the proposed framework, we present a comprehensive case study using MonuMAI, a real-world architectural style recognition system exposed to an open environment. This application faces a diverse range of inputs, including non-monument images, unknown architectural styles, and adversarial attacks, making it an ideal testbed for our proposal. Through extensive experimental evaluation in this domain, results demonstrate that our hierarchical fusion methodology significantly outperforms traditional baselines, effectively filtering these diverse OOD categories while preserving in-distribution performance.

Authors: Judith Vilella-Cantos, Mauro Martini, Marcello Chiaberge, Mónica Ballesta, David Valiente

Localization in agricultural environments is challenging due to their unstructured nature and lack of distinctive landmarks. Although agricultural settings have been studied in the context of object classification and segmentation, the place recognition task for mobile robots is not trivial in the current state of the art. In this study, we propose MinkUNeXt-VINE, a lightweight, deep-learning-based method that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in vineyard environments thanks to its pre-processing and Matryoshka Representation Learning multi-loss approach. Our method prioritizes enhanced performance with low-cost, sparse LiDAR inputs and lower-dimensionality outputs to ensure high efficiency in real-time scenarios. Additionally, we present a comprehensive ablation study of the results on various evaluation cases and two extensive long-term vineyard datasets employing different LiDAR sensors. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the trade-off output produced by this approach, as well as its robust performance on low-cost and low-resolution input data. The code is publicly available for reproduction.

Offering great potential in robotic manipulation, a capable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model is expected to faithfully generalize across tasks and platforms while ensuring cost efficiency (e.g., data and GPU hours required for adaptation). To this end, we develop LingBot-VLA with around 20,000 hours of real-world data from 9 popular dual-arm robot configurations. Through a systematic assessment on 3 robotic platforms, each completing 100 tasks with 130 post-training episodes per task, our model achieves clear superiority over competitors, showcasing its strong performance and broad generalizability. We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8$\times$ (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.

Authors: Subhajeet Das, Susmita Ghosh, Abhiroop Chatterjee

Aerial images play a vital role in urban planning and environmental preservation, as they consist of various structures, representing different types of buildings, forests, mountains, and unoccupied lands. Due to its heterogeneous nature, developing robust models for scene classification remains a challenge. In this study, we conduct a literature review of various machine learning methods for aerial image classification. Our survey covers a range of approaches from handcrafted features (e.g., SIFT, LBP) to traditional CNNs (e.g., VGG, GoogLeNet), and advanced deep hybrid networks. In this connection, we have also designed Aerial-Y-Net, a spatial attention-enhanced CNN with multi-scale feature fusion mechanism, which acts as an attention-based model and helps us to better understand the complexities of aerial images. Evaluated on the AID dataset, our model achieves 91.72% accuracy, outperforming several baseline architectures.

Authors: Chao Wang, Xuanying Li, Cheng Dai, Jinglei Feng, Yuxiang Luo, Yuqi Ouyang, Hao Qin

Wireframe parsing aims to recover line segments and their junctions to form a structured geometric representation useful for downstream tasks such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Existing methods predict lines and junctions separately and reconcile them post-hoc, causing mismatches and reduced robustness. We present Co-PLNet, a point-line collaborative framework that exchanges spatial cues between the two tasks, where early detections are converted into spatial prompts via a Point-Line Prompt Encoder (PLP-Encoder), which encodes geometric attributes into compact and spatially aligned maps. A Cross-Guidance Line Decoder (CGL-Decoder) then refines predictions with sparse attention conditioned on complementary prompts, enforcing point-line consistency and efficiency. Experiments on Wireframe and YorkUrban show consistent improvements in accuracy and robustness, together with favorable real-time efficiency, demonstrating our effectiveness for structured geometry perception.

### 6. [Multi-Perspective Subimage CLIP with Keyword Guidance for Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18190v1)

Authors: Yifan Li, Shiying Wang, Jianqiang Huang

Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models like CLIP have significantly advanced Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR). However, existing methods predominantly rely on coarse-grained global alignment, which often overlooks the dense, multi-scale semantics inherent in overhead imagery. Moreover, adapting these heavy models via full fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational costs and risks catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose MPS-CLIP, a parameter-efficient framework designed to shift the retrieval paradigm from global matching to keyword-guided fine-grained alignment. Specifically, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract core semantic keywords, guiding the Segment Anything Model (SamGeo) to generate semantically relevant sub-perspectives. To efficiently adapt the frozen backbone, we introduce a Gated Global Attention (G^2A) adapter, which captures global context and long-range dependencies with minimal overhead. Furthermore, a Multi-Perspective Representation (MPR) module aggregates these local cues into robust multi-perspective embeddings. The framework is optimized via a hybrid objective combining multi-perspective contrastive and weighted triplet losses, which dynamically selects maximum-response perspectives to suppress noise and enforce precise semantic matching. Extensive experiments on the RSICD and RSITMD benchmarks demonstrate that MPS-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35.18% and 48.40% mean Recall (mR), respectively, significantly outperforming full fine-tuning baselines and recent competitive methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Lcrucial1f/MPS-CLIP.

Authors: Aniket Rege, Arka Sadhu, Yuliang Li, Kejie Li, Ramya Korlakai Vinayak, Yuning Chai, Yong Jae Lee, Hyo Jin Kim

The advent of always-on personal AI assistants, enabled by all-day wearable devices such as smart glasses, demands a new level of contextual understanding, one that goes beyond short, isolated events to encompass the continuous, longitudinal stream of egocentric video. Achieving this vision requires advances in long-horizon video understanding, where systems must interpret and recall visual and audio information spanning days or even weeks. Existing methods, including large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, are constrained by limited context windows and lack the ability to perform compositional, multi-hop reasoning over very long video streams. In this work, we address these challenges through EGAgent, an enhanced agentic framework centered on entity scene graphs, which represent people, places, objects, and their relationships over time. Our system equips a planning agent with tools for structured search and reasoning over these graphs, as well as hybrid visual and audio search capabilities, enabling detailed, cross-modal, and temporally coherent reasoning. Experiments on the EgoLifeQA and Video-MME (Long) datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on EgoLifeQA (57.5%) and competitive performance on Video-MME (Long) (74.1%) for complex longitudinal video understanding tasks.

### 8. [LungCRCT: Causal Representation based Lung CT Processing for Lung Cancer Treatment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18118v1)

Authors: Daeyoung Kim

Due to silence in early stages, lung cancer has been one of the most leading causes of mortality in cancer patients world-wide. Moreover, major symptoms of lung cancer are hard to differentiate with other respiratory disease symptoms such as COPD, further leading patients to overlook cancer progression in early stages. Thus, to enhance survival rates in lung cancer, early detection from consistent proactive respiratory system monitoring becomes crucial. One of the most prevalent and effective methods for lung cancer monitoring would be low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) chest scans, which led to remarkable enhancements in lung cancer detection or tumor classification tasks under rapid advancements and applications of computer vision based AI models such as EfficientNet or ResNet in image processing. However, though advanced CNN models under transfer learning or ViT based models led to high performing lung cancer detections, due to its intrinsic limitations in terms of correlation dependence and low interpretability due to complexity, expansions of deep learning models to lung cancer treatment analysis or causal intervention analysis simulations are still limited. Therefore, this research introduced LungCRCT: a latent causal representation learning based lung cancer analysis framework that retrieves causal representations of factors within the physical causal mechanism of lung cancer progression. With the use of advanced graph autoencoder based causal discovery algorithms with distance Correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement, LungCRCT not only enables causal intervention analysis for lung cancer treatments, but also leads to robust, yet extremely light downstream models in malignant tumor classification tasks with an AUC score of 93.91%.

### 9. [Differentiable Architecture Search for Adversarially Robust Quantum Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18058v1)

Authors: Mohamed Afane, Quanjiang Long, Haoting Shen, Ying Mao, Junaid Farooq, Ying Wang, Juntao Chen

Current quantum neural networks suffer from extreme sensitivity to both adversarial perturbations and hardware noise, creating a significant barrier to real-world deployment. Existing robustness techniques typically sacrifice clean accuracy or require prohibitive computational resources. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS) framework that addresses these limitations by jointly optimizing circuit structure and robustness through gradient-based methods. Our approach enhances traditional DQAS with a lightweight Classical Noise Layer applied before quantum processing, enabling simultaneous optimization of gate selection and noise parameters. This design preserves the quantum circuit's integrity while introducing trainable perturbations that enhance robustness without compromising standard performance. Experimental validation on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR datasets shows consistent improvements in both clean and adversarial accuracy compared to existing quantum architecture search methods. Under various attack scenarios, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Momentum Iterative Method (MIM), and under realistic quantum noise conditions, our hybrid framework maintains superior performance. Testing on actual quantum hardware confirms the practical viability of discovered architectures. These results demonstrate that strategic classical preprocessing combined with differentiable quantum architecture optimization can significantly enhance quantum neural network robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.

### 10. [A Tumor Aware DenseNet Swin Hybrid Learning with Boosted and Hierarchical Feature Spaces for Large-Scale Brain MRI Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18330v1)

Authors: Muhammad Ali Shah, Muhammad Mansoor Alam, Saddam Hussain Khan

This study proposes an efficient Densely Swin Hybrid (EDSH) framework for brain tumor MRI analysis, designed to jointly capture fine grained texture patterns and long range contextual dependencies. Two tumor aware experimental setups are introduced to address class-specific diagnostic challenges. The first setup employs a Boosted Feature Space (BFS), where independently customized DenseNet and Swint branches learn complementary local and global representations that are dimension aligned, fused, and boosted, enabling highly sensitive detection of diffuse glioma patterns by successfully learning the features of irregular shape, poorly defined mass, and heterogeneous texture. The second setup adopts a hierarchical DenseNet Swint architecture with Deep Feature Extraction have Dual Residual connections (DFE and DR), in which DenseNet serves as a stem CNN for structured local feature learning, while Swin_t models global tumor morphology, effectively suppressing false negatives in meningioma and pituitary tumor classification by learning the features of well defined mass, location (outside brain) and enlargments in tumors (dural tail or upward extension). DenseNet is customized at the input level to match MRI spatial characteristics, leveraging dense residual connectivity to preserve texture information and mitigate vanishing-gradient effects. In parallel, Swint is tailored through task aligned patch embedding and shifted-window self attention to efficiently capture hierarchical global dependencies. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale MRI dataset (stringent 40,260 images across four tumor classes) demonstrates consistent superiority over standalone CNNs, Vision Transformers, and hybrids, achieving 98.50 accuracy and recall on the test unseen dataset.

Authors: Abdulaziz AlDakheel, Ali Alshehre, Esraa Alamoudi, Moslim AlKhabbaz, Ahmed Aljohani, Raed Alharbi

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly becoming embedded in Saudi Arabia's digital transformation under Vision 2030, yet public awareness, adoption, and concerns surrounding these tools remain underexplored. This study provides an early snapshot of GenAI engagement among Saudi nationals. Using a nationwide survey of 330 participants across regions, age groups, and employment sectors, we examine seven dimensions of GenAI use: awareness and understanding, adoption patterns, perceived impacts, training needs, risks and barriers, data-sharing behaviors, and future expectations. Findings show that 93% of respondents actively use GenAI primarily for text-based tasks, while more advanced uses such as programming or multimodal generation are less common. Despite the prevalence of use, overall awareness and conceptual understanding remain uneven, with many reporting limited technical knowledge. Participants recognize GenAI's benefits for productivity, work quality, and understanding complex information, yet caution that sustained reliance may undermine critical thinking and key professional skills. Trust in AI-generated outputs remains cautious, with widespread concerns about privacy, misinformation, and ethical misuse, including potential job displacement. Respondents show strong interest in structured GenAI training that combines foundational skills, domain-specific applications, and clear guidance on privacy, ethics, and responsible use. These results establish a baseline for GenAI engagement in Saudi Arabia and highlight priorities for policymakers and developers: expanding AI literacy, ensuring culturally and linguistically aligned GenAI solutions, and strengthening frameworks for privacy and responsible deployment.

### 2. [Rethinking AI in the age of climate collapse: Ethics, power, and responsibility](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18462v1)

Authors: Julio Vega

The climate crisis requires responses that integrate scientific, ethical, social, and technological perspectives. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in climate modelling, environmental monitoring, and energy optimisation, yet its growing use also raises critical environmental, ethical, legal, and social questions. This contribution examines the ambivalent role of AI in the ecological crisis, addressing both its promises and its risks. On the one hand, AI supports improvements in climate forecasting, renewable energy management, and real-time detection of environmental degradation. On the other hand, the energy demands of data centres, resource-intensive hardware production, algorithmic bias, corporate concentration of power, and technocratic decision-making reveal contradictions that challenge its sustainability. The discussion explores these issues through interdisciplinary lenses, including environmental ethics, philosophy of technology, and legal governance, and concludes with recommendations for socially just, ecologically responsible, and democratically accountable uses of AI. Rather than assuming AI as an inherently sustainable solution, this analysis argues that its contribution to climate action depends fundamentally on the values, institutions, and power structures that shape its development.

Authors: Onyedikachi Hope Amaechi-Okorie, Branislav Radeljic

Speech remains one of the most visible yet overlooked vectors of inclusion and exclusion in contemporary society. While fluency is often equated with credibility and competence, individuals with atypical speech patterns are routinely marginalized. Given the current state of the debate, this article focuses on the structural biases that shape perceptions of atypical speech and are now being encoded into artificial intelligence. Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems and voice interfaces, trained predominantly on standardized speech, routinely fail to recognize or respond to diverse voices, compounding digital exclusion. As AI technologies increasingly mediate access to opportunity, the study calls for inclusive technological design, anti-bias training to minimize the impact of discriminatory algorithmic decisions, and enforceable policy reform that explicitly recognize speech diversity as a matter of equity, not merely accessibility. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, the article advocates for a cultural and institutional shift in how we value voice, urging co-created solutions that elevate the rights, representation, and realities of atypical speakers in the digital age. Ultimately, the article reframes speech inclusion as a matter of equity (not accommodation) and advocates for co-created AI systems that reflect the full spectrum of human voices.

### 4. [Demographic Probing of Large Language Models Lacks Construct Validity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18486v1)

Demographic probing is widely used to study how large language models (LLMs) adapt their behavior to signaled demographic attributes. This approach typically uses a single demographic cue in isolation (e.g., a name or dialect) as a signal for group membership, implicitly assuming strong construct validity: that such cues are interchangeable operationalizations of the same underlying, demographically conditioned behavior. We test this assumption in realistic advice-seeking interactions, focusing on race and gender in a U.S. context. We find that cues intended to represent the same demographic group induce only partially overlapping changes in model behavior, while differentiation between groups within a given cue is weak and uneven. Consequently, estimated disparities are unstable, with both magnitude and direction varying across cues. We further show that these inconsistencies partly arise from variation in how strongly cues encode demographic attributes and from linguistic confounders that independently shape model behavior. Together, our findings suggest that demographic probing lacks construct validity: it does not yield a single, stable characterization of how LLMs condition on demographic information, which may reflect a misspecified or fragmented construct. We conclude by recommending the use of multiple, ecologically valid cues and explicit control of confounders to support more defensible claims about demographic effects in LLMs.

### 5. [When Is Self-Disclosure Optimal? Incentives and Governance of AI-Generated Content](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18654v1)

Authors: Juan Wu, Zhe, Zhang, Amit Mehra

Generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) is reshaping content creation on digital platforms by reducing production costs and enabling scalable output of varying quality. In response, platforms have begun adopting disclosure policies that require creators to label AI-generated content, often supported by imperfect detection and penalties for non-compliance. This paper develops a formal model to study the economic implications of such disclosure regimes. We compare a non-disclosure benchmark, in which the platform alone detects AI usage, with a mandatory self-disclosure regime in which creators strategically choose whether to disclose or conceal AI use under imperfect enforcement. The model incorporates heterogeneous creators, viewer discounting of AI-labeled content, trust penalties following detected non-disclosure, and endogenous enforcement. The analysis shows that disclosure is optimal only when both the value of AI-generated content and its cost-saving advantage are intermediate. As AI capability improves, the platform's optimal enforcement strategy evolves from strict deterrence to partial screening and eventual deregulation. While disclosure reliably increases transparency, it reduces aggregate creator surplus and can suppress high-quality AI content when AI is technologically advanced. Overall, the results characterize disclosure as a strategic governance instrument whose effectiveness depends on technological maturity and trust frictions.

Authors: João Phillipe Cardenuto, Ana Carolina Monari, Michelle Diniz Lopes, Leopoldo Lusquino Filho, Anderson Rocha

Over the past decade, Brazil has experienced a decline in vaccination coverage, reversing decades of public health progress achieved through the National Immunization Program (PNI). Growing evidence points to the widespread circulation of vaccine-related misinformation -- particularly on social media platforms -- as a key factor driving this decline. Among these platforms, Telegram remains the only major platform permitting accessible and ethical data collection, offering insight into public channels where vaccine misinformation circulates extensively. This data paper introduces a curated dataset of about four million Telegram posts collected from 119 prominent Brazilian anti-vaccine channels between 2020 and 2025. The dataset includes message content, metadata, associated media, and classification related to vaccine posts, enabling researchers to examine how false or misleading information spreads, evolves, and influences public sentiment. By providing this resource, our aim is to support the scientific and public health community in developing evidence-based strategies to counter misinformation, promote trust in vaccination, and engage compassionately with individuals and communities affected by false narratives. The dataset and documentation are openly available for non-commercial research, under strict ethical and privacy guidelines at https://doi.org/10.25824/redu/5JIVDT

### 7. [When Nobody Around Is Real: Exploring Public Opinions and User Experiences On the Multi-Agent AI Social Platform](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18275v1)

Authors: Qiufang Yu, Mengmeng Wu, Xingyu Lan

Powered by large language models, a new genre of multi-agent social platforms has emerged. Apps such as Social.AI deploy numerous AI agents that emulate human behavior, creating unprecedented bot-centric social networks. Yet, existing research has predominantly focused on one-on-one chatbots, leaving multi-agent AI platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we took Social.AI as a case study and performed a two-stage investigation: (i) content analysis of 883 user comments; (ii) a 7-day diary study with 20 participants to document their firsthand platform experiences. While public discourse expressed greater skepticism, the diary study found that users did project a range of social expectations onto the AI agents. While some user expectations were met, the AI-dominant social environment introduces distinct problems, such as attention overload and homogenized interaction. These tensions signal a future where AI functions not merely as a tool or an anthropomorphized actor, but as the dominant medium of sociality itself-a paradigm shift that foregrounds new forms of architected social life.

### 8. [Corpus-Based Approaches to Igbo Diacritic Restoration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18380v1)

Authors: Ignatius Ezeani

With natural language processing (NLP), researchers aim to enable computers to identify and understand patterns in human languages. This is often difficult because a language embeds many dynamic and varied properties in its syntax, pragmatics and phonology, which need to be captured and processed. The capacity of computers to process natural languages is increasing because NLP researchers are pushing its boundaries. But these research works focus more on well-resourced languages such as English, Japanese, German, French, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, etc. Over 95% of the world's 7000 languages are low-resourced for NLP, i.e. they have little or no data, tools, and techniques for NLP work.
  In this thesis, we present an overview of diacritic ambiguity and a review of previous diacritic disambiguation approaches on other languages. Focusing on the Igbo language, we report the steps taken to develop a flexible framework for generating datasets for diacritic restoration. Three main approaches, the standard n-gram model, the classification models and the embedding models were proposed. The standard n-gram models use a sequence of previous words to the target stripped word as key predictors of the correct variants. For the classification models, a window of words on both sides of the target stripped word was used. The embedding models compare the similarity scores of the combined context word embeddings and the embeddings of each of the candidate variant vectors.

### 9. [Beyond Pairwise Comparisons: A Distributional Test of Distinctiveness for Machine-Generated Works in Intellectual Property Law](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18156v1)

Authors: Anirban Mukherjee, Hannah Hanwen Chang

Key doctrines, including novelty (patent), originality (copyright), and distinctiveness (trademark), turn on a shared empirical question: whether a body of work is meaningfully distinct from a relevant reference class. Yet analyses typically operationalize this set-level inquiry using item-level evidence: pairwise comparisons among exemplars. That unit-of-analysis mismatch may be manageable for finite corpora of human-created works, where it can be bridged by ad hoc aggregations. But it becomes acute for machine-generated works, where the object of evaluation is not a fixed set of works but a generative process with an effectively unbounded output space. We propose a distributional alternative: a two-sample test based on maximum mean discrepancy computed on semantic embeddings to determine if two creative processes-whether human or machine-produce statistically distinguishable output distributions. The test requires no task-specific training-obviating the need for discovery of proprietary training data to characterize the generative process-and is sample-efficient, often detecting differences with as few as 5-10 images and 7-20 texts. We validate the framework across three domains: handwritten digits (controlled images), patent abstracts (text), and AI-generated art (real-world images). We reveal a perceptual paradox: even when human evaluators distinguish AI outputs from human-created art with only about 58% accuracy, our method detects distributional distinctiveness. Our results present evidence contrary to the view that generative models act as mere regurgitators of training data. Rather than producing outputs statistically indistinguishable from a human baseline-as simple regurgitation would predict-they produce outputs that are semantically human-like yet stochastically distinct, suggesting their dominant function is as a semantic interpolator within a learned latent space.

Authors: Judy Hanwen Shen, Ken Liu, Angelina Wang, Sarah H. Cen, Andy K. Zhang, Caroline Meinhardt, Daniel Zhang, Kevin Klyman, Rishi Bommasani, Daniel E. Ho

Data transparency has emerged as a rallying cry for addressing concerns about AI: data quality, privacy, and copyright chief among them. Yet while these calls are crucial for accountability, current transparency policies often fall short of their intended aims. Similar to nutrition facts for food, policies aimed at nutrition facts for AI currently suffer from a limited consideration of research on effective disclosures. We offer an institutional perspective and identify three common fallacies in policy implementations of data disclosures for AI. First, many data transparency proposals exhibit a specification gap between the stated goals of data transparency and the actual disclosures necessary to achieve such goals. Second, reform attempts exhibit an enforcement gap between required disclosures on paper and enforcement to ensure compliance in fact. Third, policy proposals manifest an impact gap between disclosed information and meaningful changes in developer practices and public understanding. Informed by the social science on transparency, our analysis identifies affirmative paths for transparency that are effective rather than merely symbolic.

### 1. [UTune: Towards Uncertainty-Aware Online Index Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18199v1)

Authors: Chenning Wu, Sifan Chen, Wentao Wu, Yinan Jing, Zhenying He, Kai Zhang, X. Sean Wang

There have been a flurry of recent proposals on learned benefit estimators for index tuning. Although these learned estimators show promising improvement over what-if query optimizer calls in terms of the accuracy of estimated index benefit, they face significant limitations when applied to online index tuning, an arguably more common and more challenging scenario in real-world applications. There are two major challenges for learned index benefit estimators in online tuning: (1) limited amount of query execution feedback that can be used to train the models, and (2) constant coming of new unseen queries due to workload drifts. The combination of the two hinders the generalization capability of existing learned index benefit estimators. To overcome these challenges, we present UTune, an uncertainty-aware online index tuning framework that employs operator-level learned models with improved generalization over unseen queries. At the core of UTune is an uncertainty quantification mechanism that characterizes the inherent uncertainty of the operator-level learned models given limited online execution feedback. We further integrate uncertainty information into index selection and configuration enumeration, the key component of any index tuner, by developing a new variant of the classic $ε$-greedy search strategy with uncertainty-weighted index benefits. Experimental evaluation shows that UTune not only significantly improves the workload execution time compared to state-of-the-art online index tuners but also reduces the index exploration overhead, resulting in faster convergence when the workload is relatively stable.

### 2. [MultiVis-Agent: A Multi-Agent Framework with Logic Rules for Reliable and Comprehensive Cross-Modal Data Visualization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18320v1)

Authors: Jinwei Lu, Yuanfeng Song, Chen Zhang, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong

Real-world visualization tasks involve complex, multi-modal requirements that extend beyond simple text-to-chart generation, requiring reference images, code examples, and iterative refinement. Current systems exhibit fundamental limitations: single-modality input, one-shot generation, and rigid workflows. While LLM-based approaches show potential for these complex requirements, they introduce reliability challenges including catastrophic failures and infinite loop susceptibility. To address this gap, we propose MultiVis-Agent, a logic rule-enhanced multi-agent framework for reliable multi-modal and multi-scenario visualization generation. Our approach introduces a four-layer logic rule framework that provides mathematical guarantees for system reliability while maintaining flexibility. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our logic rules are mathematical constraints that guide LLM reasoning rather than replacing it. We formalize the MultiVis task spanning four scenarios from basic generation to iterative refinement, and develop MultiVis-Bench, a benchmark with over 1,000 cases for multi-modal visualization evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves 75.63% visualization score on challenging tasks, significantly outperforming baselines (57.54-62.79%), with task completion rates of 99.58% and code execution success rates of 94.56% (vs. 74.48% and 65.10% without logic rules), successfully addressing both complexity and reliability challenges in automated visualization generation.

### 3. [Capturing P: On the Expressive Power and Efficient Evaluation of Boolean Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18747v1)

Authors: Amir Aavani

Modern information retrieval is transitioning from simple document filtering to complex, neuro-symbolic reasoning workflows. However, current retrieval architectures face a fundamental efficiency dilemma when handling the rigorous logical and arithmetic constraints required by this new paradigm. Standard iterator-based engines (Document-at-a-Time) do not natively support complex, nested logic graphs; forcing them to execute such queries typically results in intractable runtime performance. Conversely, naive recursive approaches (Term-at-a-Time), while capable of supporting these structures, suffer from prohibitive memory consumption when enforcing broad logical exclusions.
  In this paper, we propose that a retrieval engine must be capable of ``Capturing $\mathbf{P}$'' -- evaluating any polynomial-time property directly over its index in a computationally efficient manner. We define a formal Retrieval Language ($\mathcal{L}_R$) based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and prove it precisely captures the complexity class $\mathbf{P}$. We introduce \texttt{ComputePN}, a novel evaluation algorithm that makes $\mathcal{L}_R$ tractable. By combining native DAG traversal with a memory-efficient ``Positive-Negative'' response mechanism, \texttt{ComputePN} ensures the efficient evaluation of any query in $\mathcal{L}_R$. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for turning the search index into a general-purpose computational engine.

Authors: Beom Heyn Kim, Seok Min Hong, Mohammad Mannan

Ransomware variants increasingly combine privilege escalation with sophisticated evasion strategies such as intermittent encryption, low-entropy encryption, and imitation attacks. Such powerful ransomware variants, privilege-escalated evasive ransomware (PEER), can defeat existing solutions relying on I/O-pattern analysis by tampering with or obfuscating I/O traces. Meanwhile, conventional statistical content-based detection becomes unreliable as the encryption size decreases due to sampling noises. We present Rhea, a cloud-offloaded ransomware defense system that analyzes replicated data snapshots, so-called mutation snapshots. Rhea introduces Format-Aware Validation that validates the syntactic and semantic correctness of file formats, instead of relying on statistical or entropy-based indicators. By leveraging file-format specifications as detection invariants, Rhea can reliably identify fine-grained and evasive encryption even under elevated attacker privileges. Our evaluation demonstrates that Rhea significantly outperforms existing approaches, establishing its practical effectiveness against modern ransomware threats.

### 2. [An Adaptive Purification Controller for Quantum Networks: Dynamic Protocol Selection and Multipartite Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18351v1)

Authors: Pranav Kulkarni, Leo Sünkel, Michael Kölle

Efficient entanglement distribution is the cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that autonomously optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the "goodput," the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families (e.g., BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results demonstrate that our approach eliminates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, demonstrating robustness for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, confirming real-time feasibility with decision latencies in the millisecond range per link.

### 3. [An Initial Evaluation of Distributed Graph Algorithms using NWGraph and HPX](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18158v1)

Authors: Karame Mohammadiporshokooh, Panagiotis Syskakis, Hartmut Kaiser

Graphs are central to modeling relationships in scientific computing, data analysis, and AI/ML, but their growing scale can exceed the memory and compute capacity of single nodes, requiring distributed solutions. Existing distributed graph framework, however, face fundamental challenges: graph algorithms are latency-bound, suffer from irregular memory access, and often impose synchronization costs that limit scalability and efficiency. In this work, we present a distributed implementation of the NWGraph library integrated with the HPX runtime system. By leveraging HPX's asynchronous many-task model, our approach aims to reduce synchronization overhead, improve load balance, and provide a foundation for distributed graph analytics. We evaluate this approach using two representative algorithms: Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and (PageRank). Our initial results show that BFS achieves better performance than the distributed Boost Graph Library (BGL), while PageRank remains more challenging, with current implementation not yet outperforming BGL. These findings highlight both the promise and the open challenges of applying asynchronous task-based runtimes to graph processing, and point to opportunities for future optimizations and extensions.

### 4. [On the Bandwidth Consumption of Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18400v1)

Authors: Andrei Lebedev, Vincent Gramoli

With the advent of blockchain technology, the number of proposals has boomed. The network traffic imposed by these blockchain proposals increases the cost of hosting nodes. Unfortunately, as of today, we are not aware of any comparative study of the bandwidth consumption of blockchains.
  In this paper, we propose the first empirical comparison of blockchain bandwidth consumption. To this end, we measure the network traffic of blockchain network nodes of five blockchain protocols: Algorand, Aptos, Avalanche, Redbelly and Solana. We study the variation over time, differentiate the receiving and sending traffic and analyze how this traffic varies with the number of nodes and validators.
  We conclude that the transport protocol is the main factor impacting the network traffic, segregating node roles helps reduce traffic and different blockchains are differently impacted by the network size.

Authors: Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe

Recently, we have often observed hallucinated citations or references that do not correspond to any existing work in papers under review, preprints, or published papers. Such hallucinated citations pose a serious concern to scientific reliability. When they appear in accepted papers, they may also negatively affect the credibility of conferences. In this study, we refer to hallucinated citations as "HalluCitation" and systematically investigate their prevalence and impact. We analyze all papers published at ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP in 2024 and 2025, including main conference, Findings, and workshop papers. Our analysis reveals that nearly 300 papers contain at least one HalluCitation, most of which were published in 2025. Notably, half of these papers were identified at EMNLP 2025, the most recent conference, indicating that this issue is rapidly increasing. Moreover, more than 100 such papers were accepted as main conference and Findings papers at EMNLP 2025, affecting the credibility.

### 2. [Designing large language model prompts to extract scores from messy text: A shared dataset and challenge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18271v1)

Authors: Mike Thelwall

In some areas of computing, natural language processing and information science, progress is made by sharing datasets and challenging the community to design the best algorithm for an associated task. This article introduces a shared dataset of 1446 short texts, each of which describes a research quality score on the UK scale of 1* to 4*. This is a messy collection, with some texts not containing scores and others including invalid scores or strange formats. With this dataset there is also a description of what constitutes a valid score and a "gold standard" of the correct scores for these texts (including missing values). The challenge is to design a prompt for Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the scores from these texts as accurately as possible. The format for the response should be a number and no other text so there are two aspects to the challenge: ensuring that the LLM returns only a number, and instructing it to deduce the correct number for the text. As part of this, the LLM prompt needs to explain when to return the missing value code, -1, instead of a number when the text does not clearly contain one. The article also provides an example of a simple prompt. The purpose of the challenge is twofold: to get an effective solution to this problem, and to increase understanding of prompt design and LLM capabilities for complex numerical tasks. The initial solution suggested has an accuracy of 72.6%, so the challenge is to beat this.

Authors: Neil R. Smalheiser, Joe D. Menke, Arthur W. Holt, Halil Kilicoglu, Jodi Schneider

Objectives. Major research and implementation efforts have been devoted to indexing articles according to the major topics discussed, but much less effort to indexing their publication types and study designs (collectively, PTs). In this Perspective, we discuss how indexing PTs differs from topical MeSH indexing and requires a different approach. Materials and Methods. Rather than focus on the technical aspects of machine learning-based indexing models, we emphasize the goals and purposes for which biomedical articles are indexed, and the surprisingly thorny question of how indexing systems should be evaluated. Results. Topical Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms are assigned to articles that cover the major topics discussed; when more than one term is applicable, only the most specific term is assigned. In contrast, PTs are assigned to articles that have a given structure or use a particular design. To meet the needs of end users, particularly groups involved in evidence syntheses, PT indexing needs to be comprehensive and employ probabilistic prediction scores. Whereas existing NLM hierarchies place publication types and study design-related terms on separate trees from each other, a unified rubric permits more appropriate retrieval via automatic expansion. Discussion. Automated PT indexing systems should allow users to input article records or full text pdfs and receive scores in real time. This will offer consistent indexing across bibliographic databases, as well as preprints and unpublished manuscripts. Conclusions. Automated PT indexing systems, properly designed and implemented, hold the promise of greatly improving the retrieval of biomedical articles, saving substantial effort when writing evidence syntheses and benefiting other users as well.

Authors: François Renaville, Fabienne Prosmans

This chapter examines the evolution of library services at the University of Liège (ULiège), with a focus on the implementation and assessment of the LibCal Seats booking module. Introduced in September 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this system was designed to manage occupancy and maintain social distancing. While initially a temporary measure, the seat booking service remains in use during peak periods. Drawing on survey data from 2022 and 2023, the chapter analyses user perceptions of the system. Results indicate strong student appreciation, particularly regarding stress reduction and equitable access to study spaces. Despite overall satisfaction, issues such as unoccupied reserved seats and an unnecessarily complex booking process emerged, leading to targeted improvements. This chapter highlights the importance of responsive, user-centred services in academic libraries. The adoption of the booking system helped address challenges such as overcrowding and "seat hogging," ultimately contributing to a more organised and accessible environment. The case study illustrates how technology can enhance library service delivery, offering insights for institutions seeking to optimise space management. The continued evaluation of the system reflects a broader commitment to adapting services in alignment with user needs and institutional priorities.

### 1. [On the Subspace Orbit Problem and the Simultaneous Skolem Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18349v1)

Authors: Piotr Bacik, Anton Varonka

The Orbit Problem asks whether the orbit of a point under a matrix reaches a given target set. When the target is a single point, the problem was shown to be decidable in polynomial time by Kannan and Lipton. This decidability result was later extended by Chonev et al. to targets of dimension 3 (in arbitrary ambient dimension), but decidability remains open for subspaces of dimension 4. At the other extreme, the special case of the Orbit Problem in which the target set is a hyperplane of codimension 1 is equivalent to the Skolem Problem for linear recurrence sequences, whose decidability has been open for many decades.
  In this paper, we show that the Orbit Problem is decidable if the target subspace has dimension logarithmic in the dimension of the orbit. Over rationals, we moreover obtain a complexity bound NP^RP in this case. On the other hand, we show that the version of the Orbit Problem where the dimension of the target subspace is linear in the dimension of the orbit is as hard as the Skolem Problem.

### 2. [Di-Graphs with tightly connected Clusters: Effective Graph Laplacians and Resolvent Convergence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18057v1)

Authors: Christian Koke

In this note, we study Laplacians on graphs for which connectivity within certain sub-graphs tends to infinity. Our main focus are graphs sharing a common node set on which edge weights within certain clusters grow to infinity. As intra-cluster connectivity increases, we show that the corresponding graph Laplacians converge -- in the resolvent sense -- to an effective graph Laplacian. This effective limit Laplacian is defined on a coarsened graph, where each highly connected cluster is collapsed into a single node. In the undirected setting, the effective Laplacian arises naturally from agregating over tightly connected clusters. In the directed case, the limiting graph structure depends on the precise manner in which connectivity increases; with the corresponding effects mediated by the left and right kernel structure of the Laplacian restricted to high-connectivity clusters. Our results shed light on the emergence of coarse-grained dynamics in large-scale networks and contribute to spectral graph theory of directed graphs.

### 3. [Additive sink subtraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18715v1)

Authors: Anjali Bhagat, Urban Larsson, Hikaru Manabe, Takahiro Yamashita

Subtraction games are a classical topic in Combinatorial Game Theory. A result of Golomb~(1966) shows that every subtraction game with a finite move set has an eventually periodic nim-sequence, but the known proof yields only an exponential upper bound on the period length. Flammenkamp (1997) conjectures a striking classification for three-move subtraction games: non-additive rulesets exhibit linear period lengths of the form ``the sum of two moves'', where the choice of which two moves displays fractal-like behavior, while additive sets $S=\{a,b,a+b\}$ have purely periodic outcomes with linear or quadratic period lengths. Despite early attention in \emph{Winning Ways} (1982), the general additive case remains open. We introduce and analyze a dual winning convention, which we call {\sc sink subtraction}. Unlike the standard wall convention, where moves to negative positions are forbidden, the sink convention declares a player the winner upon moving to a non-positive position. We show that {\sc additive sink subtraction} admits a complete solution: the nim-sequence is purely periodic with an explicit linear or quadratic period formula, and we conjecture a duality between additive sink subtraction and classical wall subtraction. Keywords: Additive Subtraction Game, Nimber, Periodicity, Sink Convention.

### 4. [Remarks about Connection and Dirac matrices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18071v1)

Authors: Oliver Knill

The connection Laplacian L and the Dirac matrix D are both n x n matrices defined from a given finite simplicial complex G with n sets. In both cases, there is interlacing of the eigenvalues for subcomplexes. This gives general upper bounds of the eigenvalues both for L and D in terms of inclusion or intersection degrees. We conjecture that L always dominates both D and the inverse of L in a weak Loewner sense. In a second part we look at dynamical systems (G,T), where T is a simplicial map on G. Both L and D generalize to dynamical versions of L and D. The modified L is still unimodular with an explicit Green function inverse and modified Dirac part still comes from an exterior derivative d. We also review the Lefschetz fixed point theorem for a simplicial map T on a simplicial complex G which implies the Brouwer fixed point theorem: any simplicial map on a contractible finite abstract simplicial complex G has a fixed simplex.

### 5. [Distinguishing Graphs by Counting Homomorphisms from Sparse Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18602v1)

Authors: Daniel Neuen, Tim Seppelt

Lovász (1967) showed that two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if, and only if, they are homomorphism indistinguishable over all graphs, i.e., $G$ and $H$ admit the same number of number of homomorphisms from every graph $F$. Subsequently, a substantial line of work studied homomorphism indistinguishability over restricted graph classes. For example, homomorphism indistinguishability over minor-closed graph classes $\mathcal{F}$ such as the class of planar graphs, the class of graphs of treewidth $\leq k$, pathwidth $\leq k$, or treedepth $\leq k$, was shown to be equivalent to quantum isomorphism and equivalences with respect to counting logic fragments, respectively.
  Via such characterisations, the distinguishing power of e.g. logical or quantum graph isomorphism relaxations can be studied with graph-theoretic means. In this vein, Roberson (2022) conjectured that homomorphism indistinguishability over every graph class excluding some minor is not the same as isomorphism. We prove this conjecture for all vortex-free graph classes. In particular, homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded Euler genus is not the same as isomorphism. As a negative result, we show that Roberson's conjecture fails when generalised to graph classes excluding a topological minor.
  Furthermore, we show homomorphism distinguishing closedness for several graph classes including all topological-minor-closed and union-closed classes of forests, and show that homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of genus $\leq g$ (and other parameters) forms a strict hierarchy.

Authors: Jamolidin K. Abdurakhmanov

We investigate the existence of heavy columns in binary matrices with distinct rows. A column of an m x n binary matrix is called heavy if the number of ones in it is at least m/2. We introduce two recursive algorithms, A1 and A2, that examine properties of subma trices obtained by row filtering and column deletion. We prove that if algorithm A1 returns True for a binary matrix with distinct rows, then the matrix contains at least one heavy column (Theorem 1). Further more, we prove that if algorithm A2 returns True for a binary matrix with distinct rows, distinct columns, and no all-zero columns, then the matrix also contains at least one heavy column (Theorem 2). The key innovation in A2 is an early termination condition: if exactly one row has a zero in some column, that column is immediately identified as heavy. The proofs employ a novel argument based on the existence of unpaired rows with respect to specific columns, combined with careful analysis of the recursive structure of the algorithms.

### 1. [Robust Learning of a Group DRO Neuron](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18115v1)

Authors: Guyang Cao, Shuyao Li, Sushrut Karmalkar, Jelena Diakonikolas

We study the problem of learning a single neuron under standard squared loss in the presence of arbitrary label noise and group-level distributional shifts, for a broad family of covariate distributions. Our goal is to identify a ''best-fit'' neuron parameterized by $\mathbf{w}_*$ that performs well under the most challenging reweighting of the groups. Specifically, we address a Group Distributionally Robust Optimization problem: given sample access to $K$ distinct distributions $\mathcal p_{[1]},\dots,\mathcal p_{[K]}$, we seek to approximate $\mathbf{w}_*$ that minimizes the worst-case objective over convex combinations of group distributions $\boldsymbolλ \in Δ_K$, where the objective is $\sum_{i \in [K]}λ_{[i]}\,\mathbb E_{(\mathbf x,y)\sim\mathcal p_{[i]}}(σ(\mathbf w\cdot\mathbf x)-y)^2 - νd_f(\boldsymbolλ,\frac{1}{K}\mathbf1)$ and $d_f$ is an $f$-divergence that imposes (optional) penalty on deviations from uniform group weights, scaled by a parameter $ν\geq 0$. We develop a computationally efficient primal-dual algorithm that outputs a vector $\widehat{\mathbf w}$ that is constant-factor competitive with $\mathbf{w}_*$ under the worst-case group weighting. Our analytical framework directly confronts the inherent nonconvexity of the loss function, providing robust learning guarantees in the face of arbitrary label corruptions and group-specific distributional shifts. The implementation of the dual extrapolation update motivated by our algorithmic framework shows promise on LLM pre-training benchmarks.

### 2. [Stable Matching with Deviators and Conformists](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18573v1)

Authors: Frederik Glitzner, David Manlove

In the fundamental Stable Marriage and Stable Roommates problems, there are inherent trade-offs between the size and stability of solutions. While in the former problem, a stable matching always exists and can be found efficiently using the celebrated Gale-Shapley algorithm, the existence of a stable matching is not guaranteed in the latter problem, but can be determined efficiently using Irving's algorithm. However, the computation of matchings that minimise the instability, either due to the presence of additional constraints on the size of the matching or due to restrictive preference cycles, gives rise to a collection of infamously intractable almost-stable matching problems. In practice, however, not every agent is able or likely to initiate deviations caused by blocking pairs. Suppose we knew, for example, due to a set of requirements or estimates based on historical data, which agents are likely to initiate deviations - the deviators - and which are likely to comply with whatever matching they are presented with - the conformists. Can we decide efficiently whether a matching exists in which no deviator is blocking, i.e., in which no deviator has an incentive to initiate a deviation? Furthermore, can we find matchings in which only a few deviators are blocking? We characterise the computational complexity of this question in bipartite and non-bipartite preference settings. Surprisingly, these problems prove computationally intractable in strong ways: for example, unlike in the classical setting, where every agent is considered a deviator, in this extension, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists where no deviator is blocking. On the positive side, we identify polynomial-time and fixed-parameter tractable cases, providing novel algorithmics for multi-agent systems where stability cannot be fully guaranteed.

### 3. [Sampling Sphere Packings with Continuum Glauber Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18748v1)

Authors: Aiya Kuchukova, Santosh Vempala, Daniel J. Zhang

We establish a spectral gap for Continuum Glauber dynamics on the hard sphere model assuming strong spatial mixing, thereby extending the range of parameters in which Continuum Glauber is provably rapidly mixing. To do this, we introduce continuous extensions of spectral independence and negative fields localization. Our techniques apply to general Gibbs point processes with finite-range repulsive pair potentials. As a corollary, we improve the threshold up to which packings of a fixed number of spheres can be sampled from a bounded domain.

### 1. [Analyzing Images of Blood Cells with Quantum Machine Learning Methods: Equilibrium Propagation and Variational Quantum Circuits to Detect Acute Myeloid Leukemia](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18710v1)

Authors: A. Bano, L. Liebovitch

This paper presents a feasibility study demonstrating that quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms achieve competitive performance on real-world medical imaging despite operating under severe constraints. We evaluate Equilibrium Propagation (EP), an energy-based learning method that does not use backpropagation (incompatible with quantum systems due to state-collapsing measurements) and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for automated detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) from blood cell microscopy images using binary classification (2 classes: AML vs. Healthy).
  Key Result: Using limited subsets (50-250 samples per class) of the AML-Cytomorphology dataset (18,365 expert-annotated images), quantum methods achieve performance only 12-15% below classical CNNs despite reduced image resolution (64x64 pixels), engineered features (20D), and classical simulation via Qiskit. EP reaches 86.4% accuracy (only 12% below CNN) without backpropagation, while the 4-qubit VQC attains 83.0% accuracy with consistent data efficiency: VQC maintains stable 83% performance with only 50 samples per class, whereas CNN requires 250 samples (5x more data) to reach 98%. These results establish reproducible baselines for QML in healthcare, validating NISQ-era feasibility.

Authors: Amanuel Anteneh, Kyungeun Kim, J. M. Schwarz, Israel Klich, Olivier Pfister

We present a method for implementing an optical neural network using only linear optical resources, namely field displacement and interferometry applied to coherent states of light. The nonlinearity required for learning in a neural network is realized via an encoding of the input into phase shifts allowing for far more straightforward experimental implementation compared to previous proposals for, and demonstrations of, $\textit{in situ}$ inference. Beyond $\textit{in situ}$ inference, the method enables $\textit{in situ}$ training by utilizing established techniques like parameter shift rules or physical backpropagation to extract gradients directly from measurements of the linear optical circuit. We also investigate the effect of photon losses and find the model to be very resilient to these.

### 3. [The Quantum Cliff: A Critical Proton Tunneling Threshold Determines Clinical Severity in RPE65-Mediated Retinal Disease](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18435v1)

Authors: Biraja Ghoshal

Predicting clinical severity from genotype remains a fundamental challenge in molecular medicine, particularly for enzymes whose function depends on sub-atomic-scale geometry. Mutations in the \textit{RPE65} isomerohydrolase cause Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and related retinal diseases; however, the kinetic mechanisms connecting sub-atomic-scale perturbations to blindness remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mutations in the human visual isomerase RPE65 are governed by a quantum-mechanical threshold effect arising from proton tunneling in the active site. We established a hybrid quantum-classical structure-to-phenotype pipeline combining AlphaFold structure prediction with \textit{ab initio} quantum simulation using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to analyze minimal proton-coupled electron transfer in the visual cycle. Our analysis reveals that many pathogenic mutations do not merely occlude the active site, but rather strongly reduce the quantum probability of proton tunneling. We observed a sharp non-linear effect, termed the "Quantum Cliff," where minute structural changes (below 0.1 Å) reduce the reaction rate by multiple orders of magnitude. Based on these findings, we introduce a dimensionless Relative Quantum Activity Score (RQAS) that isolates the geometry-controlled exponential sensitivity of the reaction rate and successfully distinguishes between mild and severe patient phenotypes. These results suggest that RPE65 operates near a quantum-critical point, where sub-Angstrom structural perturbations induce a catastrophic loss of function. Furthermore, our findings establish quantum tunneling as a predictive mechanistic link between atomic structure and clinical phenotype, proposing a general framework for quantum-structural disease modeling.

### 4. [From Access Control to Usage Control with User-Managed Access](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18761v1)

Authors: Wout Slabbinck, Wouter Termont, Ruben Dedecker, Beatriz Esteves

Recent data protection and data governance regulations have intensified the demand for interoperable, decentralized data ecosystems that can support not only access control but also legally-aligned governance over data use. Existing Web-based data storage platforms increasingly struggle to meet these regulatory and practical requirements, as their authorization mechanisms rely on tightly coupled, document-centric access control models that lack expressiveness for legal constraints and fail to separate data management from authorization concerns. In parallel, widely adopted authorization standards remain poorly aligned with decentralized, semantically rich usage-control scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces an architecture that replaces Solid's native access control mechanisms with a UMA authorization flow, enabling the enforcement of usage control policies expressed with the W3C ODRL standard. This article details the conceptual background motivating this approach, presents the proposed UMA-based architecture, and describes a prototype implementation that integrates an ODRL-enabled Authorization Server with a Solid-compatible Resource Server. The prototype demonstrates that decoupling authorization from storage enables more flexible, interoperable, and legally expressive control over data use, while remaining compatible with existing Solid infrastructure. It also highlights practical design choices required to evaluate ODRL policies in the absence of a fully standardized evaluation semantics. Moreover, this work shows how usage control can be operationalized using existing Web standards, offering a concrete path beyond permission-based access control toward policy-aware, legally informed data governance. Future research will focus on policy management interfaces, richer claim verification mechanisms, and techniques for communicating and enforcing obligations over time.

### 1. [Well-quasi-ordered classes of bounded clique-width](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18571v1)

Authors: Maël Dumas, Aliaume Lopez

We study classes of graphs with bounded clique-width that are well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation, in the presence of labels on the vertices. We prove that, given a finite presentation of a class of graphs, one can decide whether the class is labelled-well-quasi-ordered. This solves an open problem raised by Daligault, Rao and Thomassé in 2010, and answers positively to two conjectures of Pouzet in the restricted case of bounded clique-width classes. Namely, we prove that being labelled-well-quasi-ordered by a set of size 2 or by a well-quasi-ordered infinite set are equivalent conditions, and that in such cases, one can freely assume that the graphs are equipped with a total ordering on their vertices. Finally, we provide a structural characterization of those classes as those that are of bounded clique-width and do not existentially transduce the class of all finite paths.

### 2. [Algebraic Characterizations of Classes of Regular Languages in DynFO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18429v1)

Authors: Corentin Barloy, Felix Tschirbs, Nils Vortmeier, Thomas Zeume

This paper explores the fine-grained structure of classes of regular languages maintainable in fragments of first-order logic within the dynamic descriptive complexity framework of Patnaik and Immerman. A result by Hesse states that the class of regular languages is maintainable by first-order formulas even if only unary auxiliary relations can be used. Another result by Gelade, Marquardt,and Schwentick states that the class of regular languages coincides with the class of languages maintainable by quantifier-free formulas with binary auxiliary relations. We refine Hesse's result and show that with unary auxiliary data formulas with one quantifier alternation can maintain all regular languages. We then obtain precise algebraic characterizations of the classes of languages maintainable with quantifier-free formulas and positive existential formulas in the presence of unary auxiliary relations.

### 3. [Adversarial Synchronization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18362v1)

Authors: Anton E. Lipin, Mikhail V. Volkov

We study a variant of the synchronization game on finite deterministic automata. In this game, Alice chooses one input letter of an automaton $A$ on each of her moves while Bob may respond with an arbitrary finite word over the input alphabet of $A$; Alice wins if the word obtained by interleaving her letters with Bob's responses resets $A$. We prove that if Alice has a winning strategy in this game on $A$, then $A$ admits a reset word whose length is strictly smaller than the number of states of $A$. In contrast, for any $k\ge 1$, we exhibit automata with shortest reset-word length quadratic in the number of states, on which Alice nevertheless wins a version of the game in which Bob's responses are restricted to arbitrary words of length at most $k$. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for deciding the winner in various synchronization games, and we analyze the relationships between variants of synchronization games on fixed-size automata.

### 1. [PPISP: Physically-Plausible Compensation and Control of Photometric Variations in Radiance Field Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18336v1)

Authors: Isaac Deutsch, Nicolas Moënne-Loccoz, Gavriel State, Zan Gojcic

Multi-view 3D reconstruction methods remain highly sensitive to photometric inconsistencies arising from camera optical characteristics and variations in image signal processing (ISP). Existing mitigation strategies such as per-frame latent variables or affine color corrections lack physical grounding and generalize poorly to novel views. We propose the Physically-Plausible ISP (PPISP) correction module, which disentangles camera-intrinsic and capture-dependent effects through physically based and interpretable transformations. A dedicated PPISP controller, trained on the input views, predicts ISP parameters for novel viewpoints, analogous to auto exposure and auto white balance in real cameras. This design enables realistic and fair evaluation on novel views without access to ground-truth images. PPISP achieves SoTA performance on standard benchmarks, while providing intuitive control and supporting the integration of metadata when available.

Authors: Xinhui Liu, Can Wang, Lei Liu, Zhenghao Chen, Wei Jiang, Wei Wang, Dong Xu

Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) reconstruction enables photorealistic and interactive 3D scene visualization; however, real-time streaming is often bottlenecked by sparse-view inputs, prohibitive training costs, and bandwidth constraints. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced FVV due to its superior rendering speed, Streaming Free-Viewpoint Video (SFVV) introduces additional demands for rapid optimization, high-fidelity reconstruction under sparse constraints, and minimal storage footprints. To bridge this gap, we propose StreamLoD-GS, an LoD-based Gaussian Splatting framework designed specifically for SFVV. Our approach integrates three core innovations: 1) an Anchor- and Octree-based LoD-structured 3DGS with a hierarchical Gaussian dropout technique to ensure efficient and stable optimization while maintaining high-quality rendering; 2) a GMM-based motion partitioning mechanism that separates dynamic and static content, refining dynamic regions while preserving background stability; and 3) a quantized residual refinement framework that significantly reduces storage requirements without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StreamLoD-GS achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality, efficiency, and storage.

### 3. [GimmBO: Interactive Generative Image Model Merging via Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18585v1)

Authors: Chenxi Liu, Selena Ling, Alec Jacobson

Fine-tuning-based adaptation is widely used to customize diffusion-based image generation, leading to large collections of community-created adapters that capture diverse subjects and styles. Adapters derived from the same base model can be merged with weights, enabling the synthesis of new visual results within a vast and continuous design space. To explore this space, current workflows rely on manual slider-based tuning, an approach that scales poorly and makes weight selection difficult, even when the candidate set is limited to 20-30 adapters. We propose GimmBO to support interactive exploration of adapter merging for image generation through Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO). Motivated by observations from real-world usage, including sparsity and constrained weight ranges, we introduce a two-stage BO backend that improves sampling efficiency and convergence in high-dimensional spaces. We evaluate our approach with simulated users and a user study, demonstrating improved convergence, high success rates, and consistent gains over BO and line-search baselines, and further show the flexibility of the framework through several extensions.

Authors: Filip Nikolow, Piotr Faliszewski, Stanisław Szufa

We form a "map of tournaments" by adapting the map framework from the world of elections. By a tournament we mean a complete directed graph where the nodes are the players and an edge points from a winner of a game to the loser (with no ties allowed). A map is a set of tournaments represented as points on a 2D plane, so that their Euclidean distances resemble the distances computed according to a given measure. We identify useful distance measures, discuss ways of generating random tournaments (and compare them to several real-life ones), and show how the maps are helpful in visualizing experimental results (also for knockout tournaments).

Authors: Léonard Brice, Thomas A. Henzinger, K. S. Thejaswini

Consider a 4-player version of Matching Pennies where a team of three players competes against the Devil. Each player simultaneously says "Heads" or "Tails". The team wins if all four choices match; otherwise the Devil wins. If all team players randomise independently, they win with probability 1/8; if all players share a common source of randomness, they win with probability 1/2. What happens when each pair of team players shares a source of randomness? Can the team do better than win with probability 1/4? The surprising (and nontrivial) answer is yes! We introduce Dicey Games, a formal framework motivated by the study of distributed systems with shared sources of randomness (of which the above example is a specific instance). We characterise the existence, representation and computational complexity of optimal strategies in Dicey Games, and we study the problem of allocating limited sources of randomness optimally within a team.

Authors: Piotr Faliszewski, Łukasz Janeczko, Andrzej Kaczmarczyk, Marcin Kurdziel, Grzegorz Pierczyński, Stanisław Szufa

We study the independent approval model (IAM) for approval elections, where each candidate has its own approval probability and is approved independently of the other ones. This model generalizes, e.g., the impartial culture, the Hamming noise model, and the resampling model. We propose algorithms for learning IAMs and their mixtures from data, using either maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian learning. We then apply these algorithms to a large set of elections from the Pabulib database. In particular, we find that single-component models are rarely sufficient to capture the complexity of real-life data, whereas their mixtures perform well.

Authors: Boxiao Chen, Jiashuo Jiang, Stefanus Jasin

Decentralized decision making in multi--product firms can lead to efficiency losses when autonomous decision makers fail to internalize cross--product demand interactions. This paper quantifies the magnitude of such losses by analyzing the Price of Anarchy in a pricing game in which each decision maker independently sets prices to maximize its own product--level revenue. We model demand using a linear system that captures both substitution and complementarity effects across products. We first establish existence and uniqueness of a pure--strategy Nash equilibrium under economically standard diagonal dominance conditions. Our main contribution is the derivation of a tight worst--case lower bound on the ratio between decentralized revenue and the optimal centralized revenue. We show that this efficiency loss is governed by a single scalar parameter, denoted by $μ$, which measures the aggregate strength of cross--price effects relative to own--price sensitivities. In particular, we prove that the revenue ratio is bounded below by $4(1-μ)/(2-μ)^2$, and we demonstrate the tightness of this bound by constructing a symmetric market topology in which the bound is exactly attained. We further refine the analysis by providing an instance--exact characterization of efficiency loss based on the spectral properties of the demand interaction matrix. Together, these results offer a quantitative framework for assessing the trade--off between centralized pricing and decentralized autonomy in multi--product firms.

Authors: Junling Wang, Hongyi Lan, Xiaotian Su, Mustafa Doga Dogan, April Yi Wang

Designing user interfaces (UIs) is a critical step when launching products, building portfolios, or personalizing projects, yet end users without design expertise often struggle to articulate their intent and to trust design choices. Existing example-based tools either promote broad exploration, which can cause overwhelm and design drift, or require adapting a single example, risking design fixation. We present UI Remix, an interactive system that supports mobile UI design through an example-driven design workflow. Powered by a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MMRAG) model, UI Remix enables iterative search, selection, and adaptation of examples at both the global (whole interface) and local (component) level. To foster trust, it presents source transparency cues such as ratings, download counts, and developer information. In an empirical study with 24 end users, UI Remix significantly improved participants' ability to achieve their design goals, facilitated effective iteration, and encouraged exploration of alternative designs. Participants also reported that source transparency cues enhanced their confidence in adapting examples. Our findings suggest new directions for AI-assisted, example-driven systems that empower end users to design with greater control, trust, and openness to exploration.

Authors: Haiyi Li, Yiyang Zhao, Yutong Li, Alison Deslandes, Jodie Avery, Mary Louise Hull, Hsiang-Ting Chen

Endometriosis ultrasound reports are often unstructured free-text documents that require manual abstraction for downstream tasks such as analytics, machine learning model training, and clinical auditing. We present \textbf{EndoExtract}, an on-premise LLM-powered system that extracts structured data from these reports and surfaces interpretive fields for human review. Through contextual inquiry with research assistants, we identified key workflow pain points: asymmetric trust between numerical and interpretive fields, repetitive manual highlighting, fatigue from sustained comparison, and terminology inconsistency across radiologists. These findings informed an interface that surfaces only interpretive fields for mandatory review, automatically highlights source evidence within PDFs, and separates batch extraction from human-paced verification. A formative workshop revealed that \textbf{EndoExtract} supports a shift from field-by-field data entry to supervisory validation, though participants noted risks of over-skimming and challenges in managing missing data.

Authors: Nan Chen, Jing Lu, Zilong Wang, Luna K. Qiu, Siming Chen, Yuqing Yang

Equal access to digital technologies is critical for education, employment, and social participation. However, mainstream interfaces are visually oriented, creating steep learning curves and frequent obstacles for screen reader users, and limiting their independence and opportunities. Existing support is inadequate -- tutorials mainly target sighted users, while human assistance lacks real-time availability. We introduce AskEase, an on-demand AI assistant that provides step-by-step, screen reader user-friendly guidance for computer use. AskEase manages multiple sources of context to infer user intent and deliver precise, situation-specific guidance. Its seamless interaction design minimizes disruption and reduces the effort of seeking help. We demonstrated its effectiveness through representative usage scenarios and robustness tests. In a within-subjects study with 12 screen reader users, AskEase significantly improved task success while reducing perceived workload, including physical demand, effort, and frustration. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-powered assistants to promote accessible computing and expand opportunities for users with visual impairments.

Authors: Jiayi Zhou, Liwenhan Xie, Jiaju Ma, Zheng Wei, Huamin Qu, Anyi Rao

Digital collage is an artistic practice that combines image cutouts to tell stories. However, preparing cutouts from a set of photos remains a tedious and time-consuming task. A formative study identified three main challenges: 1) inefficient search for relevant photos, 2) manual image cutout, and 3) difficulty in organizing large sets of cutouts. To meet these challenges and facilitate asset preparation for collage, we propose Collaposer, a tool that transforms a collection of photos into organized, ready-to-use visual cutouts based on user-provided story descriptions. Collaposer tags, detects, and segments photos, and then uses an LLM to select central and related labels based on the user-provided story description. Collaposer presents the resulting visuals in varying sizes, clustered according to semantic hierarchy. Our evaluation shows that Collaposer effectively automates the preparation process to produce diverse sets of visual cutouts adhering to the storyline, allowing users to focus on collaging these assets for storytelling.

Authors: Sizhe Cheng, Songheng Zhang, Dong Ma, Yong Wang

With the prevalence of mobile data visualizations, there have been growing concerns about their privacy risks, especially shoulder surfing attacks. Inspired by prior research on visual illusion, we propose BAIT, a novel approach to automatically generate privacy-preserving visualizations by stacking a decoy visualization over a given visualization. It allows visualization owners at proximity to clearly discern the original visualization and makes shoulder surfers at a distance be misled by the decoy visualization, by adjusting different visual channels of a decoy visualization (e.g., shape, position, tilt, size, color and spatial frequency). We explicitly model human perception effect at different viewing distances to optimize the decoy visualization design. Privacy-preserving examples and two in-depth user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of BAIT in both controlled lab study and real-world scenarios.

Authors: Meziah Ruby Cristobal, Hyeonjeong Byeon, Tze-Yu Chen, Ruoxi Shang, Donghoon Shin, Ruican Zhong, Tony Zhou, Gary Hsieh

The dissemination of scholarly research is critical, yet researchers often lack the time and skills to create engaging content for popular media such as short-form videos. To address this gap, we explore the use of generative AI to help researchers transform their academic papers into accessible video content. Informed by a formative study with science communicators and content creators (N=8), we designed PaperTok, an end-to-end system that automates the initial creative labor by generating script options and corresponding audiovisual content from a source paper. Researchers can then refine based on their preferences with further prompting. A mixed-methods user study (N=18) and crowdsourced evaluation (N=100) demonstrate that PaperTok's workflow can help researchers create engaging and informative short-form videos. We also identified the need for more fine-grained controls in the creation process. To this end, we offer implications for future generative tools that support science outreach.

Authors: Shiwei Wu, Ziyao Gao, Zhendong He, Zongtan He, Zhupeng Huang, Xia Chen, Wei Zeng, Xiaojuan Ma, Zhenhui Peng

Visual designers often seek inspiration from Chinese paintings when tasked with creating Chinese-style illustrations, posters, etc. Our formative study (N=10) reveals that during ideation, designers learn the cultural symbols, emotions, compositions, and styles in Chinese paintings but face challenges in searching, analyzing, and integrating these dimensions. This paper leverages multi-modal large models to annotate the value of each dimension in 16,315 Chinese paintings, built on which we propose InkIdeator, an ideation support system for Chinese-style visual designs. InkIdeator suggests cultural symbols associated with the task theme, provides dimensional keywords to help analyze Chinese paintings, and generates visual examples integrating user-selected keywords. Our within-subjects study (N=12) using a baseline system without extracted dimensional keywords, along with two extended use cases by Chinese painters, indicates InkIdeator's effectiveness in creative ideation support, helping users efficiently explore cultural dimensions in Chinese paintings and visualize their ideas. We discuss implications for supporting culture-related visual design ideation with generative AI.

Authors: Brian Liu, Oiwi Parker Jones

Decoding emotion from brain activity could unlock a deeper understanding of the human experience. While a number of existing datasets align brain data with speech and with speech transcripts, no datasets have annotated brain data with sentiment. To bridge this gap, we explore the use of pre-trained Text-to-Sentiment models to annotate non invasive brain recordings, acquired using magnetoencephalography (MEG), while participants listened to audiobooks. Having annotated the text, we employ force-alignment of the text and audio to align our sentiment labels with the brain recordings. It is straightforward then to train Brainto-Sentiment models on these data. Experimental results show an improvement in balanced accuracy for Brain-to-Sentiment compared to baseline, supporting the proposed approach as a proof-of-concept for leveraging existing MEG datasets and learning to decode sentiment directly from the brain.

Authors: Onyedikachi Hope Amaechi-Okorie, Branislav Radeljic

Speech remains one of the most visible yet overlooked vectors of inclusion and exclusion in contemporary society. While fluency is often equated with credibility and competence, individuals with atypical speech patterns are routinely marginalized. Given the current state of the debate, this article focuses on the structural biases that shape perceptions of atypical speech and are now being encoded into artificial intelligence. Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems and voice interfaces, trained predominantly on standardized speech, routinely fail to recognize or respond to diverse voices, compounding digital exclusion. As AI technologies increasingly mediate access to opportunity, the study calls for inclusive technological design, anti-bias training to minimize the impact of discriminatory algorithmic decisions, and enforceable policy reform that explicitly recognize speech diversity as a matter of equity, not merely accessibility. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, the article advocates for a cultural and institutional shift in how we value voice, urging co-created solutions that elevate the rights, representation, and realities of atypical speakers in the digital age. Ultimately, the article reframes speech inclusion as a matter of equity (not accommodation) and advocates for co-created AI systems that reflect the full spectrum of human voices.

### 10. [Lip-Siri: Contactless Open-Sentence Silent Speech with Wi-Fi Backscatter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18177v1)

Authors: Ye Tian, Haohua Du, Chao Gu, Junyang Zhang, Shanyue Wang, Hao Zhou, Jiahui Hou, Xiang-Yang Li

Silent speech interfaces (SSIs) enable silent interaction in noise-sensitive or privacy-sensitive settings. However, existing SSIs face practical deployment trade-offs among privacy, user experience, and energy consumption, and most remain limited to closed-set recognition over small, pre-defined vocabularies of words or sentences, which restricts real-world expressiveness. In this paper, we present Lip-Siri, to the best of our knowledge, the first Wi-Fi backscatter--based SSI that supports open-vocabulary sentence recognition via lexicon-guided subword decoding. Lip-Siri designs a frequency-shifted backscatter tag to isolate tag-modulated reflections and suppress interference from non-target motions, enabling reliable extraction of lip-motion traces from ubiquitous Wi-Fi signals. We then segment continuous traces into lip-motion units, cluster them, learn robust unit representations via cluster-based self-supervision, and finally propose a lexicon-guided Transformer encoder--decoder with beam search to decode variable-length sentence sequences. We implement an end-to-end prototype and evaluate it with 15 participants on 340 sentences and 3,398 words across multiple scenarios. Lip-Siri achieves 85.61% accuracy on word prediction and a WER of 36.87% on continuous sentence recognition, approaching the performance of representative vision-based lip-reading systems.

### Information Retrieval

### 1. [Feature-Indexed Federated Recommendation with Residual-Quantized Codebooks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18570v1)

Authors: Mingzhe Han, Jiahao Liu, Dongsheng Li, Hansu Gu, Peng Zhang, Ning Gu, Tun Lu

Federated recommendation provides a privacy-preserving solution for training recommender systems without centralizing user interactions. However, existing methods follow an ID-indexed communication paradigm that transmit whole item embeddings between clients and the server, which has three major limitations: 1) consumes uncontrollable communication resources, 2) the uploaded item information cannot generalize to related non-interacted items, and 3) is sensitive to client noisy feedback. To solve these problems, it is necessary to fundamentally change the existing ID-indexed communication paradigm. Therefore, we propose a feature-indexed communication paradigm that transmits feature code embeddings as codebooks rather than raw item embeddings. Building on this paradigm, we present RQFedRec, which assigns each item a list of discrete code IDs via Residual Quantization (RQ)-Kmeans. Each client generates and trains code embeddings as codebooks based on discrete code IDs provided by the server, and the server collects and aggregates these codebooks rather than item embeddings. This design makes communication controllable since the codebooks could cover all items, enabling updates to propagate across related items in same code ID. In addition, since code embedding represents many items, which is more robust to a single noisy item. To jointly capture semantic and collaborative information, RQFedRec further adopts a collaborative-semantic dual-channel aggregation with a curriculum strategy that emphasizes semantic codes early and gradually increases the contribution of collaborative codes over training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that RQFedRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art federated recommendation baselines while significantly reducing communication overhead.

### 2. [Generative Chain of Behavior for User Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18213v1)

Authors: Chengkai Huang, Xiaodi Chen, Hongtao Huang, Quan Z. Sheng, Lina Yao

Modeling long-term user behavior trajectories is essential for understanding evolving preferences and enabling proactive recommendations. However, most sequential recommenders focus on next-item prediction, overlooking dependencies across multiple future actions. We propose Generative Chain of Behavior (GCB), a generative framework that models user interactions as an autoregressive chain of semantic behaviors over multiple future steps. GCB first encodes items into semantic IDs via RQ-VAE with k-means refinement, forming a discrete latent space that preserves semantic proximity. On top of this space, a transformer-based autoregressive generator predicts multi-step future behaviors conditioned on user history, capturing long-horizon intent transitions and generating coherent trajectories. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that GCB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommenders in multi-step accuracy and trajectory consistency. Beyond these gains, GCB offers a unified generative formulation for capturing user preference evolution.

### 3. [Enhancing LLM-based Recommendation with Preference Hint Discovery from Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18096v1)

Authors: Yuting Zhang, Ziliang Pei, Chao Wang, Ying Sun, Fuzhen Zhuang

LLMs have garnered substantial attention in recommendation systems. Yet they fall short of traditional recommenders when capturing complex preference patterns. Recent works have tried integrating traditional recommendation embeddings into LLMs to resolve this issue, yet a core gap persists between their continuous embedding and discrete semantic spaces. Intuitively, textual attributes derived from interactions can serve as critical preference rationales for LLMs' recommendation logic. However, directly inputting such attribute knowledge presents two core challenges: (1) Deficiency of sparse interactions in reflecting preference hints for unseen items; (2) Substantial noise introduction from treating all attributes as hints. To this end, we propose a preference hint discovery model based on the interaction-integrated knowledge graph, enhancing LLM-based recommendation. It utilizes traditional recommendation principles to selectively extract crucial attributes as hints. Specifically, we design a collaborative preference hint extraction schema, which utilizes semantic knowledge from similar users' explicit interactions as hints for unseen items. Furthermore, we develop an instance-wise dual-attention mechanism to quantify the preference credibility of candidate attributes, identifying hints specific to each unseen item. Using these item- and user-based hints, we adopt a flattened hint organization method to shorten input length and feed the textual hint information to the LLM for commonsense reasoning. Extensive experiments on both pair-wise and list-wise recommendation tasks verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework, indicating an average relative improvement of over 3.02% against baselines.

### 4. [Token-level Collaborative Alignment for LLM-based Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18457v1)

Authors: Fake Lin, Binbin Hu, Zhi Zheng, Xi Zhu, Ziqi Liu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Tong Xu

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for generative recommendation by leveraging rich semantic knowledge. However, existing LLM-based recommender systems struggle to effectively incorporate collaborative filtering (CF) signals, due to a fundamental mismatch between item-level preference modeling in CF and token-level next-token prediction (NTP) optimization in LLMs. Prior approaches typically treat CF as contextual hints or representation bias, and resort to multi-stage training to reduce behavioral semantic space discrepancies, leaving CF unable to explicitly regulate LLM generation. In this work, we propose Token-level Collaborative Alignment for Recommendation (TCA4Rec), a model-agnostic and plug-and-play framework that establishes an explicit optimization-level interface between CF supervision and LLM generation. TCA4Rec consists of (i) Collaborative Tokenizer, which projects raw item-level CF logits into token-level distributions aligned with the LLM token space, and (ii) Soft Label Alignment, which integrates these CF-informed distributions with one-hot supervision to optimize a soft NTP objective. This design preserves the generative nature of LLM training while enabling collaborative alignment with essential user preference of CF models. We highlight TCA4Rec is compatible with arbitrary traditional CF models and generalizes across a wide range of decoder-based LLM recommender architectures. Moreover, it provides an explicit mechanism to balance behavioral alignment and semantic fluency, yielding generative recommendations that are both accurate and controllable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA4Rec consistently improves recommendation performance across a broad spectrum of CF models and LLM-based recommender systems.

### 5. [Dep-Search: Learning Dependency-Aware Reasoning Traces with Persistent Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18771v1)

Authors: Yanming Liu, Xinyue Peng, Zixuan Yan, Yanxin Shen, Wenjie Xu, Yuefeng Huang, Xinyi Wang, Jiannan Cao, Jianwei Yin, Xuhong Zhang

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, particularly when augmented with search mechanisms that enable systematic exploration of external knowledge bases. The field has evolved from traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks to more sophisticated search-based frameworks that orchestrate multi-step reasoning through explicit search strategies. However, existing search frameworks still rely heavily on implicit natural language reasoning to determine search strategies and how to leverage retrieved information across reasoning steps. This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO. Dep-Search introduces explicit control mechanisms that enable the model to decompose questions with dependency relationships, retrieve information when needed, access previously stored knowledge from memory, and summarize long reasoning contexts into reusable memory entries. Through extensive experiments on seven diverse question answering datasets, we demonstrate that Dep-Search significantly enhances LLMs' ability to tackle complex multi-hop reasoning tasks, achieving substantial improvements over strong baselines across different model scales.

### 6. [GenCI: Generative Modeling of User Interest Shift via Cohort-based Intent Learning for CTR Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18251v1)

Authors: Kesha Ou, Zhen Tian, Wayne Xin Zhao, Hongyu Lu, Ji-Rong Wen

Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays a pivotal role in online advertising and recommender systems. Despite notable progress in modeling user preferences from historical behaviors, two key challenges persist. First, exsiting discriminative paradigms focus on matching candidates to user history, often overfitting to historically dominant features and failing to adapt to rapid interest shifts. Second, a critical information chasm emerges from the point-wise ranking paradigm. By scoring each candidate in isolation, CTR models discard the rich contextual signal implied by the recalled set as a whole, leading to a misalignment where long-term preferences often override the user's immediate, evolving intent. To address these issues, we propose GenCI, a generative user intent framework that leverages semantic interest cohorts to model dynamic user preferences for CTR prediction. The framework first employs a generative model, trained with a next-item prediction (NTP) objective, to proactively produce candidate interest cohorts. These cohorts serve as explicit, candidate-agnostic representations of a user's immediate intent. A hierarchical candidate-aware network then injects this rich contextual signal into the ranking stage, refining them with cross-attention to align with both user history and the target item. The entire model is trained end-to-end, creating a more aligned and effective CTR prediction pipeline. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Authors: James Burgess, Jan N. Hansen, Duo Peng, Yuhui Zhang, Alejandro Lozano, Min Woo Sun, Emma Lundberg, Serena Yeung-Levy

Search agents are language models (LMs) that reason and search knowledge bases (or the web) to answer questions; recent methods supervise only the final answer accuracy using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Most RLVR search agents tackle general-domain QA, which limits their relevance to technical AI systems in science, engineering, and medicine. In this work we propose training agents to search and reason over scientific papers -- this tests technical question-answering, it is directly relevant to real scientists, and the capabilities will be crucial to future AI Scientist systems. Concretely, we release a search corpus of 16 million biomedical paper abstracts and construct a challenging factoid QA dataset called PaperSearchQA with 60k samples answerable from the corpus, along with benchmarks. We train search agents in this environment to outperform non-RL retrieval baselines; we also perform further quantitative analysis and observe interesting agent behaviors like planning, reasoning, and self-verification. Our corpus, datasets, and benchmarks are usable with the popular Search-R1 codebase for RLVR training and released on https://huggingface.co/collections/jmhb/papersearchqa. Finally, our data creation methods are scalable and easily extendable to other scientific domains.

### 8. [DMAP: Human-Aligned Structural Document Map for Multimodal Document Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18203v1)

Authors: ShunLiang Fu, Yanxin Zhang, Yixin Xiang, Xiaoyu Du, Jinhui Tang

Existing multimodal document question-answering (QA) systems predominantly rely on flat semantic retrieval, representing documents as a set of disconnected text chunks and largely neglecting their intrinsic hierarchical and relational structures. Such flattening disrupts logical and spatial dependencies - such as section organization, figure-text correspondence, and cross-reference relations, that humans naturally exploit for comprehension. To address this limitation, we introduce a document-level structural Document MAP (DMAP), which explicitly encodes both hierarchical organization and inter-element relationships within multimodal documents. Specifically, we design a Structured-Semantic Understanding Agent to construct DMAP by organizing textual content together with figures, tables, charts, etc. into a human-aligned hierarchical schema that captures both semantic and layout dependencies. Building upon this representation, a Reflective Reasoning Agent performs structure-aware and evidence-driven reasoning, dynamically assessing the sufficiency of retrieved context and iteratively refining answers through targeted interactions with DMAP. Extensive experiments on MMDocQA benchmarks demonstrate that DMAP yields document-specific structural representations aligned with human interpretive patterns, substantially enhancing retrieval precision, reasoning consistency, and multimodal comprehension over conventional RAG-based approaches.

### 9. [S$^2$GR: Stepwise Semantic-Guided Reasoning in Latent Space for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18664v1)

Authors: Zihao Guo, Jian Wang, Ruxin Zhou, Youhua Liu, Jiawei Guo, Jun Zhao, Xiaoxiao Xu, Yongqi Liu, Kaiqiao Zhan

Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a transformative paradigm with its end-to-end generation advantages. However, existing GR methods primarily focus on direct Semantic ID (SID) generation from interaction sequences, failing to activate deeper reasoning capabilities analogous to those in large language models and thus limiting performance potential. We identify two critical limitations in current reasoning-enhanced GR approaches: (1) Strict sequential separation between reasoning and generation steps creates imbalanced computational focus across hierarchical SID codes, degrading quality for SID codes; (2) Generated reasoning vectors lack interpretable semantics, while reasoning paths suffer from unverifiable supervision. In this paper, we propose stepwise semantic-guided reasoning in latent space (S$^2$GR), a novel reasoning enhanced GR framework. First, we establish a robust semantic foundation via codebook optimization, integrating item co-occurrence relationship to capture behavioral patterns, and load balancing and uniformity objectives that maximize codebook utilization while reinforcing coarse-to-fine semantic hierarchies. Our core innovation introduces the stepwise reasoning mechanism inserting thinking tokens before each SID generation step, where each token explicitly represents coarse-grained semantics supervised via contrastive learning against ground-truth codebook cluster distributions ensuring physically grounded reasoning paths and balanced computational focus across all SID codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$GR, and online A/B test confirms efficacy on large-scale industrial short video platform.

### 10. [Corpus-Based Approaches to Igbo Diacritic Restoration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18380v1)

Authors: Ignatius Ezeani

With natural language processing (NLP), researchers aim to enable computers to identify and understand patterns in human languages. This is often difficult because a language embeds many dynamic and varied properties in its syntax, pragmatics and phonology, which need to be captured and processed. The capacity of computers to process natural languages is increasing because NLP researchers are pushing its boundaries. But these research works focus more on well-resourced languages such as English, Japanese, German, French, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, etc. Over 95% of the world's 7000 languages are low-resourced for NLP, i.e. they have little or no data, tools, and techniques for NLP work.
  In this thesis, we present an overview of diacritic ambiguity and a review of previous diacritic disambiguation approaches on other languages. Focusing on the Igbo language, we report the steps taken to develop a flexible framework for generating datasets for diacritic restoration. Three main approaches, the standard n-gram model, the classification models and the embedding models were proposed. The standard n-gram models use a sequence of previous words to the target stripped word as key predictors of the correct variants. For the classification models, a window of words on both sides of the target stripped word was used. The embedding models compare the similarity scores of the combined context word embeddings and the embeddings of each of the candidate variant vectors.

### 1. [POPE: Learning to Reason on Hard Problems via Privileged On-Policy Exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18779v1)

Authors: Yuxiao Qu, Amrith Setlur, Virginia Smith, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Aviral Kumar

Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet state-of-the-art methods still fail to learn on many training problems. On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks.

Authors: Judith Vilella-Cantos, Mauro Martini, Marcello Chiaberge, Mónica Ballesta, David Valiente

Localization in agricultural environments is challenging due to their unstructured nature and lack of distinctive landmarks. Although agricultural settings have been studied in the context of object classification and segmentation, the place recognition task for mobile robots is not trivial in the current state of the art. In this study, we propose MinkUNeXt-VINE, a lightweight, deep-learning-based method that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in vineyard environments thanks to its pre-processing and Matryoshka Representation Learning multi-loss approach. Our method prioritizes enhanced performance with low-cost, sparse LiDAR inputs and lower-dimensionality outputs to ensure high efficiency in real-time scenarios. Additionally, we present a comprehensive ablation study of the results on various evaluation cases and two extensive long-term vineyard datasets employing different LiDAR sensors. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the trade-off output produced by this approach, as well as its robust performance on low-cost and low-resolution input data. The code is publicly available for reproduction.

Authors: A. Bano, L. Liebovitch

This paper presents a feasibility study demonstrating that quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms achieve competitive performance on real-world medical imaging despite operating under severe constraints. We evaluate Equilibrium Propagation (EP), an energy-based learning method that does not use backpropagation (incompatible with quantum systems due to state-collapsing measurements) and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for automated detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) from blood cell microscopy images using binary classification (2 classes: AML vs. Healthy).
  Key Result: Using limited subsets (50-250 samples per class) of the AML-Cytomorphology dataset (18,365 expert-annotated images), quantum methods achieve performance only 12-15% below classical CNNs despite reduced image resolution (64x64 pixels), engineered features (20D), and classical simulation via Qiskit. EP reaches 86.4% accuracy (only 12% below CNN) without backpropagation, while the 4-qubit VQC attains 83.0% accuracy with consistent data efficiency: VQC maintains stable 83% performance with only 50 samples per class, whereas CNN requires 250 samples (5x more data) to reach 98%. These results establish reproducible baselines for QML in healthcare, validating NISQ-era feasibility.

Authors: Yadang Alexis Rouzoumka, Jean Pinsolle, Eugénie Terreaux, Christèle Morisseau, Jean-Philippe Ovarlez, Chengfang Ren

We investigate the detection of weak complex-valued signals immersed in non-Gaussian, range-varying interference, with emphasis on maritime radar scenarios. The proposed methodology exploits a Complex-valued Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) trained exclusively on clutter-plus-noise to perform Out-Of-Distribution detection. By operating directly on in-phase / quadrature samples, the CVAE preserves phase and Doppler structure and is assessed in two configurations: (i) using unprocessed range profiles and (ii) after local whitening, where per-range covariance estimates are obtained from neighboring profiles. Using extensive simulations together with real sea-clutter data from the CSIR maritime dataset, we benchmark performance against classical and adaptive detectors (MF, NMF, AMF-SCM, ANMF-SCM, ANMF-Tyler). In both configurations, the CVAE yields a higher detection probability Pd at matched false-alarm rate Pfa, with the most notable improvements observed under whitening. We further integrate the CVAE with the ANMF through a weighted log-p fusion rule at the decision level, attaining enhanced robustness in strongly non-Gaussian clutter and enabling empirically calibrated Pfa control under H0. Overall, the results demonstrate that statistical normalization combined with complex-valued generative modeling substantively improves detection in realistic sea-clutter conditions, and that the fused CVAE-ANMF scheme constitutes a competitive alternative to established model-based detectors.

### 5. [A Dynamic Framework for Grid Adaptation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18672v1)

Authors: Spyros Rigas, Thanasis Papaioannou, Panagiotis Trakadas, Georgios Alexandridis

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently demonstrated promising potential in scientific machine learning, partly due to their capacity for grid adaptation during training. However, existing adaptation strategies rely solely on input data density, failing to account for the geometric complexity of the target function or metrics calculated during network training. In this work, we propose a generalized framework that treats knot allocation as a density estimation task governed by Importance Density Functions (IDFs), allowing training dynamics to determine grid resolution. We introduce a curvature-based adaptation strategy and evaluate it across synthetic function fitting, regression on a subset of the Feynman dataset and different instances of the Helmholtz PDE, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the standard input-based baseline. Specifically, our method yields average relative error reductions of 25.3% on synthetic functions, 9.4% on the Feynman dataset, and 23.3% on the PDE benchmark. Statistical significance is confirmed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, establishing curvature-based adaptation as a robust and computationally efficient alternative for KAN training.

Authors: Yingxiao Huo, Satya Prakash Dash, Radu Stoican, Samuel Kaski, Mingfei Sun

Natural gradients have long been studied in deep reinforcement learning due to their fast convergence properties and covariant weight updates. However, computing natural gradients requires inversion of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) at each iteration, which is computationally prohibitive in nature. In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable natural policy optimization technique that leverages a rank-1 approximation to full inverse-FIM. We theoretically show that under certain conditions, a rank-1 approximation to inverse-FIM converges faster than policy gradients and, under some conditions, enjoys the same sample complexity as stochastic policy gradient methods. We benchmark our method on a diverse set of environments and show that it achieves superior performance to standard actor-critic and trust-region baselines.

Authors: Panagiotis Lymperopoulos, Abhiramon Rajasekharan, Ian Berlot-Attwell, Stéphane Aroca-Ouellette, Kaheer Suleman

Building world models is essential for planning in real-world domains such as businesses. Since such domains have rich semantics, we can leverage world knowledge to effectively model complex action effects and causal relationships from limited data. In this work, we propose CASSANDRA, a neurosymbolic world modeling approach that leverages an LLM as a knowledge prior to construct lightweight transition models for planning. CASSANDRA integrates two components: (1) LLM-synthesized code to model deterministic features, and (2) LLM-guided structure learning of a probabilistic graphical model to capture causal relationships among stochastic variables. We evaluate CASSANDRA in (i) a small-scale coffee-shop simulator and (ii) a complex theme park business simulator, where we demonstrate significant improvements in transition prediction and planning over baselines.

### 8. [Geometry-Free Conditional Diffusion Modeling for Solving the Inverse Electrocardiography Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18615v1)

Authors: Ramiro Valdes Jara, Adam Meyers

This paper proposes a data-driven model for solving the inverse problem of electrocardiography, the mathematical problem that forms the basis of electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI). We present a conditional diffusion framework that learns a probabilistic mapping from noisy body surface signals to heart surface electric potentials. The proposed approach leverages the generative nature of diffusion models to capture the non-unique and underdetermined nature of the ECGI inverse problem, enabling probabilistic sampling of multiple reconstructions rather than a single deterministic estimate. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed framework is geometry-free and purely data-driven, alleviating the need for patient-specific mesh construction. We evaluate the method on a real ECGI dataset and compare it against strong deterministic baselines, including a convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and transformer-based model. The results demonstrate that the proposed diffusion approach achieves improved reconstruction accuracy, highlighting the potential of diffusion models as a robust tool for noninvasive cardiac electrophysiology imaging.

### 9. [What Do Learned Models Measure?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18278v1)

Authors: Indrė Žliobaitė

In many scientific and data-driven applications, machine learning models are increasingly used as measurement instruments, rather than merely as predictors of predefined labels. When the measurement function is learned from data, the mapping from observations to quantities is determined implicitly by the training distribution and inductive biases, allowing multiple inequivalent mappings to satisfy standard predictive evaluation criteria. We formalize learned measurement functions as a distinct focus of evaluation and introduce measurement stability, a property capturing invariance of the measured quantity across admissible realizations of the learning process and across contexts. We show that standard evaluation criteria in machine learning, including generalization error, calibration, and robustness, do not guarantee measurement stability. Through a real-world case study, we show that models with comparable predictive performance can implement systematically inequivalent measurement functions, with distribution shift providing a concrete illustration of this failure. Taken together, our results highlight a limitation of existing evaluation frameworks in settings where learned model outputs are identified as measurements, motivating the need for an additional evaluative dimension.

### 10. [Beyond Retention: Orchestrating Structural Safety and Plasticity in Continual Learning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18255v1)

Authors: Fei Meng

Continual learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) faces the critical challenge of balancing stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (learning new tasks). While Experience Replay (ER) is a standard countermeasure against catastrophic forgetting, its impact across diverse capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we uncover a critical dichotomy in ER's behavior: while it induces positive backward transfer on robust, unstructured tasks (e.g., boosting performance on previous NLP classification tasks through repeated rehearsal), it causes severe negative transfer on fragile, structured domains like code generation (e.g., a significant relative drop in coding accuracy). This reveals that ER trades structural integrity for broad consolidation. To address this dilemma, we propose \textbf{Orthogonal Subspace Wake-up (OSW)}. OSW identifies essential parameter subspaces of previous tasks via a brief "wake-up" phase and enforces orthogonal updates for new tasks, providing a mathematically grounded "safety guarantee" for established knowledge structures. Empirical results across a diverse four-task sequence demonstrate that OSW uniquely succeeds in preserving fragile coding abilities where Replay fails, while simultaneously maintaining high plasticity for novel tasks. Our findings emphasize the necessity of evaluating structural safety alongside average retention in LLM continual learning.

Authors: Sicheng Shen, Mingyang Lv, Bing Han, Dongcheng Zhao, Guobin Shen, Feifei Zhao, Yi Zeng

In recent years, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Spiking Transformers emerging as a promising architecture for energy-efficient sequence modeling. However, existing Spiking Transformers still lack a principled mechanism for effective temporal fusion, limiting their ability to fully exploit spatiotemporal dependencies. Inspired by feedforward-feedback modulation in the human visual pathway, we propose TEFormer, the first Spiking Transformer framework that achieves bidirectional temporal fusion by decoupling temporal modeling across its core components. Specifically, TEFormer employs a lightweight and hyperparameter-free forward temporal fusion mechanism in the attention module, enabling fully parallel computation, while incorporating a backward gated recurrent structure in the MLP to aggregate temporal information in reverse order and reinforce temporal consistency. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that TEFormer consistently and significantly outperforms strong SNN and Spiking Transformer baselines under diverse datasets. Moreover, through the first systematic evaluation of Spiking Transformers under different neural encoding schemes, we show that the performance gains of TEFormer remain stable across encoding choices, indicating that the improved temporal modeling directly translates into reliable accuracy improvements across varied spiking representations. These results collectively establish TEFormer as an effective and general framework for temporal modeling in Spiking Transformers.

Authors: Wei-Po Hsin, Ren-Hao Deng, Yao-Ting Hsieh, En-Ming Huang, Shih-Hao Hung

Verilog's design cycle is inherently labor-intensive and necessitates extensive domain expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising pathway toward automation, their limited training data and intrinsic sequential reasoning fail to capture the strict formal logic and concurrency inherent in hardware systems. To overcome these barriers, we present EvolVE, the first framework to analyze multiple evolution strategies on chip design tasks, revealing that Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) excels at maximizing functional correctness, while Idea-Guided Refinement (IGR) proves superior for optimization. We further leverage Structured Testbench Generation (STG) to accelerate the evolutionary process. To address the lack of complex optimization benchmarks, we introduce IC-RTL, targeting industry-scale problems derived from the National Integrated Circuit Contest. Evaluations establish EvolVE as the new state-of-the-art, achieving 98.1% on VerilogEval v2 and 92% on RTLLM v2. Furthermore, on the industry-scale IC-RTL suite, our framework surpasses reference implementations authored by contest participants, reducing the Power, Performance, Area (PPA) product by up to 66% in Huffman Coding and 17% in the geometric mean across all problems. The source code of the IC-RTL benchmark is available at https://github.com/weiber2002/ICRTL.

### 3. [SMART: Scalable Mesh-free Aerodynamic Simulations from Raw Geometries using a Transformer-based Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18707v1)

Authors: Jan Hagnberger, Mathias Niepert

Machine learning-based surrogate models have emerged as more efficient alternatives to numerical solvers for physical simulations over complex geometries, such as car bodies. Many existing models incorporate the simulation mesh as an additional input, thereby reducing prediction errors. However, generating a simulation mesh for new geometries is computationally costly. In contrast, mesh-free methods, which do not rely on the simulation mesh, typically incur higher errors. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce SMART, a neural surrogate model that predicts physical quantities at arbitrary query locations using only a point-cloud representation of the geometry, without requiring access to the simulation mesh. The geometry and simulation parameters are encoded into a shared latent space that captures both structural and parametric characteristics of the physical field. A physics decoder then attends to the encoder's intermediate latent representations to map spatial queries to physical quantities. Through this cross-layer interaction, the model jointly updates latent geometric features and the evolving physical field. Extensive experiments show that SMART is competitive with and often outperforms existing methods that rely on the simulation mesh as input, demonstrating its capabilities for industry-level simulations.

Authors: Xinmeng Yu, Tao Jiang, Ran Cheng, Yaochu Jin, Kay Chen Tan

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are increasingly implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs) to leverage parallel processing capabilities for enhanced efficiency. However, existing studies largely emphasize the raw speedup obtained by porting individual algorithms from CPUs to GPUs. Consequently, these studies offer limited insight into when and why GPU parallelism fundamentally benefits EAs. To address this gap, we investigate how GPU parallelism alters the behavior of EAs beyond simple acceleration metrics. We conduct a systematic empirical study of 16 representative EAs on 30 benchmark problems. Specifically, we compare CPU and GPU executions across a wide range of problem dimensionalities and population sizes. Our results reveal that the impact of GPU acceleration is highly heterogeneous and depends strongly on algorithmic structure. We further demonstrate that conventional fixed-budget evaluation based on the number of function evaluations (FEs) is inadequate for GPU execution. In contrast, fixed-time evaluation uncovers performance characteristics that are unobservable under small or practically constrained FE budgets, particularly for adaptive and exploration-oriented algorithms. Moreover, we identify distinct scaling regimes in which GPU parallelism is beneficial, saturates, or degrades as problem dimensionality and population size increase. Crucially, we show that large populations enabled by GPUs not only improve hardware utilization but also reveal algorithm-specific convergence and diversity dynamics that are difficult to observe under CPU-constrained settings. Consequently, our findings indicate that GPU parallelism is not strictly an implementation detail, but a pivotal factor that influences how EAs should be evaluated, compared, and designed for modern computing platforms.

### 5. [Resonant Sparse Geometry Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18064v1)

Authors: Hasi Hays

We introduce Resonant Sparse Geometry Networks (RSGN), a brain-inspired architecture with self-organizing sparse
  hierarchical input-dependent connectivity. Unlike Transformer architectures that employ dense attention mechanisms with
  O(n^2) computational complexity, RSGN embeds computational nodes in learned hyperbolic space where connection strength
  decays with geodesic distance, achieving dynamic sparsity that adapts to each input. The architecture operates on two
  distinct timescales: fast differentiable activation propagation optimized through gradient descent, and slow
  Hebbian-inspired structural learning for connectivity adaptation through local correlation rules. We provide rigorous
  mathematical analysis demonstrating that RSGN achieves O(n*k) computational complexity, where k << n represents the average
  active neighborhood size. Experimental evaluation on hierarchical classification and long-range dependency tasks
  demonstrates that RSGN achieves 96.5% accuracy on long-range dependency tasks while using approximately 15x fewer
  parameters than standard Transformers. On challenging hierarchical classification with 20 classes, RSGN achieves 23.8%
  accuracy (compared to 5% random baseline) with only 41,672 parameters, nearly 10x fewer than the Transformer baselines
  which require 403,348 parameters to achieve 30.1% accuracy. Our ablation studies confirm the contribution of each architectural
  component, with Hebbian learning providing consistent improvements. These results suggest that brain-inspired principles
  of sparse, geometrically-organized computation offer a promising direction toward more efficient and biologically plausible
  neural architectures.

Authors: Konstantin Sozykin, Nikita Rybin, Andrei Chertkov, Anh-Huy Phan, Ivan Oseledets, Alexander Shapeev, Ivan Novikov, Gleb Ryzhakov

The global optimization of atomic clusters represents a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry and materials science due to the exponential growth of local minima with system size (i.e., the curse of dimensionality). We introduce a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the low-rank structure of potential energy surfaces through Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations. This work establishes TT-decomposition as a powerful tool for molecular structure prediction and provides a general framework adaptable to a wide range of high-dimensional optimization problems in computational material science.

### 1. [An ISAC-ready Full-Duplex Backscatter Architecture for the mmWave IoT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18727v1)

Authors: Skanda Harisha, Jimmy G. D. Hester, Aline Eid

Achieving long-range, high-rate, concurrent two-way mmWave communication with power-constrained IoT devices is fundamental to scaling future ubiquitous sensing systems, yet the substantial power demands and high cost of mmWave hardware have long stood in the way of practical deployment. This paper presents the first mmWave full-duplex backscatter tag architecture, charting a genuinely low-cost path toward high-performance mmWave connectivity and localization for ISAC systems. The proposed tag operates at ranges beyond 45m on the uplink and beyond 200m on the downlink, delivering 20x the reach of state-of-the-art systems while being over 100x cheaper than existing mmWave backscatter platforms. Enabling this leap is a novel low-power regenerative amplifier that provides 30 dB of gain while consuming only 30 mW, paired with a regenerative rectifier that achieves state-of-the-art sensitivity down to -60 dBm. We integrate our circuits on a compact PCB and evaluate it across diverse uplink and downlink scenarios, where it achieves an downlink BER of $10^{-1}$ at 200 meters and a uplink BER of $10^{-2}$ at 45 meters, demonstrating resilient, high-quality communication even at extended ranges.

### 2. [An LLM-Agent-Based Framework for Age of Information Optimization in Heterogeneous Random Access Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18563v1)

Authors: Fang Liu, Erchao Zhu, Jiedan Tan, Jingwen Tong, Taotao Wang, Shengli Zhang

With the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and heterogeneous wireless networks, the Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a critical metric for evaluating the performance of real-time and personalized systems. While AoI-based random access is essential for next-generation applications such as the low-altitude economy and indoor service robots, existing strategies, ranging from rule-based protocols to learning-based methods, face critical challenges, including idealized model assumptions, slow convergence, and poor generalization. In this article, we propose Reflex-Core, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) agent-based framework for AoI-driven random access in heterogeneous networks. By devising an "Observe-Reflect-Decide-Execute" closed-loop mechanism, this framework integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enable optimal, autonomous access control. Based on the Reflex-Core framework, we develop a Reflexive Multiple Access (RMA) protocol and a priority-based RMA variant for intelligent access control under different heterogeneous network settings. Experimental results demonstrate that in the investigated scenarios, the RMA protocol achieves up to a 14.9% reduction in average AoI compared with existing baselines, while the priority-based version improves the convergence rate by approximately 20%.

### 3. [Validation of a Software-Defined 100-Gb/s RDMA Streaming Architecture for Ultrafast Optoacoustic and Ultrasound Imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18280v1)

Authors: Federico Villani, Christian Vogt, Luca Specht, Jero Schmid, Xiang Liu, Andrea Cossettini, Daniel Razansky, Luca Benini

Optoacoustic (OA) imaging has emerged as a powerful investigation tool, with demonstrated applicability in oncology, neuroscience, and cardiovascular biology. However, its clinical translation is limited with the existing OA systems, which often rely on bulky and expensive acquisition hardware mainly optimized for pulse-echo ultrasound (US) imaging. Despite the fact that OA imaging has different requirements for receive bandwidths and timing synchronization with external laser sources, there is a strong need for unified OA-US imaging platforms, as pulse-echo US remains the standard tool for visualizing soft tissues. To address these challenges, we propose a new data acquisition architecture for ultrafast OA and US imaging that fully covers the requirements for large channel counts, wide bandwidth, and software-defined operation. LtL combines state-of-the-art wideband analog front-ends, a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC integrating FPGA fabric with an Application Processing Unit, and a 100 GbE Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) backend enabling raw-data streaming at up to 95.6 Gb/s. The architecture avoids local buffers followed by burst transfers, which commonly constrain sustainable frame rate and recording intervals, thus achieving true continuous and sustained streaming of raw data. We validate the core elements of the LtL architecture using a 16-channel demonstration system built from commercial evaluation boards. We further verify the signal chain for up to 256-channel scalability, confirming the wide bandwidth capabilities to support state-of-the-art data transmission speeds.

### 4. [Integrating HAPS, LEO, and Terrestrial Networks: A Cost-Performance Study for IoT Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18361v1)

Authors: Jean Michel de Souza Sant'Ana, Felipe Augusto Tondo, Nurul Huda Mahmood, Aamir Mahmood

This work evaluates the potential of High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites as alternative or complementary systems to enhance Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. We first analyze the transmission erasure probability under different connectivity configurations, including only HAPS or LEO satellites, as well as hybrid architectures that integrate both aerial/spatial and terrestrial infrastructures. To make the analysis more realistic, we considered movement of LEO satellites regarding a fixed region, elevation angle between gateway and devices, and different fading models for terrestrial and non-terrestrial communication. We also analyze LR-FHSS (Long-Range Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) random access uplink technology as a potential use case for IoT connectivity, showing the scalability impact of the scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that HAPS can effectively complement sparse terrestrial networks and improve the performance of satellite-based systems in specific scenarios. Furthermore, considering the deployment and operational costs, respectively, CAPEX and OPEX, the economic analysis reveals that although HAPS exhibits higher costs, these remain within a comparable order of magnitude to LEO and terrestrial deployments. In addition, specific use cases, such as natural disasters, transform HAPS into a competitive technology for conventional infrastructures.

### 5. [CovertComBench: The First Domain-Specific Testbed for LLMs in Wireless Covert Communication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18315v1)

Authors: Zhaozhi Liu, Jiaxin Chen, Yuanai Xie, Yuna Jiang, Minrui Xu, Xiao Zhang, Pan Lai, Zan Zhou

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into wireless networks presents significant potential for automating system design. However, unlike conventional throughput maximization, Covert Communication (CC) requires optimizing transmission utility under strict detection-theoretic constraints, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence limits. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on general reasoning or standard communication tasks and do not adequately evaluate the ability of LLMs to satisfy these rigorous security constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CovertComBench, a unified benchmark designed to assess LLM capabilities across the CC pipeline, encompassing conceptual understanding (MCQs), optimization derivation (ODQs), and code generation (CGQs). Furthermore, we analyze the reliability of automated scoring within a detection-theoretic ``LLM-as-Judge'' framework. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art models reveal a significant performance discrepancy. While LLMs achieve high accuracy in conceptual identification (81%) and code implementation (83%), their performance in the higher-order mathematical derivations necessary for security guarantees ranges between 18% and 55%. This limitation indicates that current LLMs serve better as implementation assistants rather than autonomous solvers for security-constrained optimization. These findings suggest that future research should focus on external tool augmentation to build trustworthy wireless AI systems.

### 6. [Accelerating Update Broadcasts Over LoRaWAN Downlink via D2D Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18134v1)

Authors: Anshika Singh, Siddhartha S. Borkotoky

Broadcast distribution of updates (e.g., security patches, machine learning models) from a server to end devices (EDs) is a critical requirement in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we consider the problem of reliable over-the-air broadcast of updates in Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWANs). Existing broadcast techniques for LoRaWANs suffer from long delivery delays due to low data rates and duty-cycle constraints. We address this problem by proposing a device-level cooperative mechanism, in which updated EDs broadcast a few update fragments to accelerate delivery to their neighbors. We demonstrate large reductions in the delivery time compared to conventional methods. For instance, in a 400-node network spanning 1 km radius and operating at 1% duty-cycle, the proposed scheme reduces the time required to deliver a 10 kilobyte update to an ED at the network's edge from 42 hours to 45 minutes. The proposed solution thus provides a pathway toward improved security and efficient realization of edge intelligence in LoRaWAN IoT.

### 7. [Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for IoT Malware Detection under Data Scarcity and Drift](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18736v1)

Authors: Jake Lyon, Ehsan Saeedizade, Shamik Sengupta

The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in domains such as smart cities, transportation, and industrial systems has heightened the urgency of addressing their security vulnerabilities. IoT devices often operate under limited computational resources, lack robust physical safeguards, and are deployed in heterogeneous and dynamic networks, making them prime targets for cyberattacks and malware applications. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to automated malware detection and classification, but practical deployment requires models that are both effective and lightweight. The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of four supervised learning models (Random Forest, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron) for malware detection and classification using the IoT-23 dataset. We evaluate model performance in both binary and multiclass classification tasks, assess sensitivity to training data volume, and analyze temporal robustness to simulate deployment in evolving threat landscapes. Our results show that tree-based models achieve high accuracy and generalization, even with limited training data, while performance deteriorates over time as malware diversity increases. These findings underscore the importance of adaptive, resource-efficient ML models for securing IoT systems in real-world environments.

### 8. [On the Bandwidth Consumption of Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18400v1)

Authors: Andrei Lebedev, Vincent Gramoli

With the advent of blockchain technology, the number of proposals has boomed. The network traffic imposed by these blockchain proposals increases the cost of hosting nodes. Unfortunately, as of today, we are not aware of any comparative study of the bandwidth consumption of blockchains.
  In this paper, we propose the first empirical comparison of blockchain bandwidth consumption. To this end, we measure the network traffic of blockchain network nodes of five blockchain protocols: Algorand, Aptos, Avalanche, Redbelly and Solana. We study the variation over time, differentiate the receiving and sending traffic and analyze how this traffic varies with the number of nodes and validators.
  We conclude that the transport protocol is the main factor impacting the network traffic, segregating node roles helps reduce traffic and different blockchains are differently impacted by the network size.

### 9. [COMETS: Coordinated Multi-Destination Video Transmission with In-Network Rate Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18670v1)

Authors: Yulong Zhang, Ying Cui, Zili Meng, Abhishek Kumar, Dirk Kutscher

Large-scale video streaming events attract millions of simultaneous viewers, stressing existing delivery infrastructures. Client-driven adaptation reacts slowly to shared congestion, while server-based coordination introduces scalability bottlenecks and single points of failure. We present COMETS, a coordinated multi-destination video transmission framework that leverages information-centric networking principles such as request aggregation and in-network state awareness to enable scalable, fair, and adaptive rate control. COMETS introduces a novel range-interest protocol and distributed in-network decision process that aligns video quality across receiver groups while minimizing redundant transmissions. To achieve this, we develop a lightweight distributed optimization framework that guides per-hop quality adaptation without centralized control. Extensive emulation shows that COMETS consistently improves bandwidth utilization, fairness, and user-perceived quality of experience over DASH, MoQ, and ICN baselines, particularly under high concurrency. The results highlight COMETS as a practical, deployable approach for next-generation scalable video delivery.

### 10. [A Mechanical Wi-Fi Antenna Device for Automatic Orientation Tuning with Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18256v1)

Authors: Akihito Taya, Yuuki Nishiyama, Kaoru Sezaki

Wi-Fi access points have been widely deployed in homes, offices, and public spaces. Some APs allow users to adjust the antenna orientation to improve communication performance by optimizing antenna polarization. However, it is difficult for non-expert users to determine the optimal orientation, and users often leave the antenna orientation in ineffective positions. To address this issue, we developed a mechanical Wi-Fi antenna device capable of automatically tuning its orientation. Experimental results show that antenna orientation could cause a throughput variation of approximately 70 Mbps under line-of-sight conditions. Furthermore, Bayesian optimization identified better configurations than random search, demonstrating its effectiveness for orientation tuning.

### Robotics

### 1. [Goal-oriented Communication for Fast and Robust Robotic Fault Detection and Recovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18765v1)

Authors: Shutong Chen, Adnan Aijaz, Yansha Deng

Autonomous robotic systems are widely deployed in smart factories and operate in dynamic, uncertain, and human-involved environments that require low-latency and robust fault detection and recovery (FDR). However, existing FDR frameworks exhibit various limitations, such as significant delays in communication and computation, and unreliability in robot motion/trajectory generation, mainly because the communication-computation-control (3C) loop is designed without considering the downstream FDR goal. To address this, we propose a novel Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) framework that jointly designs the 3C loop tailored for fast and robust robotic FDR, with the goal of minimising the FDR time while maximising the robotic task (e.g., workpiece sorting) success rate. For fault detection, our GoC framework innovatively defines and extracts the 3D scene graph (3D-SG) as the semantic representation via our designed representation extractor, and detects faults by monitoring spatial relationship changes in the 3D-SG. For fault recovery, we fine-tune a small language model (SLM) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and enhance its reasoning and generalization capabilities via knowledge distillation to generate recovery motions for robots. We also design a lightweight goal-oriented digital twin reconstruction module to refine the recovery motions generated by the SLM when fine-grained robotic control is required, using only task-relevant object contours for digital twin reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our GoC framework reduces the FDR time by up to 82.6% and improves the task success rate by up to 76%, compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks that rely on vision language models for fault detection and large language models for fault recovery.

### 2. [Trustworthy Evaluation of Robotic Manipulation: A New Benchmark and AutoEval Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18723v1)

Authors: Mengyuan Liu, Juyi Sheng, Peiming Li, Ziyi Wang, Tianming Xu, Tiantian Xu, Hong Liu

Driven by the rapid evolution of Vision-Action and Vision-Language-Action models, imitation learning has significantly advanced robotic manipulation capabilities. However, evaluation methodologies have lagged behind, hindering the establishment of Trustworthy Evaluation for these behaviors. Current paradigms rely on binary success rates, failing to address the critical dimensions of trust: Source Authenticity (i.e., distinguishing genuine policy behaviors from human teleoperation) and Execution Quality (e.g., smoothness and safety). To bridge these gaps, we propose a solution that combines the Eval-Actions benchmark and the AutoEval architecture. First, we construct the Eval-Actions benchmark to support trustworthiness analysis. Distinct from existing datasets restricted to successful human demonstrations, Eval-Actions integrates VA and VLA policy execution trajectories alongside human teleoperation data, explicitly including failure scenarios. This dataset is structured around three core supervision signals: Expert Grading (EG), Rank-Guided preferences (RG), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Building on this, we propose the AutoEval architecture: AutoEval leverages Spatio-Temporal Aggregation for semantic assessment, augmented by an auxiliary Kinematic Calibration Signal to refine motion smoothness; AutoEval Plus (AutoEval-P) incorporates the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) paradigm to enhance logical reasoning capabilities. Experiments show AutoEval achieves Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficients (SRCC) of 0.81 and 0.84 under the EG and RG protocols, respectively. Crucially, the framework possesses robust source discrimination capabilities, distinguishing between policy-generated and teleoperated videos with 99.6% accuracy, thereby establishing a rigorous standard for trustworthy robotic evaluation. Our project and code are available at https://term-bench.github.io/.

Authors: Judith Vilella-Cantos, Mauro Martini, Marcello Chiaberge, Mónica Ballesta, David Valiente

Localization in agricultural environments is challenging due to their unstructured nature and lack of distinctive landmarks. Although agricultural settings have been studied in the context of object classification and segmentation, the place recognition task for mobile robots is not trivial in the current state of the art. In this study, we propose MinkUNeXt-VINE, a lightweight, deep-learning-based method that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in vineyard environments thanks to its pre-processing and Matryoshka Representation Learning multi-loss approach. Our method prioritizes enhanced performance with low-cost, sparse LiDAR inputs and lower-dimensionality outputs to ensure high efficiency in real-time scenarios. Additionally, we present a comprehensive ablation study of the results on various evaluation cases and two extensive long-term vineyard datasets employing different LiDAR sensors. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the trade-off output produced by this approach, as well as its robust performance on low-cost and low-resolution input data. The code is publicly available for reproduction.

### 4. [A Pragmatic VLA Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18692v1)

Offering great potential in robotic manipulation, a capable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model is expected to faithfully generalize across tasks and platforms while ensuring cost efficiency (e.g., data and GPU hours required for adaptation). To this end, we develop LingBot-VLA with around 20,000 hours of real-world data from 9 popular dual-arm robot configurations. Through a systematic assessment on 3 robotic platforms, each completing 100 tasks with 130 post-training episodes per task, our model achieves clear superiority over competitors, showcasing its strong performance and broad generalizability. We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8$\times$ (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.

### 5. [SKETCH: Semantic Key-Point Conditioning for Long-Horizon Vessel Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18537v1)

Authors: Linyong Gan, Zimo Li, Wenxin Xu, Xingjian Li, Jianhua Z. Huang, Enmei Tu, Shuhang Chen

Accurate long-horizon vessel trajectory prediction remains challenging due to compounded uncertainty from complex navigation behaviors and environmental factors. Existing methods often struggle to maintain global directional consistency, leading to drifting or implausible trajectories when extrapolated over long time horizons. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-key-point-conditioned trajectory modeling framework, in which future trajectories are predicted by conditioning on a high-level Next Key Point (NKP) that captures navigational intent. This formulation decomposes long-horizon prediction into global semantic decision-making and local motion modeling, effectively restricting the support of future trajectories to semantically feasible subsets. To efficiently estimate the NKP prior from historical observations, we adopt a pretrain-finetune strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly for long travel durations, directional accuracy, and fine-grained trajectory prediction.

### 6. [DV-VLN: Dual Verification for Reliable LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18492v1)

Authors: Zijun Li, Shijie Li, Zhenxi Zhang, Bin Li, Shoujun Zhou

Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to navigate in a complex 3D environment according to natural language instructions. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled language-driven navigation with improved interpretability. However, most LLM-based agents still rely on single-shot action decisions, where the model must choose one option from noisy, textualized multi-perspective observations. Due to local mismatches and imperfect intermediate reasoning, such decisions can easily deviate from the correct path, leading to error accumulation and reduced reliability in unseen environments. In this paper, we propose DV-VLN, a new VLN framework that follows a generate-then-verify paradigm. DV-VLN first performs parameter-efficient in-domain adaptation of an open-source LLaMA-2 backbone to produce a structured navigational chain-of-thought, and then verifies candidate actions with two complementary channels: True-False Verification (TFV) and Masked-Entity Verification (MEV). DV-VLN selects actions by aggregating verification successes across multiple samples, yielding interpretable scores for reranking. Experiments on R2R, RxR (English subset), and REVERIE show that DV-VLN consistently improves over direct prediction and sampling-only baselines, achieving competitive performance among language-only VLN agents and promising results compared with several cross-modal systems.Code is available at https://github.com/PlumJun/DV-VLN.

### 7. [TC-IDM: Grounding Video Generation for Executable Zero-shot Robot Motion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18323v1)

Authors: Weishi Mi, Yong Bao, Xiaowei Chi, Xiaozhu Ju, Zhiyuan Qin, Kuangzhi Ge, Kai Tang, Peidong Jia, Shanghang Zhang, Jian Tang

The vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm has enabled powerful robotic control by leveraging vision-language models, but its reliance on large-scale, high-quality robot data limits its generalization. Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions.
  To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajectory as synthesized by the world model, TC-IDM establishes a robust intermediate representation that bridges the gap between visual planning and physical control.
  TC-IDM extracts the tool's point cloud trajectories via segmentation and 3D motion estimation from generated videos. Considering diverse tool attributes, our architecture employs decoupled action heads to project these planned trajectories into 6-DoF end-effector motions and corresponding control signals.
  This plan-and-translate paradigm not only supports a wide range of end-effectors but also significantly improves viewpoint invariance. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities across long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks, including interacting with deformable objects.
  In real-world evaluations, the world model with TC-IDM achieves an average success rate of 61.11 percent, with 77.7 percent on simple tasks and 38.46 percent on zero-shot deformable object tasks. It substantially outperforms end-to-end VLA-style baselines and other inverse dynamics models.

### 8. [ExoGS: A 4D Real-to-Sim-to-Real Framework for Scalable Manipulation Data Collection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18629v1)

Authors: Yiming Wang, Ruogu Zhang, Minyang Li, Hao Shi, Junbo Wang, Deyi Li, Jieji Ren, Wenhai Liu, Weiming Wang, Hao-Shu Fang

Real-to-Sim-to-Real technique is gaining increasing interest for robotic manipulation, as it can generate scalable data in simulation while having narrower sim-to-real gap. However, previous methods mainly focused on environment-level visual real-to-sim transfer, ignoring the transfer of interactions, which could be challenging and inefficient to obtain purely in simulation especially for contact-rich tasks. We propose ExoGS, a robot-free 4D Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that captures both static environments and dynamic interactions in the real world and transfers them seamlessly to a simulated environment. It provides a new solution for scalable manipulation data collection and policy learning. ExoGS employs a self-designed robot-isomorphic passive exoskeleton AirExo-3 to capture kinematically consistent trajectories with millimeter-level accuracy and synchronized RGB observations during direct human demonstrations. The robot, objects, and environment are reconstructed as editable 3D Gaussian Splatting assets, enabling geometry-consistent replay and large-scale data augmentation. Additionally, a lightweight Mask Adapter injects instance-level semantics into the policy to enhance robustness under visual domain shifts. Real-world experiments demonstrate that ExoGS significantly improves data efficiency and policy generalization compared to teleoperation-based baselines. Code and hardware files have been released on https://github.com/zaixiabalala/ExoGS.

### 9. [Beyond Static Datasets: Robust Offline Policy Optimization via Vetted Synthetic Transitions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18107v1)

Authors: Pedram Agand, Mo Chen

Offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) holds immense promise for safety-critical domains like industrial robotics, where real-time environmental interaction is often prohibitive. A primary obstacle in ORL remains the distributional shift between the static dataset and the learned policy, which typically mandates high degrees of conservatism that can restrain potential policy improvements. We present MoReBRAC, a model-based framework that addresses this limitation through Uncertainty-Aware latent synthesis. Instead of relying solely on the fixed data, MoReBRAC utilizes a dual-recurrent world model to synthesize high-fidelity transitions that augment the training manifold. To ensure the reliability of this synthetic data, we implement a hierarchical uncertainty pipeline integrating Variational Autoencoder (VAE) manifold detection, model sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. This multi-layered filtering process guarantees that only transitions residing within high-confidence regions of the learned dynamics are utilized. Our results on D4RL Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks reveal significant performance gains, particularly in ``random'' and ``suboptimal'' data regimes. We further provide insights into the role of the VAE as a geometric anchor and discuss the distributional trade-offs encountered when learning from near-optimal datasets.

### 10. [Fast and Safe Trajectory Optimization for Mobile Manipulators With Neural Configuration Space Distance Field](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18548v1)

Authors: Yulin Li, Zhiyuan Song, Yiming Li, Zhicheng Song, Kai Chen, Chunxin Zheng, Zhihai Bi, Jiahang Cao, Sylvain Calinon, Fan Shi, Jun Ma

Mobile manipulators promise agile, long-horizon behavior by coordinating base and arm motion, yet whole-body trajectory optimization in cluttered, confined spaces remains difficult due to high-dimensional nonconvexity and the need for fast, accurate collision reasoning. Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) enable fixed-base manipulators to model collisions directly in configuration space via smooth, implicit distances. This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning. The solver scales to large numbers of implicit constraints through (i) online specification of neural constraints, (ii) sparsity-aware active-set detection with parallel batched evaluation across thousands of constraints, and (iii) incremental constraint management for rapid replanning under scene changes.

Authors: Giuseppe Destefanis, Leila Yousefi, Martin Shepperd, Allan Tucker, Stephen Swift, Steve Counsell, Mahir Arzoky

Background: Machine learning algorithms are widely used to predict defect prone software components. In this literature, computational experiments are the main means of evaluation, and the credibility of results depends on experimental design and reporting. Objective: This paper audits recent software defect prediction (SDP) studies by assessing their experimental design, analysis, and reporting practices against accepted norms from statistics, machine learning, and empirical software engineering. The aim is to characterise current practice and assess the reproducibility of published results. Method: We audited SDP studies indexed in SCOPUS between 2019 and 2023, focusing on design and analysis choices such as outcome measures, out of sample validation strategies, and the use of statistical inference. Nine study issues were evaluated. Reproducibility was assessed using the instrument proposed by González Barahona and Robles. Results: The search identified approximately 1,585 SDP experiments published during the period. From these, we randomly sampled 101 papers, including 61 journal and 40 conference publications, with almost 50 percent behind paywalls. We observed substantial variation in research practice. The number of datasets ranged from 1 to 365, learners or learner variants from 1 to 34, and performance measures from 1 to 9. About 45 percent of studies applied formal statistical inference. Across the sample, we identified 427 issues, with a median of four per paper, and only one paper without issues. Reproducibility ranged from near complete to severely limited. We also identified two cases of tortured phrases and possible paper mill activity. Conclusions: Experimental design and reporting practices vary widely, and almost half of the studies provide insufficient detail to support reproduction. The audit indicates substantial scope for improvement.

### 2. [AI Agent for Reverse-Engineering Legacy Finite-Difference Code and Translating to Devito](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18381v1)

Authors: Yinghan Hou, Zongyou Yang

To facilitate the transformation of legacy finite difference implementations into the Devito environment, this study develops an integrated AI agent framework. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and open-source Large Language Models are combined through multi-stage iterative workflows in the system's hybrid LangGraph architecture. The agent constructs an extensive Devito knowledge graph through document parsing, structure-aware segmentation, extraction of entity relationships, and Leiden-based community detection. GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior.

Authors: Elena Bruches, Vadim Alperovich, Dari Baturova, Roman Derunets, Daniil Grebenkin, Georgy Mkrtchyan, Oleg Sedukhin, Mikhail Klementev, Ivan Bondarenko, Nikolay Bushkov, Stanislav Moiseev

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software engineering, their application to unit testing remains largely confined to isolated test generation or oracle prediction, neglecting the broader challenge of test suite maintenance. We introduce TAM-Eval (Test Automated Maintenance Evaluation), a framework and benchmark designed to evaluate model performance across three core test maintenance scenarios: creation, repair, and updating of test suites. Unlike prior work limited to function-level tasks, TAM-Eval operates at the test file level, while maintaining access to full repository context during isolated evaluation, better reflecting real-world maintenance workflows. Our benchmark comprises 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from Python, Java, and Go projects. TAM-Eval supports system-agnostic evaluation of both raw LLMs and agentic workflows, using a reference-free protocol based on test suite pass rate, code coverage, and mutation testing. Empirical results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs have limited capabilities in realistic test maintenance processes and yield only marginal improvements in test effectiveness. We release TAM-Eval as an open-source framework to support future research in automated software testing. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/trndcenter/TAM-Eval.

### 4. [daVinci-Dev: Agent-native Mid-training for Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18418v1)

Recently, the frontier of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities has shifted from single-turn code generation to agentic software engineering-a paradigm where models autonomously navigate, edit, and test complex repositories. While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, **agentic mid-training**-mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning. A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B). Besides relative advantage, our best performing 32B and 72B models achieve **56.1%** and **58.5%** resolution rates, respectively, which are ...

### 5. [Agentic Much? Adoption of Coding Agents on GitHub](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18341v1)

Authors: Romain Robbes, Théo Matricon, Thomas Degueule, Andre Hora, Stefano Zacchiroli

In the first half of 2025, coding agents have emerged as a category of development tools that have very quickly transitioned to the practice. Unlike ''traditional'' code completion LLMs such as Copilot, agents like Cursor, Claude Code, or Codex operate with high degrees of autonomy, up to generating complete pull requests starting from a developer-provided task description. This new mode of operation is poised to change the landscape in an even larger way than code completion LLMs did, making the need to study their impact critical. Also, unlike traditional LLMs, coding agents tend to leave more explicit traces in software engineering artifacts, such as co-authoring commits or pull requests. We leverage these traces to present the first large-scale study (129,134 projects) of the adoption of coding agents on GitHub, finding an estimated adoption rate of 15.85%--22.60%, which is very high for a technology only a few months old--and increasing. We carry out an in-depth study of the adopters we identified, finding that adoption is broad: it spans the entire spectrum of project maturity; it includes established organizations; and it concerns diverse programming languages or project topics. At the commit level, we find that commits assisted by coding agents are larger than commits only authored by human developers, and have a large proportion of features and bug fixes. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the practical use of coding agents.

Authors: Haruhiko Yoshioka, Takahiro Monno, Haruka Tokumasu, Taiki Wakamatsu, Yuki Ota, Nimmi Weeraddana, Kenichi Matsumoto

The automatic generation of pull requests (PRs) using AI agents has become increasingly common. Although AI-generated PRs are fast and easy to create, their merge rates have been reported to be lower than those created by humans. In this study, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of 40,214 PRs collected from the AIDev dataset. We extract 64 features across six families and fit statistical regression models to compare PR merge outcomes for human and agentic PRs, as well as across three AI agents. Our results show that submitter attributes dominate merge outcomes for both groups, while review-related features exhibit contrasting effects between human and agentic PRs. The findings of this study provide insights into improving PR quality through human-AI collaboration.

### 7. [On the Abolition of the "ICSE Paper" and the Adoption of the "Registered Proposal" and the "Results Report"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18566v1)

Authors: Fabio Massacci, Winnie Mbaka

To address the 'novelty-vicious cycle' and the 'replicability crisis' of the field (both discussed in the survey) we propose abolishing the "ICSE paper" as we know it and replacing it with a two-tier system that also evolves the existing notion of 'Registered Report'. Authors proposing a new idea, experiment, or analysis would submit a "Registered Proposal" of their idea and the proposed experimental methodology to undergo peer review. The following year, anyone can submit (shorter) "Results Reports" on the realization of the empirical work based on the registered proposals of the previous ICSE (or FSE or ISSTA or ASE etc.). Both works should be first class citizens of the mainstream events. We argue that such a disruptive (heretical?) idea is supported and based on the responses of the community of the Future of Software Engineering pre-survey

Authors: Romain Robes Théo Matricon, Thomas Degueule, Andre Hora, Stefano Zacchiroli

In 2025, coding agents have seen a very rapid adoption. Coding agents leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in ways that are markedly different from LLM-based code completion, making their study critical. Moreover, unlike LLM-based completion, coding agents leave visible traces in software repositories, enabling the use of MSR techniques to study their impact on SE practices. This paper documents the promises, perils, and heuristics that we have gathered from studying coding agent activity on GitHub.

### 9. [How are MLOps Frameworks Used in Open Source Projects? An Empirical Characterization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18591v1)

Authors: Fiorella Zampetti, Federico Stocchetti, Federica Razzano, Damian Andrew Tamburri, Massimiliano Di Penta

Machine Learning (ML) Operations (MLOps) frameworks have been conceived to support developers and AI engineers in managing the lifecycle of their ML models. While such frameworks provide a wide range of features, developers may leverage only a subset of them, while missing some highly desired features. This paper investigates the practical use and desired feature enhancements of eight popular open-source MLOps frameworks. Specifically, we analyze their usage by dependent projects on GitHub, examining how they invoke the frameworks' APIs and commands. Then, we qualitatively analyze feature requests and enhancements mined from the frameworks' issue trackers, relating these desired improvements to the previously identified usage features. Results indicate that MLOps frameworks are rarely used out-of-the-box and are infrequently integrated into GitHub Workflows, but rather, developers use their APIs to implement custom functionality in their projects. Used features concern core ML phases and whole infrastructure governance, sometimes leveraging multiple frameworks with complementary features. The mapping with feature requests highlights that users mainly ask for enhancements to core features of the frameworks, but also better API exposure and CI/CD integration.

### 10. [Forecasting the Maintained Score from the OpenSSF Scorecard for GitHub Repositories linked to PyPI libraries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18344v1)

Authors: Alexandros Tsakpinis, Efe Berk Ergülec, Emil Schwenger, Alexander Pretschner

The OpenSSF Scorecard is widely used to assess the security posture of open-source software repositories, with the Maintained metric indicating recent development activity and helping identify potentially abandoned dependencies. However, this metric is inherently retrospective, reflecting only the past 90 days of activity and providing no insight into future maintenance, which limits its usefulness for proactive risk assessment. In this paper, we study to what extent future maintenance activity, as captured by the OpenSSF Maintained score, can be forecasted. We analyze 3,220 GitHub repositories associated with the top 1% most central PyPI libraries by PageRank and reconstruct historical Maintained scores over a three-year period. We formulate the task as multivariate time series forecasting and consider four target representations: raw scores, bucketed maintenance levels, numerical trend slopes, and categorical trend types. We compare a statistical model (VARMA), a machine learning model (Random Forest), and a deep learning model (LSTM) across training windows of 3-12 months and forecasting horizons of 1-6 months. Our results show that future maintenance activity can be predicted with meaningful accuracy, particularly for aggregated representations such as bucketed scores and trend types, achieving accuracies above 0.95 and 0.80, respectively. Simpler statistical and machine learning models perform on par with deep learning approaches, indicating that complex architectures are not required. These findings suggest that predictive modeling can effectively complement existing Scorecard metrics, enabling more proactive assessment of open-source maintenance risks.

### 1. [A Generative AI-Driven Reliability Layer for Action-Oriented Disaster Resilience](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18308v1)

Authors: Geunsik Lim

As climate-related hazards intensify, conventional early warning systems (EWS) disseminate alerts rapidly but often fail to trigger timely protective actions, leading to preventable losses and inequities. We introduce Climate RADAR (Risk-Aware, Dynamic, and Action Recommendation system), a generative AI-based reliability layer that reframes disaster communication from alerts delivered to actions executed. It integrates meteorological, hydrological, vulnerability, and social data into a composite risk index and employs guardrail-embedded large language models (LLMs) to deliver personalized recommendations across citizen, volunteer, and municipal interfaces. Evaluation through simulations, user studies, and a municipal pilot shows improved outcomes, including higher protective action execution, reduced response latency, and increased usability and trust. By combining predictive analytics, behavioral science, and responsible AI, Climate RADAR advances people-centered, transparent, and equitable early warning systems, offering practical pathways toward compliance-ready disaster resilience infrastructures.

Authors: João Phillipe Cardenuto, Ana Carolina Monari, Michelle Diniz Lopes, Leopoldo Lusquino Filho, Anderson Rocha

Over the past decade, Brazil has experienced a decline in vaccination coverage, reversing decades of public health progress achieved through the National Immunization Program (PNI). Growing evidence points to the widespread circulation of vaccine-related misinformation -- particularly on social media platforms -- as a key factor driving this decline. Among these platforms, Telegram remains the only major platform permitting accessible and ethical data collection, offering insight into public channels where vaccine misinformation circulates extensively. This data paper introduces a curated dataset of about four million Telegram posts collected from 119 prominent Brazilian anti-vaccine channels between 2020 and 2025. The dataset includes message content, metadata, associated media, and classification related to vaccine posts, enabling researchers to examine how false or misleading information spreads, evolves, and influences public sentiment. By providing this resource, our aim is to support the scientific and public health community in developing evidence-based strategies to counter misinformation, promote trust in vaccination, and engage compassionately with individuals and communities affected by false narratives. The dataset and documentation are openly available for non-commercial research, under strict ethical and privacy guidelines at https://doi.org/10.25824/redu/5JIVDT

### 3. [The Cost of Inflation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18544v1)

Authors: Vipin P Veetil

Empirical evidence suggests that there is little to no correlation between the rate of inflation and the size of price change. Economists have hitherto taken this to mean that monetary shocks do not generate much deviation in relative prices and therefore inflation does not hurt the economy by impeding the workings of the price system. This paper presents a production network model of inflationary dynamics in which it is well possible for inflation to have near-zero correlation with the size of price change yet cause significant distortion of relative prices. The relative price distortion caused by inflation critically depends on the spectral gap, degree distribution, and assortativity of the production network.

Authors: Sara Solarova, Matúš Mesarčík, Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba

Algorithms of online platforms are required under the Digital Services Act (DSA) to comply with specific obligations concerning algorithmic transparency, user protection and privacy. To verify compliance with these requirements, DSA mandates platforms to undergo independent audits. Little is known about current auditing practices and their effectiveness in ensuring such compliance. To this end, we bridge regulatory and technical perspectives by critically examining selected audit reports across three critical algorithmic-related provisions: restrictions on profiling minors, transparency in recommender systems, and limitations on targeted advertising using sensitive data. Our analysis shows significant inconsistencies in methodologies and lack of technical depth when evaluating AI-powered systems. To enhance the depth, scale, and independence of compliance assessments, we propose to employ algorithmic auditing -- a process of behavioural assessment of AI algorithms by means of simulating user behaviour, observing algorithm responses and analysing them for audited phenomena.

### 5. [Explaining Synergistic Effects in Social Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18151v1)

Authors: Yicong Li, Shan Jin, Qi Liu, Shuo Wang, Jiaying Liu, Shuo Yu, Qiang Zhang, Kuanjiu Zhou, Feng Xia

In social recommenders, the inherent nonlinearity and opacity of synergistic effects across multiple social networks hinders users from understanding how diverse information is leveraged for recommendations, consequently diminishing explainability. However, existing explainers can only identify the topological information in social networks that significantly influences recommendations, failing to further explain the synergistic effects among this information. Inspired by existing findings that synergistic effects enhance mutual information between inputs and predictions to generate information gain, we extend this discovery to graph data. We quantify graph information gain to identify subgraphs embodying synergistic effects. Based on the theoretical insights, we propose SemExplainer, which explains synergistic effects by identifying subgraphs that embody them. SemExplainer first extracts explanatory subgraphs from multi-view social networks to generate preliminary importance explanations for recommendations. A conditional entropy optimization strategy to maximize information gain is developed, thereby further identifying subgraphs that embody synergistic effects from explanatory subgraphs. Finally, SemExplainer searches for paths from users to recommended items within the synergistic subgraphs to generate explanations for the recommendations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of SemExplainer over baseline methods, providing superior explanations of synergistic effects.

Authors: Yadang Alexis Rouzoumka, Jean Pinsolle, Eugénie Terreaux, Christèle Morisseau, Jean-Philippe Ovarlez, Chengfang Ren

We investigate the detection of weak complex-valued signals immersed in non-Gaussian, range-varying interference, with emphasis on maritime radar scenarios. The proposed methodology exploits a Complex-valued Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) trained exclusively on clutter-plus-noise to perform Out-Of-Distribution detection. By operating directly on in-phase / quadrature samples, the CVAE preserves phase and Doppler structure and is assessed in two configurations: (i) using unprocessed range profiles and (ii) after local whitening, where per-range covariance estimates are obtained from neighboring profiles. Using extensive simulations together with real sea-clutter data from the CSIR maritime dataset, we benchmark performance against classical and adaptive detectors (MF, NMF, AMF-SCM, ANMF-SCM, ANMF-Tyler). In both configurations, the CVAE yields a higher detection probability Pd at matched false-alarm rate Pfa, with the most notable improvements observed under whitening. We further integrate the CVAE with the ANMF through a weighted log-p fusion rule at the decision level, attaining enhanced robustness in strongly non-Gaussian clutter and enabling empirically calibrated Pfa control under H0. Overall, the results demonstrate that statistical normalization combined with complex-valued generative modeling substantively improves detection in realistic sea-clutter conditions, and that the fused CVAE-ANMF scheme constitutes a competitive alternative to established model-based detectors.

Authors: Yingxiao Huo, Satya Prakash Dash, Radu Stoican, Samuel Kaski, Mingfei Sun

Natural gradients have long been studied in deep reinforcement learning due to their fast convergence properties and covariant weight updates. However, computing natural gradients requires inversion of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) at each iteration, which is computationally prohibitive in nature. In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable natural policy optimization technique that leverages a rank-1 approximation to full inverse-FIM. We theoretically show that under certain conditions, a rank-1 approximation to inverse-FIM converges faster than policy gradients and, under some conditions, enjoys the same sample complexity as stochastic policy gradient methods. We benchmark our method on a diverse set of environments and show that it achieves superior performance to standard actor-critic and trust-region baselines.

Authors: Chao Wang, Xuanying Li, Cheng Dai, Jinglei Feng, Yuxiang Luo, Yuqi Ouyang, Hao Qin

Wireframe parsing aims to recover line segments and their junctions to form a structured geometric representation useful for downstream tasks such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Existing methods predict lines and junctions separately and reconcile them post-hoc, causing mismatches and reduced robustness. We present Co-PLNet, a point-line collaborative framework that exchanges spatial cues between the two tasks, where early detections are converted into spatial prompts via a Point-Line Prompt Encoder (PLP-Encoder), which encodes geometric attributes into compact and spatially aligned maps. A Cross-Guidance Line Decoder (CGL-Decoder) then refines predictions with sparse attention conditioned on complementary prompts, enforcing point-line consistency and efficiency. Experiments on Wireframe and YorkUrban show consistent improvements in accuracy and robustness, together with favorable real-time efficiency, demonstrating our effectiveness for structured geometry perception.

### 4. [Unsupervised Text Segmentation via Kernel Change-Point Detection on Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18788v1)

Authors: Mumin Jia, Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez

Unsupervised text segmentation is crucial because boundary labels are expensive, subjective, and often fail to transfer across domains and granularity choices. We propose Embed-KCPD, a training-free method that represents sentences as embedding vectors and estimates boundaries by minimizing a penalized KCPD objective. Beyond the algorithmic instantiation, we develop, to our knowledge, the first dependence-aware theory for KCPD under $m$-dependent sequences, a finite-memory abstraction of short-range dependence common in language. We prove an oracle inequality for the population penalized risk and a localization guarantee showing that each true change point is recovered within a window that is small relative to segment length. To connect theory to practice, we introduce an LLM-based simulation framework that generates synthetic documents with controlled finite-memory dependence and known boundaries, validating the predicted scaling behavior. Across standard segmentation benchmarks, Embed-KCPD often outperforms strong unsupervised baselines. A case study on Taylor Swift's tweets illustrates that Embed-KCPD combines strong theoretical guarantees, simulated reliability, and practical effectiveness for text segmentation.

### 5. [Success Conditioning as Policy Improvement: The Optimization Problem Solved by Imitating Success](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18175v1)

Authors: Daniel Russo

A widely used technique for improving policies is success conditioning, in which one collects trajectories, identifies those that achieve a desired outcome, and updates the policy to imitate the actions taken along successful trajectories. This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $χ^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective.

### 6. [Exact Minimum-Volume Confidence Set Intersection for Multinomial Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18145v1)

Authors: Heguang Lin, Binhao Chen, Mengze Li, Daniel Pimentel-Alarcón, Matthew L. Malloy

Computation of confidence sets is central to data science and machine learning, serving as the workhorse of A/B testing and underpinning the operation and analysis of reinforcement learning algorithms. Among all valid confidence sets for the multinomial parameter, minimum-volume confidence sets (MVCs) are optimal in that they minimize average volume, but they are defined as level sets of an exact p-value that is discontinuous and difficult to compute. Rather than attempting to characterize the geometry of MVCs directly, this paper studies a practically motivated decision problem: given two observed multinomial outcomes, can one certify whether their MVCs intersect? We present a certified, tolerance-aware algorithm for this intersection problem. The method exploits the fact that likelihood ordering induces halfspace constraints in log-odds coordinates, enabling adaptive geometric partitioning of parameter space and computable lower and upper bounds on p-values over each cell. For three categories, this yields an efficient and provably sound algorithm that either certifies intersection, certifies disjointness, or returns an indeterminate result when the decision lies within a prescribed margin. We further show how the approach extends to higher dimensions. The results demonstrate that, despite their irregular geometry, MVCs admit reliable certified decision procedures for core tasks in A/B testing.

### 7. [Nonlinear multi-study factor analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18128v1)

Authors: Gemma E. Moran, Anandi Krishnan

High-dimensional data often exhibit variation that can be captured by lower dimensional factors. For high-dimensional data from multiple studies or environments, one goal is to understand which underlying factors are common to all studies, and which factors are study or environment-specific. As a particular example, we consider platelet gene expression data from patients in different disease groups. In this data, factors correspond to clusters of genes which are co-expressed; we may expect some clusters (or biological pathways) to be active for all diseases, while some clusters are only active for a specific disease. To learn these factors, we consider a nonlinear multi-study factor model, which allows for both shared and specific factors. To fit this model, we propose a multi-study sparse variational autoencoder. The underlying model is sparse in that each observed feature (i.e. each dimension of the data) depends on a small subset of the latent factors. In the genomics example, this means each gene is active in only a few biological processes. Further, the model implicitly induces a penalty on the number of latent factors, which helps separate the shared factors from the group-specific factors. We prove that the latent factors are identified, and demonstrate our method recovers meaningful factors in the platelet gene expression data.

### 8. [Contrasting Global and Patient-Specific Regression Models via a Neural Network Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18658v1)

Authors: Max Behrens, Daiana Stolz, Eleni Papakonstantinou, Janis M. Nolde, Gabriele Bellerino, Angelika Rohde, Moritz Hess, Harald Binder

When developing clinical prediction models, it can be challenging to balance between global models that are valid for all patients and personalized models tailored to individuals or potentially unknown subgroups. To aid such decisions, we propose a diagnostic tool for contrasting global regression models and patient-specific (local) regression models. The core utility of this tool is to identify where and for whom a global model may be inadequate. We focus on regression models and specifically suggest a localized regression approach that identifies regions in the predictor space where patients are not well represented by the global model. As localization becomes challenging when dealing with many predictors, we propose modeling in a dimension-reduced latent representation obtained from an autoencoder. Using such a neural network architecture for dimension reduction enables learning a latent representation simultaneously optimized for both good data reconstruction and for revealing local outcome-related associations suitable for robust localized regression. We illustrate the proposed approach with a clinical study involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Our findings indicate that the global model is adequate for most patients but that indeed specific subgroups benefit from personalized models. We also demonstrate how to map these subgroup models back to the original predictors, providing insight into why the global model falls short for these groups. Thus, the principal application and diagnostic yield of our tool is the identification and characterization of patients or subgroups whose outcome associations deviate from the global model.

### 9. [Universality of Many-body Projected Ensemble for Learning Quantum Data Distribution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18637v1)

Authors: Quoc Hoan Tran, Koki Chinzei, Yasuhiro Endo, Hirotaka Oshima

Generating quantum data by learning the underlying quantum distribution poses challenges in both theoretical and practical scenarios, yet it is a critical task for understanding quantum systems. A fundamental question in quantum machine learning (QML) is the universality of approximation: whether a parameterized QML model can approximate any quantum distribution. We address this question by proving a universality theorem for the Many-body Projected Ensemble (MPE) framework, a method for quantum state design that uses a single many-body wave function to prepare random states. This demonstrates that MPE can approximate any distribution of pure states within a 1-Wasserstein distance error. This theorem provides a rigorous guarantee of universal expressivity, addressing key theoretical gaps in QML. For practicality, we propose an Incremental MPE variant with layer-wise training to improve the trainability. Numerical experiments on clustered quantum states and quantum chemistry datasets validate MPE's efficacy in learning complex quantum data distributions.

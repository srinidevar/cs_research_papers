### Artificial Intelligence

### 1. [Agentic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (Agentic XAI) Approach To Explore Better Explanation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21066v1)

Authors: Tomoaki Yamaguchi, Yutong Zhou, Masahiro Ryo, Keisuke Katsura

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

### 2. [Distilling the Essence: Efficient Reasoning Distillation via Sequence Truncation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21002v1)

Authors: Wei-Rui Chen, Vignesh Kothapalli, Ata Fatahibaarzi, Hejian Sang, Shao Tang, Qingquan Song, Zhipeng Wang, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed

Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

### 3. [Automatic Replication of LLM Mistakes in Medical Conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20983v1)

Authors: Oleksii Proniakin, Diego Fajardo, Ruslan Nazarenko, Razvan Marinescu

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

### 4. [Can Agentic AI Match the Performance of Human Data Scientists?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20959v1)

Authors: An Luo, Jin Du, Fangqiao Tian, Xun Xian, Robert Specht, Ganghua Wang, Xuan Bi, Charles Fleming, Jayanth Srinivasa, Ashish Kundu, Mingyi Hong, Jie Ding

Data science plays a critical role in transforming complex data into actionable insights across numerous domains. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.

### 5. [One Tool Is Enough: Reinforcement Learning for Repository-Level LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20957v1)

Authors: Zhaoxi Zhang, Yitong Duan, Yanzhi Zhang, Yiming Xu, Jiyan He, Yunfang Wu

Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.

### 6. [Neural Probe-Based Hallucination Detection for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20949v1)

Authors: Shize Liang, Hongzhi Wang

Large language models(LLMs) excel at text generation and knowledge question-answering tasks, but they are prone to generating hallucinated content, severely limiting their application in high-risk domains. Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

### 7. [Guardrailed Elasticity Pricing: A Churn-Aware Forecasting Playbook for Subscription Strategy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20932v1)

Authors: Deepit Sapru

This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.

### 8. [Embodied AI-Enhanced IoMT Edge Computing: UAV Trajectory Optimization and Task Offloading with Mobility Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20902v1)

Authors: Siqi Mu, Shuo Wen, Yang Lu, Ruihong Jiang, Bo Ai

Due to their inherent flexibility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to provide real-time biomedical edge computing service for wireless body area network (WBAN) users. In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.

### 9. [The Silent Scholar Problem: A Probabilistic Framework for Breaking Epistemic Asymmetry in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20884v1)

Authors: Zan-Kai Chong, Hiroyuki Ohsaki, Bryan Ng

Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

We introduce the Nemotron 3 family of models - Nano, Super, and Ultra. These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference. Super is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads such as IT ticket automation. Ultra, the largest model, provides state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance. Nano is released together with its technical report and this white paper, while Super and Ultra will follow in the coming months. We will openly release the model weights, pre- and post-training software, recipes, and all data for which we hold redistribution rights.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [ElfCore: A 28nm Neural Processor Enabling Dynamic Structured Sparse Training and Online Self-Supervised Learning with Activity-Dependent Weight Update](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21153v1)

Authors: Zhe Su, Giacomo Indiveri

In this paper, we present ElfCore, a 28nm digital spiking neural network processor tailored for event-driven sensory signal processing. ElfCore is the first to efficiently integrate: (1) a local online self-supervised learning engine that enables multi-layer temporal learning without labeled inputs; (2) a dynamic structured sparse training engine that supports high-accuracy sparse-to-sparse learning; and (3) an activity-dependent sparse weight update mechanism that selectively updates weights based solely on input activity and network dynamics. Demonstrated on tasks including gesture recognition, speech, and biomedical signal processing, ElfCore outperforms state-of-the-art solutions with up to 16X lower power consumption, 3.8X reduced on-chip memory requirements, and 5.9X greater network capacity efficiency.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [Adjusted Kolmogorov Complexity of Binary Words with Empirical Entropy Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21193v1)

Authors: Brani Vidakovic

Kolmogorov complexity of a finite binary word reflects both algorithmic structure and the empirical distribution of symbols appearing in the word. Words with symbol frequencies far from one half have smaller combinatorial richness and therefore appear less complex under the standard definition. In this paper an entropy-normalized complexity measure is introduced that divides the Kolmogorov complexity of a word by the empirical entropy of its observed distribution of zeros and ones. This adjustment isolates intrinsic descriptive complexity from the purely combinatorial effect of symbol imbalance. For Martin Löf random sequences under constructive exchangeable measures, the adjusted complexity grows linearly and converges to one. A pathological construction shows that regularity of the underlying measure is essential. The proposed framework connects Kolmogorov complexity, empirical entropy, and randomness in a natural manner and suggests applications in randomness testing and in the analysis of structured binary data.

### 2. [Stochastic well-structured transition systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20939v1)

Authors: James Aspnes

Extending well-structured transition systems to incorporate a probabilistic scheduling rule, we define a new class of stochastic well-structured transition systems that includes population protocols, chemical reaction networks, and many common gossip models; as well as augmentations of these systems by an oracle that exposes a total order on agents as in population protocols in the comparison model or an equivalence relation as in population protocols with unordered data.
  We show that any implementation of a phase clock in these systems either stops or ticks too fast after polynomially many expected steps, and that any terminating computation in these systems finishes or fails in expected polynomial time. This latter property allows an exact characterization of the computational power of many stochastic well-structured transition systems augmented with a total order or equivalence relation on agents, showing that these compute exactly the languages in BPP, while the corresponding unaugmented systems compute just the symmetric languages in BPL.

### Computational Engineering

### 1. [A Mechanistic Analysis of Transformers for Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21113v1)

Authors: Gregory Duthé, Nikolaos Evangelou, Wei Liu, Ioannis G. Kevrekidis, Eleni Chatzi

Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.

### 2. [When Experts Speak:Sequential LLM-Bayesian Learning for Startup Success Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20900v1)

Authors: Yidong Chai, Yanguang Liu, Xuan Tian, Jiaheng Xie, Yonghang Zhou

Evaluating startups is inherently challenging in entrepreneurial finance, where investors confront severe information asymmetry and limited quantitative data. Leveraging a novel expert network call data, we develop an LLM-Bayesian model that analyzes these conversations at the question-answer turn level, extracting semantic and evaluative signals via large language models (LLMs) and aggregating them in a sequential Bayesian architecture. The model dynamically updates beliefs as additional expert calls occur and attenuates contradictory assessments, which are absent from existing text-based screening tools. Empirically, our model outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by 6.691% in F1-score and increases portfolio-level Return on Investment by 15.255%. Attention and ablation analyses reveal that conversational cues are particularly informative for technologically complex startups, young firms, diverse founding teams, and firms with low public visibility. By converting expert dialogue into continually updated probabilities, our model advances research in entrepreneurial finance and information systems and offers policy implications for improving funding outcomes for informationally disadvantaged startups.

### 3. [Quantum Homotopy Algorithm for Solving Nonlinear PDEs and Flow Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21033v1)

Authors: Sachin S. Bharadwaj, Balasubramanya Nadiga, Stephan Eidenbenz, Katepalli R. Sreenivasan

Quantum algorithms to integrate nonlinear PDEs governing flow problems are challenging to discover but critical to enhancing the practical usefulness of quantum computing. We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.

### Computational Geometry

### 1. [Uncovering Hierarchical Structure in LLM Embeddings with $δ$-Hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20926v1)

Authors: Prakash Chourasia, Sarwan Ali, Murray Patterson

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled significant strides in various fields. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM embeddings in the context of inherent geometric properties. We investigate the structural properties of these embeddings through three complementary metrics $δ$-hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining. $δ$-hyperbolicity, a measure derived from geometric group theory, quantifies how much a metric space deviates from being a tree-like structure. In contrast, ultrametricity characterizes strictly hierarchical structures where distances obey a strong triangle inequality. While Neighbor Joining quantifies how tree-like the distance relationships are, it does so specifically with respect to the tree reconstructed by the Neighbor Joining algorithm. By analyzing the embeddings generated by LLMs using these metrics, we uncover to what extent the embedding space reflects an underlying hierarchical or tree-like organization. Our findings reveal that LLM embeddings exhibit varying degrees of hyperbolicity and ultrametricity, which correlate with their performance in the underlying machine learning tasks.

Authors: Wei-Rui Chen, Vignesh Kothapalli, Ata Fatahibaarzi, Hejian Sang, Shao Tang, Qingquan Song, Zhipeng Wang, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed

Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

### 4. [Decoding Predictive Inference in Visual Language Processing via Spatiotemporal Neural Coherence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20929v1)

Authors: Sean C. Borneman, Julia Krebs, Ronnie B. Wilbur, Evie A. Malaia

Human language processing relies on the brain's capacity for predictive inference. We present a machine learning framework for decoding neural (EEG) responses to dynamic visual language stimuli in Deaf signers. Using coherence between neural signals and optical flow-derived motion features, we construct spatiotemporal representations of predictive neural dynamics. Through entropy-based feature selection, we identify frequency-specific neural signatures that differentiate interpretable linguistic input from linguistically disrupted (time-reversed) stimuli. Our results reveal distributed left-hemispheric and frontal low-frequency coherence as key features in language comprehension, with experience-dependent neural signatures correlating with age. This work demonstrates a novel multimodal approach for probing experience-driven generative models of perception in the brain.

We introduce the Nemotron 3 family of models - Nano, Super, and Ultra. These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference. Super is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads such as IT ticket automation. Ultra, the largest model, provides state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance. Nano is released together with its technical report and this white paper, while Super and Ultra will follow in the coming months. We will openly release the model weights, pre- and post-training software, recipes, and all data for which we hold redistribution rights.

### 6. [C2LLM Technical Report: A New Frontier in Code Retrieval via Adaptive Cross-Attention Pooling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21332v1)

Authors: Jin Qin, Zihan Liao, Ziyin Zhang, Hang Yu, Peng Di, Rui Wang

We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.

### 7. [ClarifyMT-Bench: Benchmarking and Improving Multi-Turn Clarification for Conversational Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21120v1)

Authors: Sichun Luo, Yi Huang, Mukai Li, Shichang Meng, Fengyuan Liu, Zefa Hu, Junlan Feng, Qi Liu

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

### 8. [Beyond Context: Large Language Models Failure to Grasp Users Intent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21110v1)

Authors: Ahmed M. Hussain, Salahuddin Salahuddin, Panos Papadimitratos

Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

### 9. [Parallel Token Prediction for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21323v1)

Authors: Felix Draxler, Justus Will, Farrin Marouf Sofian, Theofanis Karaletsos, Sameer Singh, Stephan Mandt

We propose Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), a universal framework for parallel sequence generation in language models. PTP jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating the sampling procedure into the model. This reduces the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding, and avoids the restrictive independence assumptions common in existing multi-token prediction methods. We prove that PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions. PTP is trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher. Experimentally, we achieve state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B by accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench. The universality of our framework indicates that parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power.

Authors: Shelly Schwartz, Oleg Vasilyev, Randy Sawaya

In realistic retrieval settings with large and evolving knowledge bases, the total number of documents relevant to a query is typically unknown, and recall cannot be computed. In this paper, we evaluate several established strategies for handling this limitation by measuring the correlation between retrieval quality metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality, where responses are generated from the retrieved documents. We conduct experiments across multiple datasets with a relatively low number of relevant documents (2-15). We also introduce a simple retrieval quality measure that performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.

### Cryptography and Security

### 1. [AutoBaxBuilder: Bootstrapping Code Security Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21132v1)

Authors: Tobias von Arx, Niels Mündler, Mark Vero, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev

As LLMs see wide adoption in software engineering, the reliable assessment of the correctness and security of LLM-generated code is crucial. Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.

### 2. [zkFL-Health: Blockchain-Enabled Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning for Medical AI Privacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21048v1)

Authors: Savvy Sharma, George Petrovic, Sarthak Kaushik

Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

### 3. [AegisAgent: An Autonomous Defense Agent Against Prompt Injection Attacks in LLM-HARs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20986v1)

Authors: Yihan Wang, Huanqi Yang, Shantanu Pal, Weitao Xu

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into wearable sensing is creating a new class of mobile applications capable of nuanced human activity understanding. However, the reliability of these systems is critically undermined by their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, where attackers deliberately input deceptive instructions into LLMs. Traditional defenses, based on static filters and rigid rules, are insufficient to address the semantic complexity of these new attacks. We argue that a paradigm shift is needed -- from passive filtering to active protection and autonomous reasoning. We introduce AegisAgent, an autonomous agent system designed to ensure the security of LLM-driven HAR systems. Instead of merely blocking threats, AegisAgent functions as a cognitive guardian. It autonomously perceives potential semantic inconsistencies, reasons about the user's true intent by consulting a dynamic memory of past interactions, and acts by generating and executing a multi-step verification and repair plan. We implement AegisAgent as a lightweight, full-stack prototype and conduct a systematic evaluation on 15 common attacks with five state-of-the-art LLM-based HAR systems on three public datasets. Results show it reduces attack success rate by 30\% on average while incurring only 78.6 ms of latency overhead on a GPU workstation. Our work makes the first step towards building secure and trustworthy LLM-driven HAR systems.

### 4. [Neutralization of IMU-Based GPS Spoofing Detection using external IMU sensor and feedback methodology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20964v1)

Authors: Ji Hyuk Jung, Ji Won Yoon

Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) refer to systems capable of perceiving their states and moving without human intervention. Among the factors required for autonomous decision-making in mobility, positional awareness of the vehicle itself is the most critical. Accordingly, extensive research has been conducted on defense mechanisms against GPS spoofing attacks, which threaten AVs by disrupting position recognition. Among these, detection methods based on internal IMU sensors are regarded as some of the most effective. In this paper, we propose a spoofing attack system designed to neutralize IMU sensor-based detection. First, we present an attack modeling approach for bypassing such detection. Then, based on EKF sensor fusion, we experimentally analyze both the impact of GPS spoofing values on the internal target system and how our proposed methodology reduces anomaly detection within the target system. To this end, this paper proposes an attack model that performs GPS spoofing by stealing internal dynamic state information using an external IMU sensor, and the experimental results demonstrate that attack values can be injected without being detected.

### 6. [Industrial Ouroboros: Deep Lateral Movement via Living Off the Plant](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21248v1)

Authors: Richard Derbyshire

Lateral movement is a tactic that adversaries employ most frequently in enterprise IT environments to traverse between assets. In operational technology (OT) environments, however, few methods exist for lateral movement between domain-specific devices, particularly programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Existing techniques often rely on complex chains of vulnerabilities, which are noisy and can be patched. This paper describes the first PLC-centric lateral movement technique that relies exclusively on the native functionality of the victim environment. This OT-specific form of `living off the land' is herein distinguished as `living off the plant' (LOTP). The described technique also facilitates escape from IP networks onto legacy serial networks via dual-homed PLCs. Furthermore, this technique is covert, leveraging common network communication functions that are challenging to detect. This serves as a reminder of the risks posed by LOTP techniques within OT, highlighting the need for a fundamental reconsideration of traditional OT defensive practices.

### 7. [Assessing the Software Security Comprehension of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21238v1)

Authors: Mohammed Latif Siddiq, Natalie Sekerak, Antonio Karam, Maria Leal, Arvin Islam-Gomes, Joanna C. S. Santos

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, but their level of software security expertise remains unclear. This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.

### 8. [Casting a SPELL: Sentence Pairing Exploration for LLM Limitation-breaking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21236v1)

Authors: Yifan Huang, Xiaojun Jia, Wenbo Guo, Yuqiang Sun, Yihao Huang, Chong Wang, Yang Liu

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.

Authors: Srijani Das, Manasi Patra, Tuhin Paul, Anish Majumdar, Ramij Rahaman

Anonymity is a fundamental cryptographic primitive that hides the identities of both senders and receivers during message transmission over a network. Classical protocols cannot provide information-theoretic security for such task, and existing quantum approaches typically depend on classical subroutines and multiple private channels, thereby weakening their security in fully adversarial settings. In this work, we introduce the first fully quantum protocol for anonymous communication in realistic quantum networks with a device-independent security proof.

### 10. [A Note on Publicly Verifiable Quantum Money with Low Quantum Computational Resources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21304v1)

Authors: Fabrizio Genovese, Lev Stambler

In this work we present a publicly verifiable quantum money protocol which assumes close to no quantum computational capabilities. We rely on one-time memories which in turn can be built from quantum conjugate coding and hardware-based assumptions. Specifically, our scheme allows for a limited number of verifications and also allows for quantum tokens for digital signatures. Double spending is prevented by the no-cloning principle of conjugate coding states. An implementation of the concepts presented in this work can be found at https://github.com/neverlocal/otm_billz.

### Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

### 1. [UniPR-3D: Towards Universal Visual Place Recognition with Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21078v1)

Authors: Tianchen Deng, Xun Chen, Ziming Li, Hongming Shen, Danwei Wang, Javier Civera, Hesheng Wang

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has been traditionally formulated as a single-image retrieval task. Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR. Our code and models will be made publicly available on Github https://github.com/dtc111111/UniPR-3D.

### 2. [Language-Guided Grasp Detection with Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21065v1)

Authors: Zebin Jiang, Tianle Jin, Xiangtong Yao, Alois Knoll, Hu Cao

Grasping is one of the most fundamental challenging capabilities in robotic manipulation, especially in unstructured, cluttered, and semantically diverse environments. Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

### 3. [Beyond Pixel Simulation: Pathology Image Generation via Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and Prototype Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21058v1)

Authors: Minghao Han, YiChen Liu, Yizhou Liu, Zizhi Chen, Jingqun Tang, Xuecheng Wu, Dingkang Yang, Lihua Zhang

In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.

### 4. [Optical Flow-Guided 6DoF Object Pose Tracking with an Event Camera](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21053v1)

Authors: Zibin Liu, Banglei Guan, Yang Shang, Shunkun Liang, Zhenbao Yu, Qifeng Yu

Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

### 5. [Matrix Completion Via Reweighted Logarithmic Norm Minimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21050v1)

Authors: Zhijie Wang, Liangtian He, Qinghua Zhang, Jifei Miao, Liang-Jian Deng, Jun Liu

Low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) has demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of applications. To address the NP-hard nature of the rank minimization problem, the nuclear norm is commonly used as a convex and computationally tractable surrogate for the rank function. However, this approach often yields suboptimal solutions due to the excessive shrinkage of singular values. In this letter, we propose a novel reweighted logarithmic norm as a more effective nonconvex surrogate, which provides a closer approximation than many existing alternatives. We efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem by employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on image inpainting demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LRMC approaches, both in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Authors: Xiangzuo Wu, Chengwei Ren, Jun Zhou, Xiu Li, Yuan Liu

Multi-view inverse rendering aims to recover geometry, materials, and illumination consistently across multiple viewpoints. When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery.

Authors: Zhi-Song Liu, Chenhang He, Roland Maier, Andreas Rupp

Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling. In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

Authors: Yingying Wang, Rongjin Zhuang, Hui Zheng, Xuanhua He, Ke Cao, Xiaotong Tu, Xinghao Ding

Image fusion integrates complementary information from different modalities to generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Unlike task-specific techniques that primarily focus on consolidating inter-modal information, general image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity. To achieve this, we propose SMC-Mamba, a Self-supervised Multiplex Consensus Mamba framework for general image fusion. Specifically, the Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module preserves fine details through adaptive gating and enhances global representations via spatial-channel and frequency-rotational scanning. The Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module enables dynamic collaboration among experts, reaching a consensus to efficiently integrate complementary information from multiple modalities. The cross-modal scanning within MCCM further strengthens feature interactions across modalities, facilitating seamless integration of critical information from both sources. Additionally, we introduce a Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL), which preserves high-frequency information without increasing computational overhead while simultaneously boosting performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion algorithms in tasks such as infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, as well as downstream visual tasks.

Authors: Zifu Zhang, Tongda Xu, Siqi Li, Shengxi Li, Yue Zhang, Mai Xu, Yan Wang

With the rapid development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the growing demand for their applications, efficient compression of the image inputs has become increasingly important. Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.

### 10. [Beyond Memorization: A Multi-Modal Ordinal Regression Benchmark to Expose Popularity Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21337v1)

Authors: Li-Zhong Szu-Tu, Ting-Lin Wu, Chia-Jui Chang, He Syu, Yu-Lun Liu

We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding. To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

Authors: Ahmed M. Hussain, Salahuddin Salahuddin, Panos Papadimitratos

Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

Authors: Nadine Aburumman, Ju-Ling Shih, Cigdem Sengul, Monica Pereira

This paper presents Microtopia, an interdisciplinary programme designed to broaden participation in computer science (CS) among ethnic minority girls. The programme combined coding with design thinking activities, incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Robotics as key technologies. Learning activities were formulated around the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Chinese Five Elements philosophy to support problem-based learning. Pupils were organised into "nations" and engaged in sector-based projects (e.g., healthcare, transportation, fashion, tourism, food, architecture). Using pre- and post-questionnaires, we investigated how socioeconomic and ethnocultural factors influenced pupils' preconceptions of CS, and whether participation in Microtopia shifted their perceptions. Through statistical analysis of the questionnaire data, we identified significant increases in students' confidence, enjoyment, and motivation, particularly when computing was presented as relevant to sustainability and global challenges.

Authors: Shang Chieh Lee, Bhuva Narayan, Simon Buckingham Shum, Stella Ng, A. Baki Kocaballi

Research on the implementation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in higher education often focuses on strategic goals, overlooking the hidden, and often politically charged, labour required to make it functional. This paper provides an insider's account of the sociotechnical friction that arises when an institutional goal of empowering non-technical staff conflicts with the technical limitations of enterprise Large Language Models (LLMs). Through analytic autoethnography, this study examines a GenAI project pushed to an impasse, focusing on a workaround developed to navigate not only technical constraints but also the combined challenge of organisational territoriality and assertions of positional power. Drawing upon Alter's (2014) theory of workarounds, the analysis interprets "articulation work" as a form of "invisible labour". By engaging with the Information Systems (IS) domains of user innovation and technology-in-practice, this study argues that such user-driven workarounds should be understood not as deviations, but as integral acts of sociotechnical integration. This integration, however, highlights the central paradoxes of modern GenAI where such workarounds for "unfinished" systems can simultaneously create unofficial "shadow" systems and obscure the crucial, yet invisible, sociotechnical labour involved. The findings suggest that the invisible labour required to integrate GenAI within complex organisational politics is an important, rather than peripheral, component of how it becomes functional in practice.

### 1. [An Allele-Centric Pan-Graph-Matrix Representation for Scalable Pangenome Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21320v1)

Authors: Roberto Garrone

Population-scale pangenome analysis increasingly requires representations that unify single-nucleotide and structural variation while remaining scalable across large cohorts. Existing formats are typically sequence-centric, path-centric, or sample-centric, and often obscure population structure or fail to exploit carrier sparsity. We introduce the H1 pan-graph-matrix, an allele-centric representation that encodes exact haplotype membership using adaptive per-allele compression. By treating alleles as first-class objects and selecting optimal encodings based on carrier distribution, H1 achieves near-optimal storage across both common and rare variants. We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs. H1 provides a unified, population-aware foundation for scalable pangenome analysis and downstream applications such as rare-variant interpretation and drug discovery.

Authors: YuK-Kwan Wong, Tuan-An To, Jipeng Zhang, Ziqiang Zheng, Sai-Kit Yeung

We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/

Authors: Savvy Sharma, George Petrovic, Sarthak Kaushik

Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

### 2. [Declarative distributed broadcast using three-valued modal logic and semitopologies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21137v1)

Authors: Murdoch J. Gabbay

We demonstrate how to formally specify distributed algorithms as declarative axiomatic theories in a modal logic. We exhibit the method on a simple voting protocol, a simple broadcast protocol, and a simple agreement protocol. The methods scale well and have been used to find errors in a proposed industrial protocol. The key novelty is to use modal logic to capture a declarative, high-level representation of essential system properties -- the logical essence of the algorithm -- while abstracting away from transitions of an abstract machine that implements it. It is like the difference between specifying code in a functional or logic programming language, versus specifying code in an imperative one.
  A logical axiomatisation in the style we propose provides a precise, compact, human-readable specification that abstractly captures essential system properties, while eliding low-level implementation details; it is more precise than a natural language description, yet more abstract than source code or a logical specification thereof. This creates new opportunities for reasoning about correctness, resilience, and failure, and could serve as a foundation for human- and machine verification efforts, design improvements, and even alternative protocol implementations.

Authors: S. M. Shovan, Arindam Khanda, Sanjukta Bhowmick, Sajal K. Das

Higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships in large complex networks are often modeled as hypergraphs. Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.

Authors: Sirui Chen, Jingji Chen, Siqi Zhu, Ziheng Jiang, Yanghua Peng, Xuehai Qian

Distributed attention is a fundamental problem for scaling context window for Large Language Models (LLMs). The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.
  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention.

### 5. [Deadline-Aware Online Scheduling for LLM Fine-Tuning with Spot Market Predictions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20967v1)

Authors: Linggao Kong, Yuedong Xu, Lei Jiao, Chuan Xu

As foundation models grow in size, fine-tuning them becomes increasingly expensive. While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Experimental results demonstrate that our online framework can adaptively select the best policy under varying spot market dynamics and prediction quality, consistently outperforming baselines and improving utility by up to 54.8\%.

Authors: Yuxiao Wang, Yuedong Xu, Qingyang Duan, Yuxuan Liu, Lei Jiao, Yinghao Yu, Jun Wu

The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and the continuous release of new GPU products have significantly increased the demand for distributed training across heterogeneous GPU environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.

Authors: Zhe Wang, Jinghang Li, Yifei Zhu

Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.

### 8. [Stochastic well-structured transition systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20939v1)

Authors: James Aspnes

Extending well-structured transition systems to incorporate a probabilistic scheduling rule, we define a new class of stochastic well-structured transition systems that includes population protocols, chemical reaction networks, and many common gossip models; as well as augmentations of these systems by an oracle that exposes a total order on agents as in population protocols in the comparison model or an equivalence relation as in population protocols with unordered data.
  We show that any implementation of a phase clock in these systems either stops or ticks too fast after polynomially many expected steps, and that any terminating computation in these systems finishes or fails in expected polynomial time. This latter property allows an exact characterization of the computational power of many stochastic well-structured transition systems augmented with a total order or equivalence relation on agents, showing that these compute exactly the languages in BPP, while the corresponding unaugmented systems compute just the symmetric languages in BPL.

Authors: Mohammadreza Daneshvaramoli, Helia Karisani, Mohammad Hajiesmaili, Shahin Kamali, Cameron Musco

We initiate a formal study of fairness for the $k$-server problem, where the objective is not only to minimize the total movement cost, but also to distribute the cost equitably among servers. We first define a general notion of $(α,β)$-fairness, where, for parameters $α\ge 1$ and $β\ge 0$, no server incurs more than an $α/k$-fraction of the total cost plus an additive term $β$. We then show that fairness can be achieved without a loss in competitiveness in both the offline and online settings. In the offline setting, we give a deterministic algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, transforms any optimal solution into an $(α,β)$-fair solution for $α= 1 + \varepsilon$ and $β= O(\mathrm{diam} \cdot \log k / \varepsilon)$, while increasing the cost of the solution by just an additive $O(\mathrm{diam} \cdot k \log k / \varepsilon)$ term. Here $\mathrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the underlying metric space. We give a similar result in the online setting, showing that any competitive algorithm can be transformed into a randomized online algorithm that is fair with high probability against an oblivious adversary and still competitive up to a small loss.
  The above results leave open a significant question: can fairness be achieved in the online setting, either with a deterministic algorithm or a randomized algorithm, against a fully adaptive adversary? We make progress towards answering this question, showing that the classic deterministic Double Coverage Algorithm (DCA) is fair on line metrics and on tree metrics when $k = 2$. However, we also show a negative result: DCA fails to be fair for any non-vacuous parameters on general tree metrics.

Authors: Meike Neuwohner, Vera Traub, Rico Zenklusen

Finding a smallest subgraph that is k-edge-connected, or augmenting a k-edge-connected graph with a smallest subset of given candidate edges to become (k+1)-edge-connected, are among the most fundamental Network Design problems. They are both APX-hard in general graphs. However, this hardness does not carry over to the planar setting, which is not well understood, except for very small values of k. One main obstacle in using standard decomposition techniques for planar graphs, like Baker's technique and extensions thereof, is that connectivity requirements are global (rather than local) properties that are not captured by existing frameworks.
  We present a novel, and arguably clean, decomposition technique for such classical connectivity problems on planar graphs. This technique immediately implies PTASs for the problems of finding a smallest k-edge-connected or k-vertex-connected spanning subgraph of a planar graph for arbitrary k. By leveraging structural results for minimally k-edge-connected graphs, we further obtain a PTAS for planar k-connectivity augmentation for any constant k. We complement this with an NP-hardness result, showing that our results are essentially optimal.

Authors: Shaun Scovil, Bhargav Chickmagalur Nanjundappa

Fungible tokens with time-to-live (TTL) semantics require tracking individual expiration times for each deposited unit. A naive implementation creates a new balance record per deposit, leading to unbounded storage growth and vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks. We present time-bucketed balance records, a data structure that bounds storage to O(k) records per account while guaranteeing that tokens never expire before their configured TTL. Our approach discretizes time into k buckets, coalescing deposits within the same bucket to limit unique expiration timestamps. We prove three key properties: (1) storage is bounded by k+1 records regardless of deposit frequency, (2) actual expiration time is always at least the configured TTL, and (3) adversaries cannot increase a victim's operation cost beyond O(k)[amortized] worst case. We provide a reference implementation in Solidity with measured gas costs demonstrating practical efficiency.

We present an extension of the in-place BWT algorithm of Crochemore et al. [8] that enables the construction of the Lyndon array using O(1) extra space. Our approach incrementally maintains the lexicographic ranks of the suffixes during the right-to-left BWT construction and then derives the Lyndon array through a simple next-smaller-value procedure. Although not intended for practical use due to its quadratic running time, the method is conceptually simple and works for unbounded alphabets.

Experimentally it's accuracy increases faster than linearly with the solution size $k$. Problems with $k=10^3$ are solved with an average maximum fractional error of $10^{-4}$ and problems with $k=10^5$ with an average maximum fractional error of $10^{-7}$. The algorithm runs in constant time for all problems with a given $n$. On a common desktop computer the algorithm processes $n=10^3$ problems in $10^{-3}$ seconds and $n=10^6$ problems in 2 seconds.

We first define a general notion of $(α,β)$-fairness, where, for parameters $α\ge 1$ and $β\ge 0$, no server incurs more than an $α/k$-fraction of the total cost plus an additive term $β$. We then show that fairness can be achieved without a loss in competitiveness in both the offline and online settings. In the offline setting, we give a deterministic algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, transforms any optimal solution into an $(α,β)$-fair solution for $α= 1 + \varepsilon$ and $β= O(\mathrm{diam} \cdot \log k / \varepsilon)$, while increasing the cost of the solution by just an additive $O(\mathrm{diam} \cdot k \log k / \varepsilon)$ term. Here $\mathrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the underlying metric space. We give a similar result in the online setting, showing that any competitive algorithm can be transformed into a randomized online algorithm that is fair with high probability against an oblivious adversary and still competitive up to a small loss.
  The above results leave open a significant question: can fairness be achieved in the online setting, either with a deterministic algorithm or a randomized algorithm, against a fully adaptive adversary? We make progress towards answering this question, showing that the classic deterministic Double Coverage Algorithm (DCA) is fair on line metrics and on tree metrics when $k = 2$. However, we also show a negative result: DCA fails to be fair for any non-vacuous parameters on general tree metrics.

### 1. [TexAvatars : Hybrid Texel-3D Representations for Stable Rigging of Photorealistic Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21099v1)

Authors: Jaeseong Lee, Junyeong Ahn, Taewoong Kang, Jaegul Choo

Constructing drivable and photorealistic 3D head avatars has become a central task in AR/XR, enabling immersive and expressive user experiences. With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings.

### 2. [A Design Study Process Model for Medical Visualization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21034v1)

Authors: Mengjie Fan, Liang Zhou

We introduce a design study process model for medical visualization based on the analysis of existing medical visualization and visual analysis works, and our own interdisciplinary research experience. With a literature review of related works covering various data types and applications, we identify features of medical visualization and visual analysis research and formulate our model thereafter. Compared to previous design study process models, our new model emphasizes: distinguishing between different stakeholders and target users before initiating specific designs, distinguishing design stages according to analytic logic or cognitive habits, and classifying task types as inferential or descriptive, and further hypothesis-based or hypothesis-free based on whether they involve multiple subgroups. In addition, our model refines previous models according to the characteristics of medical problems and provides referable guidance for each step. These improvements make the visualization design targeted, generalizable, and operational, which can adapt to the complexity and diversity of medical problems. We apply this model to guide the design of a visual analysis method and reanalyze three medical visualization-related works. These examples suggest that the new process model can provide a systematic theoretical framework and practical guidance for interdisciplinary medical visualization research. We give recommendations that future researchers can refer to, report on reflections on the model, and delineate it from existing models.

### 3. [Efficient Computation of Integer-constrained Cones for Conformal Parameterizations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20904v1)

Authors: Wei Du, Qing Fang, Ligang Liu, Xiao-Ming Fu

We propose an efficient method to compute a small set of integer-constrained cone singularities, which induce a rotationally seamless conformal parameterization with low distortion. Since the problem only involves discrete variables, i.e., vertex-constrained positions, integer-constrained angles, and the number of cones, we alternately optimize these three types of variables to achieve tractable convergence. Central to high efficiency is an explicit construction algorithm that reduces the optimization problem scale to be slightly greater than the number of integer variables for determining the optimal angles with fixed positions and numbers, even for high-genus surfaces. In addition, we derive a new derivative formula that allows us to move the cones, effectively reducing distortion until convergence. Combined with other strategies, including repositioning and adding cones to decrease distortion, adaptively selecting a constrained number of integer variables for efficient optimization, and pairing cones to reduce the number, we quickly achieve a favorable tradeoff between the number of cones and the parameterization distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of our cones by using them to generate rotationally seamless and low-distortion parameterizations on a massive test data set. Our method demonstrates an order-of-magnitude speedup (30$\times$ faster on average) compared to state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining comparable cone numbers and parameterization distortion.

### 4. [UltraShape 1.0: High-Fidelity 3D Shape Generation via Scalable Geometric Refinement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21185v1)

Authors: Tanghui Jia, Dongyu Yan, Dehao Hao, Yang Li, Kaiyi Zhang, Xianyi He, Lanjiong Li, Jinnan Chen, Lutao Jiang, Qishen Yin, Long Quan, Ying-Cong Chen, Li Yuan

In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research.

### 5. [AirGS: Real-Time 4D Gaussian Streaming for Free-Viewpoint Video Experiences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20943v1)

Authors: Zhe Wang, Jinghang Li, Yifei Zhu

Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.

### 1. [(Im)possibility of Incentive Design for Challenge-based Blockchain Protocols](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20864v1)

Authors: Suhyeon Lee, Dieu-Huyen Nguyen, Donghwan Lee

Blockchains offer a decentralized and secure execution environment strong enough to host cryptocurrencies, but the state-replication model makes on-chain computation expensive. To avoid heavy on-chain workloads, systems like Truebit and optimistic rollups use challenge-based protocols, performing computations off-chain and invoking the chain only when challenged. This keeps normal-case costs low and, if at least one honest challenger exists, can catch fraud. What has been less clear is whether honest challengers are actually incentivized and a dishonest proposer is properly damaged under the worst case environment. We build a model with a colluding minority, heterogeneous costs, and three ordering modes. We then ask whether two goals can be met together: honest non-loss and fraud deterrence. Our results are clear: in single-winner designs, the incentive design is impossible or limited in scale. By contrast, in multi-winner designs, we obtain simple, explicit conditions under which both goals hold.

### 2. [Policy-Conditioned Policies for Multi-Agent Task Solving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21024v1)

Authors: Yue Lin, Shuhui Zhu, Wenhao Li, Ang Li, Dan Qiao, Pascal Poupart, Hongyuan Zha, Baoxiang Wang

In multi-agent tasks, the central challenge lies in the dynamic adaptation of strategies. However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.

### 1. [Agentic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (Agentic XAI) Approach To Explore Better Explanation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21066v1)

Authors: Tomoaki Yamaguchi, Yutong Zhou, Masahiro Ryo, Keisuke Katsura

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

### 2. [From Human Bias to Robot Choice: How Occupational Contexts and Racial Priming Shape Robot Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20951v1)

Authors: Jiangen He, Wanqi Zhang, Jessica Barfield

As artificial agents increasingly integrate into professional environments, fundamental questions have emerged about how societal biases influence human-robot selection decisions. We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts. The results highlight mechanisms through which robotic deployment may unintentionally perpetuate existing social inequalities.

### 3. [Scaling Laws for Economic Productivity: Experimental Evidence in LLM-Assisted Consulting, Data Analyst, and Management Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21316v1)

Authors: Ali Merali

This paper derives `Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts' -- empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity. In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade.

Authors: Zijian Li, Luzhen Tang, Mengyu Xia, Xinyu Li, Naping Chen, Dragan Gašević, Yizhou Fan

With generative artificial intelligence driving the growth of dialogic data in education, automated coding is a promising direction for learning analytics to improve efficiency. This surge highlights the need to understand the nuances of student-AI interactions, especially those rare yet crucial. However, automated coding may struggle to capture these rare codes due to imbalanced data, while human coding remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. The current study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to approximate or replace humans in deductive, theory-driven coding, while also exploring how human-AI collaboration might support such coding tasks at scale. We compared the coding performance of small transformer classifiers (e.g., BERT) and LLMs in two datasets, with particular attention to imbalanced head-tail distributions in dialogue codes. Our results showed that LLMs did not outperform BERT-based models and exhibited systematic errors and biases in deductive coding tasks. We designed and evaluated a human-AI collaborative workflow that improved coding efficiency while maintaining coding reliability. Our findings reveal both the limitations of LLMs -- especially their difficulties with semantic similarity and theoretical interpretations and the indispensable role of human judgment -- while demonstrating the practical promise of human-AI collaborative workflows for coding.

### 6. [Learning Factors in AI-Augmented Education: A Comparative Study of Middle and High School Students](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21246v1)

Authors: Gaia Ebli, Bianca Raimondi, Maurizio Gabbrielli

The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.

### 7. [Making AI Work: An Autoethnography of a Workaround in Higher Education](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21055v1)

Authors: Shang Chieh Lee, Bhuva Narayan, Simon Buckingham Shum, Stella Ng, A. Baki Kocaballi

Research on the implementation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in higher education often focuses on strategic goals, overlooking the hidden, and often politically charged, labour required to make it functional. This paper provides an insider's account of the sociotechnical friction that arises when an institutional goal of empowering non-technical staff conflicts with the technical limitations of enterprise Large Language Models (LLMs). Through analytic autoethnography, this study examines a GenAI project pushed to an impasse, focusing on a workaround developed to navigate not only technical constraints but also the combined challenge of organisational territoriality and assertions of positional power. Drawing upon Alter's (2014) theory of workarounds, the analysis interprets "articulation work" as a form of "invisible labour". By engaging with the Information Systems (IS) domains of user innovation and technology-in-practice, this study argues that such user-driven workarounds should be understood not as deviations, but as integral acts of sociotechnical integration. This integration, however, highlights the central paradoxes of modern GenAI where such workarounds for "unfinished" systems can simultaneously create unofficial "shadow" systems and obscure the crucial, yet invisible, sociotechnical labour involved. The findings suggest that the invisible labour required to integrate GenAI within complex organisational politics is an important, rather than peripheral, component of how it becomes functional in practice.

### 8. [DexAvatar: 3D Sign Language Reconstruction with Hand and Body Pose Priors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21054v1)

Authors: Kaustubh Kundu, Hrishav Bakul Barua, Lucy Robertson-Bell, Zhixi Cai, Kalin Stefanov

The trend in sign language generation is centered around data-driven generative methods that require vast amounts of precise 2D and 3D human pose data to achieve an acceptable generation quality. However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art. The official website of this work is: https://github.com/kaustesseract/DexAvatar.

### 9. [Pioneering Multimodal Emotion Recognition in the Era of Large Models: From Closed Sets to Open Vocabularies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20938v1)

Authors: Jing Han, Zhiqiang Gao, Shihao Gao, Jialing Liu, Hongyu Chen, Zixing Zhang, Björn W. Schuller

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multi- and cross-modal integration capabilities. However, their potential for fine-grained emotion understanding remains systematically underexplored. While open-vocabulary multimodal emotion recognition (MER-OV) has emerged as a promising direction to overcome the limitations of closed emotion sets, no comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs in this context currently exists. To address this, our work presents the first large-scale benchmarking study of MER-OV on the OV-MERD dataset, evaluating 19 mainstream MLLMs, including general-purpose, modality-specialized, and reasoning-enhanced architectures. Through systematic analysis of model reasoning capacity, fusion strategies, contextual utilization, and prompt design, we provide key insights into the capabilities and limitations of current MLLMs for MER-OV. Our evaluation reveals that a two-stage, trimodal (audio, video, and text) fusion approach achieves optimal performance in MER-OV, with video emerging as the most critical modality. We further identify a surprisingly narrow gap between open- and closed-source LLMs. These findings establish essential benchmarks and offer practical guidelines for advancing open-vocabulary and fine-grained affective computing, paving the way for more nuanced and interpretable emotion AI systems. Associated code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Authors: Muhtadin, Vincentius Gusti Putu A. B. M., Ahmad Zaini, Mauridhi Hery Purnomo, I Ketut Eddy Purnama, Chastine Fatichah

Traditional control interfaces for quadruped robots often impose a high barrier to entry, requiring specialized technical knowledge for effective operation. To address this, this paper presents a novel control framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intuitive, natural language-based navigation. We propose a distributed architecture where high-level instruction processing is offloaded to an external server to overcome the onboard computational constraints of the DeepRobotics Jueying Lite 3 platform. The system grounds LLM-generated plans into executable ROS navigation commands using real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, and Odometry). Experimental validation was conducted in a structured indoor environment across four distinct scenarios, ranging from single-room tasks to complex cross-zone navigation. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, achieving an aggregate success rate of over 90\% across all scenarios, validating the feasibility of offloaded LLM-based planning for autonomous quadruped deployment in real-world settings.

### 1. [How important is Recall for Measuring Retrieval Quality?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20854v1)

Authors: Shelly Schwartz, Oleg Vasilyev, Randy Sawaya

In realistic retrieval settings with large and evolving knowledge bases, the total number of documents relevant to a query is typically unknown, and recall cannot be computed. In this paper, we evaluate several established strategies for handling this limitation by measuring the correlation between retrieval quality metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality, where responses are generated from the retrieved documents. We conduct experiments across multiple datasets with a relatively low number of relevant documents (2-15). We also introduce a simple retrieval quality measure that performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.

### 2. [ClarifyMT-Bench: Benchmarking and Improving Multi-Turn Clarification for Conversational Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21120v1)

Authors: Sichun Luo, Yi Huang, Mukai Li, Shichang Meng, Fengyuan Liu, Zefa Hu, Junlan Feng, Qi Liu

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

Industrial recommender systems face two fundamental limitations under the log-driven paradigm: (1) knowledge poverty in ID-based item representations that causes brittle interest modeling under data sparsity, and (2) systemic blindness to beyond-log user interests that constrains model performance within platform boundaries. These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora.
  To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.

### 4. [Agentic Multi-Persona Framework for Evidence-Aware Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21039v1)

Authors: Roopa Bukke, Soumya Pandey, Suraj Kumar, Soumi Chattopadhyay, Chandranath Adak

The rapid proliferation of online misinformation poses significant risks to public trust, policy, and safety, necessitating reliable automated fake news detection. Existing methods often struggle with multimodal content, domain generalization, and explainability. We propose AMPEND-LS, an agentic multi-persona evidence-grounded framework with LLM-SLM synergy for multimodal fake news detection. AMPEND-LS integrates textual, visual, and contextual signals through a structured reasoning pipeline powered by LLMs, augmented with reverse image search, knowledge graph paths, and persuasion strategy analysis. To improve reliability, we introduce a credibility fusion mechanism combining semantic similarity, domain trustworthiness, and temporal context, and a complementary SLM classifier to mitigate LLM uncertainty and hallucinations. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMPEND-LS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, F1 score, and robustness. Qualitative case studies further highlight its transparent reasoning and resilience against evolving misinformation. This work advances the development of adaptive, explainable, and evidence-aware systems for safeguarding online information integrity.

### 5. [Accurate and Diverse Recommendations via Propensity-Weighted Linear Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20896v1)

Authors: Kazuma Onishi, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Hidetaka Kamigaito

In real-world recommender systems, user-item interactions are Missing Not At Random (MNAR), as interactions with popular items are more frequently observed than those with less popular ones. Missing observations shift recommendations toward frequently interacted items, which reduces the diversity of the recommendation list. To alleviate this problem, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) is widely used and commonly models propensities based on a power-law function of item interaction frequency. However, we found that such power-law-based correction overly penalizes popular items and harms their recommendation performance. We address this issue by redefining the propensity score to allow broader item recommendation without excessively penalizing popular items. The proposed score is formulated by applying a sigmoid function to the logarithm of the item observation frequency, maintaining the simplicity of power-law scoring while allowing for more flexible adjustment. Furthermore, we incorporate the redefined propensity score into a linear autoencoder model, which tends to favor popular items, and evaluate its effectiveness. Experimental results revealed that our method substantially improves the diversity of items in the recommendation list without sacrificing recommendation accuracy.

Authors: Mohammad Mahdi Abootorabi, Alireza Ghahramani Kure, Mohammadali Mohammadkhani, Sina Elahimanesh, Mohammad Ali Ali Panah

This paper presents our system for SemEval-2025 Task 7: Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval. In an era where misinformation spreads rapidly, effective fact-checking is increasingly critical. We introduce TriAligner, a novel approach that leverages a dual-encoder architecture with contrastive learning and incorporates both native and English translations across different modalities. Our method effectively retrieves claims across multiple languages by learning the relative importance of different sources in alignment. To enhance robustness, we employ efficient data preprocessing and augmentation using large language models while incorporating hard negative sampling to improve representation learning. We evaluate our approach on monolingual and crosslingual benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and fact-checking performance over baselines.

### 7. [MMSRARec: Summarization and Retrieval Augumented Sequential Recommendation Based on Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20916v1)

Authors: Haoyu Wang, Yitong Wang, Jining Wang

Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in recommendation systems. However, the effective application of MLLMs to multimodal sequential recommendation remains unexplored: A) Existing methods primarily leverage the multimodal semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained MLLMs to generate item embeddings or semantic IDs, thereby enhancing traditional recommendation models. These approaches generate item representations that exhibit limited interpretability, and pose challenges when transferring to language model-based recommendation systems. B) Other approaches convert user behavior sequence into image-text pairs and perform recommendation through multiple MLLM inference, incurring prohibitive computational and time costs. C) Current MLLM-based recommendation systems generally neglect the integration of collaborative signals. To address these limitations while balancing recommendation performance, interpretability, and computational cost, this paper proposes MultiModal Summarization-and-Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, we first employ MLLM to summarize items into concise keywords and fine-tune the model using rewards that incorporate summary length, information loss, and reconstruction difficulty, thereby enabling adaptive adjustment of the summarization policy. Inspired by retrieval-augmented generation, we then transform collaborative signals into corresponding keywords and integrate them as supplementary context. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning with multi-task learning to align the MLLM with the multimodal sequential recommendation. Extensive evaluations on common recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MMSRARec, showcasing its capability to efficiently and interpretably understand user behavior histories and item information for accurate recommendations.

### 8. [Blurb-Refined Inference from Crowdsourced Book Reviews using Hierarchical Genre Mining with Dual-Path Graph Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21076v1)

Authors: Suraj Kumar, Utsav Kumar Nareti, Soumi Chattopadhyay, Chandranath Adak, Prolay Mallick

Accurate book genre classification is fundamental to digital library organization, content discovery, and personalized recommendation. Existing approaches typically model genre prediction as a flat, single-label task, ignoring hierarchical genre structure and relying heavily on noisy, subjective user reviews, which often degrade classification reliability. We propose HiGeMine, a two-phase hierarchical genre mining framework that robustly integrates user reviews with authoritative book blurbs. In the first phase, HiGeMine employs a zero-shot semantic alignment strategy to filter reviews, retaining only those semantically consistent with the corresponding blurb, thereby mitigating noise, bias, and irrelevance. In the second phase, we introduce a dual-path, two-level graph-based classification architecture: a coarse-grained Level-1 binary classifier distinguishes fiction from non-fiction, followed by Level-2 multi-label classifiers for fine-grained genre prediction. Inter-genre dependencies are explicitly modeled using a label co-occurrence graph, while contextual representations are derived from pretrained language models applied to the filtered textual content. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we curate a new hierarchical book genre dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGeMine consistently outperformed strong baselines across hierarchical genre classification tasks. The proposed framework offers a principled and effective solution for leveraging both structured and unstructured textual data in hierarchical book genre analysis.

### 9. [Towards Better Search with Domain-Aware Text Embeddings for C2C Marketplaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21021v1)

Authors: Andre Rusli, Miao Cao, Shoma Ishimoto, Sho Akiyama, Max Frenzel

Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces pose distinct retrieval challenges: short, ambiguous queries; noisy, user-generated listings; and strict production constraints. This paper reports our experiment to build a domain-aware Japanese text-embedding approach to improve the quality of search at Mercari, Japan's largest C2C marketplace. We experimented with fine-tuning on purchase-driven query-title pairs, using role-specific prefixes to model query-item asymmetry. To meet production constraints, we apply Matryoshka Representation Learning to obtain compact, truncation-robust embeddings. Offline evaluation on historical search logs shows consistent gains over a strong generic encoder, with particularly large improvements when replacing PCA compression with Matryoshka truncation. A manual assessment further highlights better handling of proper nouns, marketplace-specific semantics, and term-importance alignment. Additionally, an initial online A/B test demonstrates statistically significant improvements in revenue per user and search-flow efficiency, with transaction frequency maintained. Results show that domain-aware embeddings improve relevance and efficiency at scale and form a practical foundation for richer LLM-era search experiences.

### 1. [AutoBaxBuilder: Bootstrapping Code Security Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21132v1)

Authors: Tobias von Arx, Niels Mündler, Mark Vero, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev

As LLMs see wide adoption in software engineering, the reliable assessment of the correctness and security of LLM-generated code is crucial. Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.

### 2. [zkFL-Health: Blockchain-Enabled Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning for Medical AI Privacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21048v1)

Authors: Savvy Sharma, George Petrovic, Sarthak Kaushik

Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

### 3. [Learning from Neighbors with PHIBP: Predicting Infectious Disease Dynamics in Data-Sparse Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21005v1)

Authors: Edwin Fong, Lancelot F. James, Juho Lee

Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.

### 4. [Automatic Replication of LLM Mistakes in Medical Conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20983v1)

Authors: Oleksii Proniakin, Diego Fajardo, Ruslan Nazarenko, Razvan Marinescu

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

### 5. [Can Agentic AI Match the Performance of Human Data Scientists?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20959v1)

Authors: An Luo, Jin Du, Fangqiao Tian, Xun Xian, Robert Specht, Ganghua Wang, Xuan Bi, Charles Fleming, Jayanth Srinivasa, Ashish Kundu, Mingyi Hong, Jie Ding

Data science plays a critical role in transforming complex data into actionable insights across numerous domains. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.

### 6. [Guardrailed Elasticity Pricing: A Churn-Aware Forecasting Playbook for Subscription Strategy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20932v1)

Authors: Deepit Sapru

This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.

### 7. [From GNNs to Symbolic Surrogates via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Delay Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20885v1)

Authors: Sami Marouani, Kamal Singh, Baptiste Jeudy, Amaury Habrard

Accurate prediction of flow delay is essential for optimizing and managing modern communication networks. We investigate three levels of modeling for this task. First, we implement a heterogeneous GNN with attention-based message passing, establishing a strong neural baseline. Second, we propose FlowKANet in which Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks replace standard MLP layers, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining competitive predictive performance. FlowKANet integrates KAMP-Attn (Kolmogorov-Arnold Message Passing with Attention), embedding KAN operators directly into message-passing and attention computation. Finally, we distill the model into symbolic surrogate models using block-wise regression, producing closed-form equations that eliminate trainable weights while preserving graph-structured dependencies. The results show that KAN layers provide a favorable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy and that symbolic surrogates emphasize the potential for lightweight deployment and enhanced transparency.

We introduce the Nemotron 3 family of models - Nano, Super, and Ultra. These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference. Super is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads such as IT ticket automation. Ultra, the largest model, provides state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance. Nano is released together with its technical report and this white paper, while Super and Ultra will follow in the coming months. We will openly release the model weights, pre- and post-training software, recipes, and all data for which we hold redistribution rights.

### 9. [Variationally correct operator learning: Reduced basis neural operator with a posteriori error estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21319v1)

Authors: Yuan Qiu, Wolfgang Dahmen, Peng Chen

Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator.

### 10. [A Unified Framework for EEG Seizure Detection Using Universum-Integrated Generalized Eigenvalues Proximal Support Vector Machine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21170v1)

Authors: Yogesh Kumar, Vrushank Ahire, M. A. Ganaie

The paper presents novel Universum-enhanced classifiers: the Universum Generalized Eigenvalue Proximal Support Vector Machine (U-GEPSVM) and the Improved U-GEPSVM (IU-GEPSVM) for EEG signal classification. Using the computational efficiency of generalized eigenvalue decomposition and the generalization benefits of Universum learning, the proposed models address critical challenges in EEG analysis: non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited labeled data. U-GEPSVM extends the GEPSVM framework by incorporating Universum constraints through a ratio-based objective function, while IU-GEPSVM enhances stability through a weighted difference-based formulation that provides independent control over class separation and Universum alignment. The models are evaluated on the Bonn University EEG dataset across two binary classification tasks: (O vs S)-healthy (eyes closed) vs seizure, and (Z vs S)-healthy (eyes open) vs seizure. IU-GEPSVM achieves peak accuracies of 85% (O vs S) and 80% (Z vs S), with mean accuracies of 81.29% and 77.57% respectively, outperforming baseline methods.

Authors: Xudong Wang, Lei Feng, Ruichen Zhang, Fanqin Zhou, Hongyang Du, Wenjing Li, Dusit Niyato, Abbas Jamalipour, Ping Zhang

The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires networks that deliver ultra-low latency, high reliability, and cost efficiency, which traditional optimization methods and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approaches struggle to provide under dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. To address this gap, large language model (LLM)-empowered agentic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating reasoning, planning, and adaptation to enable QoE-aware network management. In this paper, we explore the integration of agentic AI into QoE-aware network slicing for IIoT. We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation. Through a case study on heterogeneous slice management, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baselines in balancing latency, reliability, and cost, and achieves up to a 19% improvement in slice availability ratio.

Authors: Siqi Mu, Shuo Wen, Yang Lu, Ruihong Jiang, Bo Ai

Due to their inherent flexibility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to provide real-time biomedical edge computing service for wireless body area network (WBAN) users. In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.

### 4. [Synecdoche: Efficient and Accurate In-Network Traffic Classification via Direct Packet Sequential Pattern Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21116v1)

Authors: Minyuan Xiao, Yunchun Li, Yuchen Zhao, Tong Guan, Mingyuan Xia, Wei Li

Traffic classification on programmable data plane holds great promise for line-rate processing, with methods evolving from per-packet to flow-level analysis for higher accuracy. However, a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency persists. Statistical feature-based methods align with hardware constraints but often exhibit limited accuracy, while online deep learning methods using packet sequential features achieve superior accuracy but require substantial computational resources. This paper presents Synecdoche, the first traffic classification framework that successfully deploys packet sequential features on a programmable data plane via pattern matching, achieving both high accuracy and efficiency. Our key insight is that discriminative information concentrates in short sub-sequences--termed Key Segments--that serve as compact traffic features for efficient data plane matching. Synecdoche employs an "offline discovery, online matching" paradigm: deep learning models automatically discover Key Segment patterns offline, which are then compiled into optimized table entries for direct data plane matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate Synecdoche's superior accuracy, improving F1-scores by up to 26.4% against statistical methods and 18.3% against online deep learning methods, while reducing latency by 13.0% and achieving 79.2% reduction in SRAM usage. The source code of Synecdoche is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

### 5. [Diving into 3D Parallelism with Heterogeneous Spot Instance GPUs: Design and Implications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20953v1)

Authors: Yuxiao Wang, Yuedong Xu, Qingyang Duan, Yuxuan Liu, Lei Jiao, Yinghao Yu, Jun Wu

The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and the continuous release of new GPU products have significantly increased the demand for distributed training across heterogeneous GPU environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.

### 6. [SLIDE: Simultaneous Model Downloading and Inference at the Wireless Network Edge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20946v1)

Authors: Guanqiao Qu, Tao Li, Qian Chen, Xianhao Chen, Sheng Zhou

To support on-device inference, the next-generation mobile networks are expected to support real-time model downloading services to mobile users. However, powerful AI models typically have large model sizes, resulting in excessive end-to-end (E2E) downloading-and-inference (DAI) latency. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous model downloading and inference (SLIDE) framework, which allows users to perform inference with downloaded layers while simultaneously receiving the remaining layers of the model. To this end, we formulate a task throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing model provisioning, spectrum bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation for multi-user downlink systems. Unlike traditional DAI frameworks, SLIDE introduces recursive dependencies across layers, where inference latency depends recursively on the downloading bandwidth and computing resource allocation for each of the preceding layers. To solve this challenging problem, we design an efficient algorithm that acquires the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SLIDE framework significantly improves task throughput under latency and communication resource constraints compared with the conventional model downloading schemes.

### 7. [Encrypted Traffic Detection in Resource Constrained IoT Networks: A Diffusion Model and LLM Integrated Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21144v1)

Authors: Hongjuan Li, Hui Kang, Chenbang Liu, Ruolin Wang, Jiahui Li, Geng Sun, Jiacheng Wang, Shuang Liang, Shiwen Mao

The proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) infrastructures and the widespread adoption of traffic encryption present significant challenges, particularly in environments characterized by dynamic traffic patterns, constrained computational capabilities, and strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\%, 92.61\%, and 99.83\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively. This improves classification accuracy by an average of 3.7\% and reduces training time by an average of 41.9\% compared to the representative deep learning model.

Authors: Zhe Wang, Jinghang Li, Yifei Zhu

Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.

Authors: Ece Bingöl, Eylem Ekici, Mehmet C. Vuran

The large bandwidths available at millimeter wave (mmWave) FR2 bands (24-71 GHz) and the emerging FR3 bands (7-24 GHz) are essential for supporting high data rates. Highly directional beams utilized to overcome the attenuation in these frequencies necessitate robust and efficient beamforming schemes. Nevertheless, antenna and beam management approaches still face challenges in highly mobile solutions, such as vehicular connectivity, with increasing number of bands. In this work, the concepts of spectrum mobility is studied along with antenna array management in multiple frequencies to improve beamforming under mobility. The spectrum mobility problem aims to select the optimal channel frequency and beam direction in each time slot to maximize data rate. This problem is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI) algorithm is used to find a policy with performance guarantees. Numerical examples confirm the efficacy of the resulting policy for multiple available frequency bands, even when the user mobility significantly deviates from models assumed during policy generation.

### 1. [Language-Guided Grasp Detection with Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21065v1)

Authors: Zebin Jiang, Tianle Jin, Xiangtong Yao, Alois Knoll, Hu Cao

Grasping is one of the most fundamental challenging capabilities in robotic manipulation, especially in unstructured, cluttered, and semantically diverse environments. Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

### 2. [Tracing Energy Flow: Learning Tactile-based Grasping Force Control to Prevent Slippage in Dynamic Object Interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21043v1)

Authors: Cheng-Yu Kuo, Hirofumi Shin, Takamitsu Matsubara

Regulating grasping force to reduce slippage during dynamic object interaction remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, especially when objects are manipulated by multiple rolling contacts, have unknown properties (such as mass or surface conditions), and when external sensing is unreliable. In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues. Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability. Building on this abstraction, we employ model-based learning and planning to efficiently model energy dynamics from tactile sensing and perform real-time grasping force optimization. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our method can learn grasping force control from scratch within minutes, effectively reduce slippage, and extend grasp duration across diverse motion-object pairs, all without relying on external sensing or prior object knowledge.

### 3. [Multimodal Sensing for Robot-Assisted Sub-Tissue Feature Detection in Physiotherapy Palpation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20992v1)

Authors: Tian-Ao Ren, Jorge Garcia, Seongheon Hong, Jared Grinberg, Hojung Choi, Julia Di, Hao Li, Dmitry Grinberg, Mark R. Cutkosky

Robotic palpation relies on force sensing, but force signals in soft-tissue environments are variable and cannot reliably reveal subtle subsurface features. We present a compact multimodal sensor that integrates high-resolution vision-based tactile imaging with a 6-axis force-torque sensor. In experiments on silicone phantoms with diverse subsurface tendon geometries, force signals alone frequently produce ambiguous responses, while tactile images reveal clear structural differences in presence, diameter, depth, crossings, and multiplicity. Yet accurate force tracking remains essential for maintaining safe, consistent contact during physiotherapeutic interaction. Preliminary results show that combining tactile and force modalities enables robust subsurface feature detection and controlled robotic palpation.

### 4. [From Human Bias to Robot Choice: How Occupational Contexts and Racial Priming Shape Robot Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20951v1)

Authors: Jiangen He, Wanqi Zhang, Jessica Barfield

As artificial agents increasingly integrate into professional environments, fundamental questions have emerged about how societal biases influence human-robot selection decisions. We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts. The results highlight mechanisms through which robotic deployment may unintentionally perpetuate existing social inequalities.

### 5. [Certifiable Alignment of GNSS and Local Frames via Lagrangian Duality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20931v1)

Authors: Baoshan Song, Matthew Giamou, Penggao Yan, Chunxi Xia, Li-Ta Hsu

Estimating the absolute orientation of a local system relative to a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reference often suffers from local minima and high dependency on satellite availability. Existing methods for this alignment task rely on abundant satellites unavailable in GNSS-degraded environments, or use local optimization methods which cannot guarantee the optimality of a solution. This work introduces a globally optimal solver that transforms raw pseudo-range or Doppler measurements into a convexly relaxed problem. The proposed method is certifiable, meaning it can numerically verify the correctness of the result, filling a gap where existing local optimizers fail. We first formulate the original frame alignment problem as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and relax the QCQP problem to a concave Lagrangian dual problem that provides a lower cost bound for the original problem. Then we perform relaxation tightness and observability analysis to derive criteria for certifiable optimality of the solution. Finally, simulation and real world experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experiments show that our method provides certifiably optimal solutions even with only 2 satellites with Doppler measurements and 2D vehicle motion, while the traditional velocity-based VOBA method and the advanced GVINS alignment technique may fail or converge to local optima without notice. To support the development of GNSS-based navigation techniques in robotics, all code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Baoshan-Song/Certifiable-Doppler-alignment.

Authors: Suvir Mirchandani, Mia Tang, Jiafei Duan, Jubayer Ibn Hamid, Michael Cho, Dorsa Sadigh

Imitation learning from human demonstrations has become a dominant approach for training autonomous robot policies. However, collecting demonstration datasets is costly: it often requires access to robots and needs sustained effort in a tedious, long process. These factors limit the scale of data available for training policies. We aim to address this scalability challenge by involving a broader audience in a gamified data collection experience that is both accessible and motivating. Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%). Further, we conduct a user study to validate that novice users find the gamified platform significantly more enjoyable than a standard non-gamified platform (+24%). These results highlight the promise of gamified data collection as a scalable, accessible, and engaging method for collecting demonstration data.

### 7. [RoboSafe: Safeguarding Embodied Agents via Executable Safety Logic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21220v1)

Authors: Le Wang, Zonghao Ying, Xiao Yang, Quanchen Zou, Zhenfei Yin, Tianlin Li, Jian Yang, Yaodong Yang, Aishan Liu, Xianglong Liu

Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

### 8. [Robust and Efficient MuJoCo-based Model Predictive Control via Web of Affine Spaces Derivatives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21109v1)

Authors: Chen Liang, Daniel Rakita

MuJoCo is a powerful and efficient physics simulator widely used in robotics. One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG. In addition, WASP-based MPC outperforms MJPC's stochastic sampling-based planners on our evaluation tasks, offering both greater efficiency and reliability. To support adoption and future research, we release an open-source implementation of MJPC with WASP derivatives fully integrated.

Authors: Anatoly O. Onishchenko, Alexey K. Kovalev, Aleksandr I. Panov

Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

### 10. [Schrödinger's Navigator: Imagining an Ensemble of Futures for Zero-Shot Object Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21201v1)

Authors: Yu He, Da Huang, Zhenyang Liu, Zixiao Gu, Qiang Sun, Guangnan Ye, Yanwei Fu

Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) requires a robot to locate a target object in a previously unseen environment without relying on pre-built maps or task-specific training. However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.

Authors: Zhaoxi Zhang, Yitong Duan, Yanzhi Zhang, Yiming Xu, Jiyan He, Yunfang Wu

Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.

Authors: Mohammed Latif Siddiq, Natalie Sekerak, Antonio Karam, Maria Leal, Arvin Islam-Gomes, Joanna C. S. Santos

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, but their level of software security expertise remains unclear. This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.

Authors: Yifan Huang, Xiaojun Jia, Wenbo Guo, Yuqiang Sun, Yihao Huang, Chong Wang, Yang Liu

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.

### 4. [Artificial or Just Artful? Do LLMs Bend the Rules in Programming?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21028v1)

Authors: Oussama Ben Sghaier, Kevin Delcourt, Houari Sahraoui

Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.

### 1. [A Community-Enhanced Graph Representation Model for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21166v1)

Authors: Lei Wang, Darong Lai

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for graph representation learning, their performance on link prediction tasks does not always surpass that of traditional heuristic methods such as Common Neighbors and Jaccard Coefficient. This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.

### 2. [Emotion Diffusion in Real and Simulated Social Graphs: Structural Limits of LLM-Based Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21138v1)

Authors: Qiqi Qiang

Understanding how emotions diffuse through social networks is central to computational social science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks. This work provides empirical evidence for the cautious use of LLM-generated data in social science research and suggests directions for improving future simulation frameworks.

Authors: Dino Husnic, Stefan Cobeli, Shweta Yadav

The COVID-19 pandemic has created many problems, especially in people's social lives. There has been increasing isolation and economic hardships since the beginning of the pandemic for people all over the world. Quarantines and lockdowns also took part in that, and so, people have been expressing their emotions throughout the pandemic period using social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. In this study, we seek to analyze the emotions and mental health labels throughout the time period of March 2, 2020, up until July 4, 2020, from the threads and comments gathered from the r/unitedkingdom subreddit. We used a soft labeling technique to generate mental health conditions for each Reddit comment. We compared the overall results with important dates related to COVID-19 policies that took place in the United Kingdom. This can give us a view on how the pandemic and the important dates affect people self disclosing their emotions on social media platforms. Finally, we have developed a proof of concept to show that using mental health features may increase emotion prediction accuracy.

### 1. [Learning from Neighbors with PHIBP: Predicting Infectious Disease Dynamics in Data-Sparse Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21005v1)

Authors: Edwin Fong, Lancelot F. James, Juho Lee

Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.

### 2. [Enhancing diffusion models with Gaussianization preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21020v1)

Authors: Li Cunzhi, Louis Kang, Hideaki Shimazaki

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks such as image generation. However, one of the bottlenecks of these models is slow sampling due to the delay before the onset of trajectory bifurcation, at which point substantial reconstruction begins. This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks. The proposed method is, in principle, applicable to a broad range of generative tasks, enabling more stable and efficient sampling processes.

### 3. [Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21326v1)

Authors: Sida Wang

Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.

Authors: Karl Friston, Lancelot Da Costa, Alexander Tschantz, Conor Heins, Christopher Buckley, Tim Verbelen, Thomas Parr

This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.

### 5. [Statistical and computational challenges in ranking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21111v1)

Authors: Alexandra Carpentier, Nicolas Verzelen

We consider the problem of ranking $n$ experts according to their abilities, based on the correctness of their answers to $d$ questions. This is modeled by the so-called crowd-sourcing model, where the answer of expert $i$ on question $k$ is modeled by a random entry, parametrized by $M_{i,k}$ which is increasing linearly with the expected quality of the answer. To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $π^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{π^{*-1}(i),k} \geq M_{π^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\in [n-1], k \in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $π^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $λ\mathbf 1\{S\times T\}$ where $S\subset [n], T\subset [d]$. This model has been extensively studied. We provide an overview of the results and proof techniques for this problem with a particular emphasis on the computational lower bounds based on low-degree polynomial methods. Then, we build upon this instrumental sub-problem to discuss existing results and algorithmic ideas for the general ranking problem.

A methodology is developed to extract $d$ invariant features $W=f(X)$ that predict a response variable $Y$ without being confounded by variables $Z$ that may influence both $X$ and $Y$.
  The methodology's main ingredient is the penalization of any statistical dependence between $W$ and $Z$ conditioned on $Y$, replaced by the more readily implementable plain independence between $W$ and the random variable $Z_Y = T(Z,Y)$ that solves the [Monge] Optimal Transport Barycenter Problem for $Z\mid Y$. In the Gaussian case considered in this article, the two statements are equivalent.
  When the true confounders $Z$ are unknown, other measurable contextual variables $S$ can be used as surrogates, a replacement that involves no relaxation in the Gaussian case if the covariance matrix $Σ_{ZS}$ has full range. The resulting linear feature extractor adopts a closed form in terms of the first $d$ eigenvectors of a known matrix. The procedure extends with little change to more general, non-Gaussian / non-linear cases.

### 7. [Understanding Scaling Laws in Deep Neural Networks via Feature Learning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21075v1)

Authors: Zihan Yao, Ruoyu Wu, Tianxiang Gao

The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to scaling laws that predict consistent gains as model, data, and compute grow; however, large models can exhibit training instability and diminishing returns, suggesting that scaling laws describe what success looks like but not when and why scaling succeeds or fails. A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.

### 8. [Does the Data Processing Inequality Reflect Practice? On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21315v1)

Authors: Roy Turgeman, Tom Tirer

The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform "low-level" tasks before "high-level" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.

### 9. [Causal-driven attribution (CDA): Estimating channel influence without user-level data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21211v1)

Authors: Georgios Filippou, Boi Mai Quach, Diana Lenghel, Arthur White, Ashish Kumar Jha

Attribution modelling lies at the heart of marketing effectiveness, yet most existing approaches depend on user-level path data, which are increasingly inaccessible due to privacy regulations and platform restrictions. This paper introduces a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that infers channel influence using only aggregated impression-level data, avoiding any reliance on user identifiers or click-path tracking. CDA integrates temporal causal discovery (using PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to recover directional channel relationships and quantify their contributions to conversions. Using large-scale synthetic data designed to replicate real marketing dynamics, we show that CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% when given the true causal graph, and 24.23% when using the predicted graph, demonstrating strong accuracy under correct structure and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty. CDA captures cross-channel interdependencies while providing interpretable, privacy-preserving attribution insights, offering a scalable and future-proof alternative to traditional path-based models.

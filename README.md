### 1. [Say It Differently: Linguistic Styles as Jailbreak Vectors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10519v1)

Authors: Srikant Panda, Avinash Rai

Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

### 2. [Scalable Synthesis of distributed LLM workloads through Symbolic Tensor Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10480v1)

Authors: Changhai Man, Joongun Park, Hanjiang Wu, Huan Xu, Srinivas Sridharan, Tushar Krishna

Optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on large-scale AI training and inference systems requires a scalable and expressive mechanism to model distributed workload execution. Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication. STAGE will be publicly available to facilitate further research in distributed machine learning systems.

### 3. [DermAI: Clinical dermatology acquisition through quality-driven image collection for AI classification in mobile](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10367v1)

Authors: Thales Bezerra, Emanoel Thyago, Kelvin Cunha, Rodrigo Abreu, Fábio Papais, Francisco Mauro, Natália Lopes, Érico Medeiros, Jéssica Guido, Shirley Cruz, Paulo Borba, Tsang Ing Ren

AI-based dermatology adoption remains limited by biased datasets, variable image quality, and limited validation. We introduce DermAI, a lightweight, smartphone-based application that enables real-time capture, annotation, and classification of skin lesions during routine consultations. Unlike prior dermoscopy-focused tools, DermAI performs on-device quality checks, and local model adaptation. The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance. These results highlight the importance of standardized, diverse data collection aligned with healthcare needs and oriented to machine learning development.

### 4. [Torch-Uncertainty: A Deep Learning Framework for Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10282v1)

Authors: Adrien Lafage, Olivier Laurent, Firas Gabetni, Gianni Franchi

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Although numerous techniques have been proposed, a unified tool offering a seamless workflow to evaluate and integrate these methods remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce Torch-Uncertainty, a PyTorch and Lightning-based framework designed to streamline DNN training and evaluation with UQ techniques and metrics. In this paper, we outline the foundational principles of our library and present comprehensive experimental results that benchmark a diverse set of UQ methods across classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Our library is available at https://github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/Torch-Uncertainty

### 5. [Bridging Synthetic and Real Routing Problems via LLM-Guided Instance Generation and Progressive Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10233v1)

Authors: Jianghan Zhu, Yaoxin Wu, Zhuoyi Lin, Zhengyuan Zhang, Haiyan Yin, Zhiguang Cao, Senthilnath Jayavelu, Xiaoli Li

Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

### 6. [Speech-Audio Compositional Attacks on Multimodal LLMs and Their Mitigation with SALMONN-Guard](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10222v1)

Authors: Yudong Yang, Xuezhen Zhang, Zhifeng Han, Siyin Wang, Jimin Zhuang, Zengrui Jin, Jing Shao, Guangzhi Sun, Chao Zhang

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled understanding of both speech and non-speech audio, but exposing new safety risks emerging from complex audio inputs that are inadequately handled by current safeguards. We introduce SACRED-Bench (Speech-Audio Composition for RED-teaming) to evaluate the robustness of LLMs under complex audio-based attacks. Unlike existing perturbation-based methods that rely on noise optimization or white-box access, SACRED-Bench exploits speech-audio composition mechanisms. SACRED-Bench adopts three mechanisms: (a) speech overlap and multi-speaker dialogue, which embeds harmful prompts beneath or alongside benign speech; (b) speech-audio mixture, which imply unsafe intent via non-speech audio alongside benign speech or audio; and (c) diverse spoken instruction formats (open-ended QA, yes/no) that evade text-only filters. Experiments show that, even Gemini 2.5 Pro, the state-of-the-art proprietary LLM, still exhibits 66% attack success rate in SACRED-Bench test set, exposing vulnerabilities under cross-modal, speech-audio composition attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose SALMONN-Guard, a safeguard LLM that jointly inspects speech, audio, and text for safety judgments, reducing attack success down to 20%. Our results highlight the need for audio-aware defenses for the safety of multimodal LLMs. The benchmark and SALMONN-Guard checkpoints can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/SACRED-Bench.

### 7. [Advanced Black-Box Tuning of Large Language Models with Limited API Calls](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10210v1)

Authors: Zhikang Xie, Weilin Wan, Peizhu Gong, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin

Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with "LogitMap Pairs" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.

### 8. [VISTA: A Vision and Intent-Aware Social Attention Framework for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10203v1)

Authors: Stephane Da Silva Martins, Emanuel Aldea, Sylvie Le Hégarat-Mascle

Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

### 9. [Two Constraint Compilation Methods for Lifted Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10164v1)

Authors: Periklis Mantenoglou, Luigi Bonassi, Enrico Scala, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires

We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.

### 10. [DenoGrad: Deep Gradient Denoising Framework for Enhancing the Performance of Interpretable AI Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10161v1)

Authors: J. Javier Alonso-Ramos, Ignacio Aguilera-Martos, Andrés Herrera-Poyatos, Francisco Herrera

The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [Lit Silicon: A Case Where Thermal Imbalance Couples Concurrent Execution in Multiple GPUs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09861v1)

Authors: Marco Kurzynski, Shaizeen Aga, Di Wu

GPU systems are increasingly powering modern datacenters at scale. Despite being highly performant, GPU systems suffer from performance variation at the node and cluster levels. Such performance variation significantly impacts both high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, such as cutting-edge large language models (LLMs). We analyze the performance of a single-node multi-GPU system running LLM training, and observe that the kernel-level performance variation is highly correlated with concurrent computation communication (C3), a technique to overlap computation and communication across GPUs for performance gains. We then take a further step to reason that thermally induced straggling coupling with C3 impacts performance variation, coined as the Lit Silicon effect. Lit Silicon describes that in a multi-GPU node, thermal imbalance across GPUs introduces node-level straggler GPUs, which in turn slow down the leader GPUs. Lit Silicon leads to node-level performance variation and inefficiency, impacting the entire datacenter from the bottom up. We propose analytical performance and power models for Lit Silicon, to understand the potential system-level gains. We further design simple detection and mitigation techniques to effectively address the Lit Silicon problem, and evaluate three different power management solutions, including power optimization under GPU thermal design power, performance optimization under node-level GPU power capping, and performance optimization under node-level CPU power sloshing. We conduct experiments on two workloads on two AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPU systems under two LLM training frameworks, and observe up to 6% performance and 4% power improvements, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars in datacenters. Our solution is almost free lunch and can be effortlessly adopted in datacenters as a new node-level power management layer.

### 2. [Beamspace Equalization for mmWave Massive MIMO: Algorithms and VLSI Implementations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10563v1)

Authors: Seyed Hadi Mirfarshbafan, Christoph Studer

Massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are key physical layer technologies in future wireless systems. Their deployment, however, is expected to incur excessive baseband processing hardware cost and power consumption. Beamspace processing leverages the channel sparsity at mmWave frequencies to reduce baseband processing complexity. In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. Furthermore, our fully-parallelized designs achieve the highest reported throughput among existing massive MIMO data detectors, while achieving better energy and area efficiency. We also present a sequential multiply-accumulate (MAC)-based architecture for CSPADE, which enables even higher power savings, i.e., up to 66%, compared to a MAC-based antenna-domain equalizer.

### 3. [The Role of Advanced Computer Architectures in Accelerating Artificial Intelligence Workloads](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10010v1)

Authors: Shahid Amin, Syed Pervez Hussnain Shah

The remarkable progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is foundation-ally linked to a concurrent revolution in computer architecture. As AI models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have grown in complexity, their massive computational demands have pushed traditional architectures to their limits. This paper provides a structured review of this co-evolution, analyzing the architectural landscape designed to accelerate modern AI workloads. We explore the dominant architectural paradigms Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Appli-cation-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field-Programmable Gate Ar-rays (FPGAs) by breaking down their design philosophies, key features, and per-formance trade-offs. The core principles essential for performance and energy efficiency, including dataflow optimization, advanced memory hierarchies, spar-sity, and quantization, are analyzed. Furthermore, this paper looks ahead to emerging technologies such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and neuromorphic computing, which may redefine future computation. By synthesizing architec-tural principles with quantitative performance data from industry-standard benchmarks, this survey presents a comprehensive picture of the AI accelerator landscape. We conclude that AI and computer architecture are in a symbiotic relationship, where hardware-software co-design is no longer an optimization but a necessity for future progress in computing.

### 4. [AssertMiner: Module-Level Spec Generation and Assertion Mining using Static Analysis Guided LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10007v1)

Authors: Hongqin Lyu, Yonghao Wang, Jiaxin Zhou, Zhiteng Chao, Tiancheng Wang, Huawei Li

Assertion-based verification (ABV) is a key approach to checking whether a logic design complies with its architectural specifications. Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules. When integrated with these methods, AssertMiner can enhance the structural coverage and significantly improve the error detection capability, enabling a more comprehensive and efficient verification process.

### 5. [Combined power management and congestion control in High-Speed Ethernet-based Networks for Supercomputers and Data Centers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10159v1)

Authors: Miguel Sánchez de la Rosa, Francisco J. andújar, Jesus Escudero-Sahuquillo, José L. Sánchez, Francisco J. Alfaro-Cortés

The demand for computer in our daily lives has led to the proliferation of Datacenters that power indispensable many services. On the other hand, computing has become essential for some research for various scientific fields, that require Supercomputers with vast computing capabilities to produce results in reasonable time. The scale and complexity of these systems, compared to our day-to-day devices, are like comparing a cell to a living organism. To make them work properly, we need state-of-the-art technology and engineering, not just raw resources. Interconnecting the different computer nodes that make up a whole is a delicate task, as it can become the bottleneck for the whole infrastructure. In this work, we explore two aspects of the network: how to prevent degradation under heavy use with congestion control, and how to save energy when idle with power management; and how the two may interact.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [Low-soundness direct-product testers and PCPs from Kaufman--Oppenheim complexes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10514v1)

Authors: Ryan O'Donnell, Noah G. Singer

We study the Kaufman--Oppenheim coset complexes (STOC 2018, Eur. J. Comb. 2023), which have an elementary and strongly explicit description. Answering an open question of Kaufman, Oppenheim, and Weinberger (STOC 2025), we show that they support sparse direct-product testers in the low soundness regime. Our proof relies on the HDX characterization of agreement testing by Bafna--Minzer and Dikstein--Dinur (both STOC 2024), the recent result of Kaufman. et al, and follows techniques from Bafna--Lifshitz--Minzer and Dikstein--Dinur--Lubotzky (both FOCS 2024). Ultimately, the task reduces to showing dimension-independent coboundary expansion of certain $2$-dimensional subcomplexes of the KO complex; following the ``Dehn method'' of Kaufman and Oppenheim (ICALP 2021), we do this by establishing efficient presentation bounds for certain matrix groups over polynomial rings.
  As shown by Bafna, Minzer, and Vyas (STOC 2025), a consequence of our direct-product testing result is that the Kaufman--Oppenheim complexes can also be used to obtain PCPs with arbitrarily small constant soundness and quasilinear length. Thus the use of sophisticated number theory and algebraic group-theoretic tools in the construction of these PCPs can be avoided.

### Computational Engineering

### 1. [Boosting In-Silicon Directed Evolution with Fine-Tuned Protein Language Model and Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09900v1)

Authors: Yaodong Yang, Yang Wang, Jinpeng Li, Pei Guo, Da Han, Guangyong Chen, Pheng-Ann Heng

Protein evolution through amino acid sequence mutations is a cornerstone of life sciences. While current in-silicon directed evolution algorithms focus on designing search strategies, they overlook how to utilize the transformative protein language models, which encode rich evolutionary patterns, to guide search. To bridge this gap, we propose AlphaDE, a novel framework to evolve protein sequences by harnessing the innovative paradigms of large language models. First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.

### 2. [Provably Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Solving Nonlinear Differential Equations Using Multiple Bosonic Modes Coupled with Qubits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09939v1)

Authors: Yu Gan, Hirad Alipanah, Jinglei Cheng, Zeguan Wu, Guangyi Li, Juan José Mendoza-Arenas, Peyman Givi, Mujeeb R. Malik, Brian J. McDermott, Junyu Liu

Quantum computers have long been expected to efficiently solve complex classical differential equations. Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\mathcal{O}\left(T(\log L + d r \log K)\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware.

### 3. [Localized kernel gradient correction for SPH simulations of water wave propagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10064v1)

Authors: Lennart Justin Schulze, Vito Zago, Giuseppe Bilotta, Robert Anthony Dalrymple

Basic Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) models exhibit excessive, numerical dissipation in the simulation of water wave propagation. This can be remedied using higher-order approaches such as kernel gradient correction, which introduce additional computational effort. The present work demonstrates, that the higher-order scheme is only required in a limited part of the water wave in order to obtain satisfying results. The criterion for distinguishing particles in need of special treatment from those that do not is motivated by water wave mechanics. Especially for deep water waves, the approach potentially spares large amounts of computational effort. The present paper also proposes a remedy for issues of the kernel gradient correction occurring at the free surface. Satisfying results for the proposed approach are shown for a standing wave in a basin and a progressive wave train in a long wave tank.

### 4. [Phase field modelling of cracking and capacity fade in core-shell cathode particles for lithium-ion batteries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10355v1)

Authors: Y. Tu, B. Wu, E. Martínez-Pañeda

Core-shell electrode particles are a promising morphology control strategy for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. However, experimental observations reveal that these structures remain prone to mechanical failure, with shell fractures and core-shell debonding occurring after a single charge. In this work, we present a novel, comprehensive computational framework to predict and gain insight into the failure of core-shell morphologies and the associated degradation in battery performance. The fully coupled chemo-mechano-damage model presented captures the interplay between mechanical damage and electrochemical behaviours, enabling the quantification of particle cracking and capacity fade. Both bulk material fracture and interface debonding are captured by utilising the phase field method. We quantify the severity of particle cracking and capacity loss through case studies on a representative core-shell system (NMC811@NMC532). The results bring valuable insights into cracking patterns, underlying mechanisms, and their impact on capacity loss. Surface cracks are found to initiate when a significantly higher lithium concentration accumulates in the core compared to the shell. Interfacial debonding is shown to arise from localised hoop stresses near the core-shell interface, due to greater shell expansion. This debonding develops rapidly, impedes lithium-ion transport, and can lead to more than 10\% capacity loss after a single discharge. Furthermore, larger particles may experience crack branching driven by extensive tensile zones, potentially fragmenting the entire particle. The framework developed can not only bring new insight into the degradation mechanisms of core-shell particles but also be used to design electrode materials with improved performance and extended lifetime.

### 1. [Witness Set in Monotone Polygons: Exact and Approximate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10224v1)

Authors: Udvas Das, Binayak Dutta, Satyabrata Jana, Debabrata Pal, Sasanka Roy

Given a simple polygon $\mathscr{P}$, two points $x$ and $y$ within $\mathscr{P}$ are {\em visible} to each other if the line segment between $x$ and $y$ is contained in $\mathscr{P}$. The {\em visibility region} of a point $x$ includes all points in $\mathscr{P}$ that are visible from $x$. A point set $Q$ within a polygon $\mathscr{P}$ is said to be a \emph{witness set} for $\mathscr{P}$ if each point in $\mathscr{P}$ is visible from at most one point from $Q$. The problem of finding the largest size witness set in a given polygon was introduced by Amit et al. [Int. J. Comput. Geom. Appl. 2010]. Recently, Daescu et al. [Comput. Geom. 2019] gave a linear-time algorithm for this problem on monotone mountains. In this study, we contribute to this field by obtaining the largest witness set within both continuous and discrete models.
  In the {\sc Witness Set (WS)} problem, the input is a polygon $\mathscr{P}$, and the goal is to find a maximum-sized witness set in $\mathscr{P}$. In the {\sc Discrete Witness Set (DisWS)} problem, one is given a finite set of points $S$ alongside $\mathscr{P}$, and the task is to find a witness set $Q \subseteq S$ that maximizes $|Q|$. We investigate {\sc DisWS} in simple polygons, but consider {\sc WS} specifically for monotone polygons. Our main contribution is as follows: (1) a polynomial time algorithm for {\sc DisWS} for general polygons and (2) the discretization of the {\sc WS} problem for monotone polygons. Specifically, given a monotone polygon with $r$ reflex vertices, and a positive integer $k$ we generate a point set $Q$ with size $r^{O(k)} \cdot n$ such that $Q$ contains an witness set of size $k$ (if exists). This leads to an exact algorithm for {\sc WS} problem in monotone polygons running in time $r^{O(k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$. We also provide a PTAS for this with running time $r^{O(1/ε)} n^2$.

### Computation and Language

### 1. [Computing the Formal and Institutional Boundaries of Contemporary Genre and Literary Fiction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10546v1)

Authors: Natasha Johnson

Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

### 2. [Convomem Benchmark: Why Your First 150 Conversations Don't Need RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10523v1)

Authors: Egor Pakhomov, Erik Nijkamp, Caiming Xiong

We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

### 3. [Say It Differently: Linguistic Styles as Jailbreak Vectors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10519v1)

Authors: Srikant Panda, Avinash Rai

Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

Authors: Junquan Huang, Haotian Wu, Yubo Gao, Yibo Yan, Junyan Zhang, Yonghua Hei, Song Dai, Jie Zhang, Puay Siew Tan, Xuming Hu

Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

### 5. [On the Military Applications of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10093v1)

Authors: Satu Johansson, Taneli Riihonen

In this paper, military use cases or applications and implementation thereof are considered for natural language processing and large language models, which have broken into fame with the invention of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) and the extensive foundation model pretraining done by OpenAI for ChatGPT and others. First, we interrogate a GPT-based language model (viz. Microsoft Copilot) to make it reveal its own knowledge about their potential military applications and then critically assess the information. Second, we study how commercial cloud services (viz. Microsoft Azure) could be used readily to build such applications and assess which of them are feasible. We conclude that the summarization and generative properties of language models directly facilitate many applications at large and other features may find particular uses.

Authors: Shivam Sharma, Riya Naik, Tejas Gawas, Heramb Patil, Kunal Korgaonkar

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

### 7. [Leveraging Large Language Models for Identifying Knowledge Components](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09935v1)

Authors: Canwen Wang, Jionghao Lin, Kenneth R. Koedinger

Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

### 8. [MINDS: A Cross-cultural Dialogue Corpus for Social Norm Classification and Adherence Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09918v1)

Authors: Pritish Sahu, Anirudh Som, Dimitra Vergyri, Ajay Divakaran

Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

### 9. [EnchTable: Unified Safety Alignment Transfer in Fine-tuned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09880v1)

Authors: Jialin Wu, Kecen Li, Zhicong Huang, Xinfeng Li, Xiaofeng Wang, Cheng Hong

Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving. However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.

### 10. [In-Token Rationality Optimization: Towards Accurate and Concise LLM Reasoning via Self-Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09865v1)

Authors: Mingye Zhu, Yi Liu, Zheren Fu, Quan Wang, Yongdong Zhang

Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for chain-of-thought reasoning presents a significant challenge: supervised fine-tuning on a single "golden" rationale hurts generalization as it penalizes equally valid alternatives, whereas reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards struggles with credit assignment and prohibitive computational cost. To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.

### Cryptography and Security

### 1. [How Worrying Are Privacy Attacks Against Machine Learning?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10516v1)

Authors: Josep Domingo-Ferrer

In several jurisdictions, the regulatory framework on the release and sharing of personal data is being extended to machine learning (ML). The implicit assumption is that disclosing a trained ML model entails a privacy risk for any personal data used in training comparable to directly releasing those data. However, given a trained model, it is necessary to mount a privacy attack to make inferences on the training data. In this concept paper, we examine the main families of privacy attacks against predictive and generative ML, including membership inference attacks (MIAs), property inference attacks, and reconstruction attacks. Our discussion shows that most of these attacks seem less effective in the real world than what a prima face interpretation of the related literature could suggest.

Authors: Jiayang Meng, Tao Huang, Hong Chen, Chen Hou, Guolong Zheng

Federated learning synchronizes models through gradient transmission and aggregation. However, these gradients pose significant privacy risks, as sensitive training data is embedded within them. Existing gradient inversion attacks suffer from significantly degraded reconstruction performance when gradients are perturbed by noise-a common defense mechanism. In this paper, we introduce Gradient-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models (GG-CDMs) for reconstructing private images from leaked gradients without prior knowledge of the target data distribution. Our approach leverages the inherent denoising capability of diffusion models to circumvent the partial protection offered by noise perturbation, thereby improving attack performance under such defenses. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the reconstruction error bounds and the convergence properties of attack loss, characterizing the impact of key factors-such as noise magnitude and attacked model architecture-on reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate our attack's superior reconstruction performance with Gaussian noise-perturbed gradients, and confirm our theoretical findings.

### 4. [zkStruDul: Programming zkSNARKs with Structural Duality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10565v1)

Authors: Rahul Krishnan, Ashley Samuelson, Emily Yao, Ethan Cecchetti

Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge (NIZK) proofs, such as zkSNARKS, let one prove knowledge of private data without revealing it or interacting with a verifier. While existing tooling focuses on specifying the predicate to be proven, real-world applications optimize predicate definitions to minimize proof generation overhead, but must correspondingly transform predicate inputs. Implementing these two steps separately duplicates logic that must precisely match to avoid catastrophic security flaws. We address this shortcoming with zkStruDul, a language that unifies input transformations and predicate definitions into a single combined abstraction from which a compiler can project both procedures, eliminating duplicate code and problematic mismatches. zkStruDul provides a high-level abstraction to layer on top of existing NIZK technology and supports important features like recursive proofs. We provide a source-level semantics and prove its behavior is identical to the projected semantics, allowing straightforward standard reasoning.

### 5. [An In-Depth Systematic Analysis of the Security, Usability, and Automation Capabilities of Password Update Processes on Top-Ranked Websites](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10111v1)

Authors: Alexander Krause, Jacques Suray, Lea Schmüser, Marten Oltrogge, Oliver Wiese, Maximilian Golla, Sascha Fahl

Password updates are a critical account security measure and an essential part of the password lifecycle. Service providers and common security recommendations advise users to update their passwords in response to incidents or as a critical cyber hygiene measure. However, password update processes are often cumbersome and require manual password creation. Inconsistent and complex workflows and a lack of automation capabilities for password managers further negatively impact overall password security.
  In this work, we perform the first in-depth systematic analysis of 111 password update processes deployed on top-ranked websites. We provide novel insights into their overall security, usability, and automation capabilities and contribute to authentication security research through a better understanding of password update processes. Websites deploy highly diverse, often complex, confusing password update processes and lack the support of password managers. Processes are often hard to use, and end-users can barely transfer experiences and knowledge across websites. Notably, protective measures designed to enhance security frequently obstruct password manager automation. We conclude our work by discussing our findings and giving recommendations for web developers, the web standardization community, and security researchers.

Authors: Go Tsuruoka, Takami Sato, Qi Alfred Chen, Kazuki Nomoto, Ryunosuke Kobayashi, Yuna Tanaka, Tatsuya Mori

Traffic sign recognition plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient transportation of autonomous vehicles but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks using stickers or laser projections. While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.

### 7. [On the Detectability of Active Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10502v1)

Authors: Vincenzo Carletti, Pasquale Foggia, Carlo Mazzocca, Giuseppe Parrella, Mario Vento

One of the key advantages of Federated Learning (FL) is its ability to collaboratively train a Machine Learning (ML) model while keeping clients' data on-site. However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.

Authors: Duc-Ly Vu, Thanh-Cong Nguyen, Minh-Khanh Vu, Ngoc-Thanh Nguyen, Kim-Anh Do Thi

The increasingly sophisticated environment in which attackers operate makes software security an even greater challenge in open-source projects, where malicious packages are prevalent. Static analysis tools, such as Malcontent, are highly useful but are often incapable of dealing with obfuscated malware. Such situations lead to an unreasonably high rate of false positives. This paper highlights that dynamic analysis, rather than static analysis, provides greater insight but is also more resource-intensive for understanding software behaviour during execution. In this study, we enhance a dynamic analysis tool, package-analysis, to capture key runtime behaviours, including commands executed, files accessed, and network communications. This modification enables the use of container sandboxing technologies, such as gVisor, to analyse potentially malicious packages without significantly compromising the host system.

Authors: Shuo Shi, Jinghuai Zhang, Shijie Jiang, Chunyi Zhou, Yuyuan Li, Mengying Zhu, Yangyang Wu, Tianyu Du

Dataset distillation (DD) compresses large datasets into smaller ones while preserving the performance of models trained on them. Although DD is often assumed to enhance data privacy by aggregating over individual examples, recent studies reveal that standard DD can still leak sensitive information from the original dataset due to the lack of formal privacy guarantees. Existing differentially private (DP)-DD methods attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting noise into the distillation process. However, they often fail to fully leverage the original dataset, resulting in degraded realism and utility. This paper introduces \libn, a novel framework that addresses the key limitations of current DP-DD by leveraging DP-generated data. Specifically, \lib initializes the distilled dataset with DP-generated data to enhance realism. Then, generated data refines the DP-feature matching technique to distill the original dataset under a small privacy budget, and trains an expert model to align the distilled examples with their class distribution. Furthermore, we design a privacy budget allocation strategy to determine budget consumption across DP components and provide a theoretical analysis of the overall privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments show that \lib significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DP-DD methods in terms of both dataset utility and robustness against membership inference attacks, establishing a new paradigm for privacy-preserving dataset distillation.

Authors: Lingzhi Wang, Vinod Yegneswaran, Xinyi Shi, Ziyu Li, Ashish Gehani, Yan Chen

Provenance-based intrusion detection is an increasingly popular application of graphical machine learning in cybersecurity, where system activities are modeled as provenance graphs to capture causality and correlations among potentially malicious actions. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in this setting. However, traditional statically-provisioned GNN inference architectures fall short in meeting two crucial demands of intrusion detection: (1) maintaining consistently low detection latency, and (2) handling highly irregular and bursty workloads. To holistically address these challenges, we present GraphFaaS, a serverless architecture tailored for GNN-based intrusion detection. GraphFaaS leverages the elasticity and agility of serverless computing to dynamically scale the GNN inference pipeline. We parallelize and adapt GNN workflows to a serverless environment, ensuring that the system can respond in real time to fluctuating workloads. By decoupling compute resources from static provisioning, GraphFaaS delivers stable inference latency, which is critical for dependable intrusion detection and timely incident response in cybersecurity operations. Preliminary evaluation shows GraphFaaS reduces average detection latency by 85% and coefficient of variation (CV) by 64% compared to the baseline.

Authors: Daniela Martin, Jinsu Hong, Connor O'Brien, Valmir P Moraes Filho, Jasmine R. Kobayashi, Evangelia Samara, Joseph Gallego

Space weather at Earth, driven by the solar activity, poses growing risks to satellites around our planet as well as to critical ground-based technological infrastructure. Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Authors: Isabela Albuquerque, Ira Ktena, Olivia Wiles, Ivana Kajić, Amal Rannen-Triki, Cristina Vasconcelos, Aida Nematzadeh

Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

Authors: Wei Li, Renshan Zhang, Rui Shao, Zhijian Fang, Kaiwen Zhou, Zhuotao Tian, Liqiang Nie

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

Authors: Yusuf Talha Basak, Mehmet Ozan Unal, Metin Ertas, Isa Yildirim

Although Total Variation (TV) performs well in noise reduction and edge preservation on images, its dependence on the lambda parameter limits its efficiency and makes it difficult to use effectively. In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework that couples an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) predicting a per-pixel regularization map. The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using a realistic noise model adapted from the LoDoPaB-CT methodology, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average. LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and a basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/itu-biai/deep_tv_for_ldct

Authors: Yaru Li, Yanxue Wang, Meng Li, Xinming Li, Jianbo Feng

The health condition of wind turbine (WT) components is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable operation. However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

### 6. [MSGNav: Unleashing the Power of Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph for Zero-Shot Embodied Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10376v1)

Authors: Xun Huang, Shijia Zhao, Yunxiang Wang, Xin Lu, Wanfa Zhang, Rongsheng Qu, Weixin Li, Yunhong Wang, Chenglu Wen

Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

Authors: Thales Bezerra, Emanoel Thyago, Kelvin Cunha, Rodrigo Abreu, Fábio Papais, Francisco Mauro, Natália Lopes, Érico Medeiros, Jéssica Guido, Shirley Cruz, Paulo Borba, Tsang Ing Ren

AI-based dermatology adoption remains limited by biased datasets, variable image quality, and limited validation. We introduce DermAI, a lightweight, smartphone-based application that enables real-time capture, annotation, and classification of skin lesions during routine consultations. Unlike prior dermoscopy-focused tools, DermAI performs on-device quality checks, and local model adaptation. The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance. These results highlight the importance of standardized, diverse data collection aligned with healthcare needs and oriented to machine learning development.

### 8. [Generalizable Slum Detection from Satellite Imagery with Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10300v1)

Authors: Sumin Lee, Sungwon Park, Jeasurk Yang, Jihee Kim, Meeyoung Cha

Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

Authors: Yanbei Jiang, Chao Lei, Yihao Ding, Krista Ehinger, Jey Han Lau

Despite significant progress, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with complex visual reasoning, where multi-step dependencies cause early errors to cascade through the reasoning chain. Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

Authors: Yueran Zhao, Zhang Zhang, Chao Sun, Tianze Wang, Chao Yue, Nuoran Li

Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception extends sensing beyond single vehicle limits through transmission. However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior perception performance with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our implementation will be released soon.

### 1. [Generalizable Slum Detection from Satellite Imagery with Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10300v1)

Authors: Sumin Lee, Sungwon Park, Jeasurk Yang, Jihee Kim, Meeyoung Cha

Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

### 2. [Reinforcing Trustworthiness in Multimodal Emotional Support Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10011v1)

Authors: Huy M. Le, Dat Tien Nguyen, Ngan T. T. Vo, Tuan D. Q. Nguyen, Nguyen Binh Le, Duy Minh Ho Nguyen, Daniel Sonntag, Lizi Liao, Binh T. Nguyen

In today's world, emotional support is increasingly essential, yet it remains challenging for both those seeking help and those offering it. Multimodal approaches to emotional support show great promise by integrating diverse data sources to provide empathetic, contextually relevant responses, fostering more effective interactions. However, current methods have notable limitations, often relying solely on text or converting other data types into text, or providing emotion recognition only, thus overlooking the full potential of multimodal inputs. Moreover, many studies prioritize response generation without accurately identifying critical emotional support elements or ensuring the reliability of outputs. To overcome these issues, we introduce \textsc{ MultiMood}, a new framework that (i) leverages multimodal embeddings from video, audio, and text to predict emotional components and to produce responses responses aligned with professional therapeutic standards. To improve trustworthiness, we (ii) incorporate novel psychological criteria and apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize large language models (LLMs) for consistent adherence to these standards. We also (iii) analyze several advanced LLMs to assess their multimodal emotional support capabilities. Experimental results show that MultiMood achieves state-of-the-art on MESC and DFEW datasets while RL-driven trustworthiness improvements are validated through human and LLM evaluations, demonstrating its superior capability in applying a multimodal framework in this domain.

### 3. [Mailing address aliasing as a method to protect consumer privacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10001v1)

Authors: Greg Hather, Daniel Aranki

During online commerce, a customer will typically share his or her mailing address with a merchant to allow product delivery. This creates privacy risks for the customer, where the information may be misused, sold, or leaked by multiple merchants. While physical and virtual PO boxes can reduce the privacy risk, these solutions have associated costs that prevent greater adoption. Here, we introduce the concept of mailing address aliasing, which may offer lower cost and greater control in some cases. With this approach, an alias address is created that maps to the customer's true address. The mapping is kept private from the merchant but shared with the carrier. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared with traditional methods for mailing address privacy. We find that mailing address aliasing is likely to reduce unsolicited mail to a greater extent than physical or virtual PO boxes. However, mailing address aliasing may not be compatible with all merchants' ordering systems.

### 4. [Answering Students' Questions on Course Forums Using Multiple Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Finetuning RAG-Enabled LLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09831v1)

Authors: Neo Wang, Sonit Singh

The course forums are increasingly significant and play vital role in facilitating student discussions and answering their questions related to the course. It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.

### 5. [Preview, Accept or Discard? A Predictive Low-Motion Interaction Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10532v1)

Authors: Jose Berengueres

Repetitive strain injury (RSI) affects roughly one in five computer users and remains largely unresolved despite decades of ergonomic mouse redesign. All such devices share a fundamental limitation: they still require fine-motor motion to operate. This work investigates whether predictive, AI-assisted input can reduce that motion by replacing physical pointing with ranked on-screen suggestions. To preserve user agency, we introduce Preview Accept Discard (PAD), a zero-click interaction paradigm that lets users preview predicted GUI targets, cycle through a small set of ranked alternatives, and accept or discard them via key-release timing. We evaluate PAD in two settings: a browser-based email client and a ISO 9241-9 keyboard-prediction task under varying top-3 accuracies. Across both studies, PAD substantially reduces hand motion relative to trackpad use while maintaining comparable task times with the trackpad only when accuracies are similar to those of the best spell-checkers.

### 6. [Navigating the Ethics of Internet Measurement: Researchers' Perspectives from a Case Study in the EU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10408v1)

Authors: Sahibzada Farhan Amin, Sana Athar, Anja Feldmann, Ha Dao, Mannat Kaur

Internet measurement research is essential for understanding, improving, and securing Internet infrastructure. However, its methods often involve large-scale data collection and user observation, raising complex ethical questions. While recent research has identified ethical challenges in Internet measurement research and laid out best practices, little is known about how researchers actually make ethical decisions in their research practice. To understand how these practices take shape day-to-day from the perspective of Internet measurement researchers, we interviewed 16 researchers from an Internet measurement research group in the EU. Through thematic analysis, we find that researchers deal with five main ethical challenges: privacy and consent issues, the possibility of unintended harm, balancing transparency with security and accountability, uncertain ethical boundaries, and hurdles in the ethics review process. Researchers address these by lab testing, rate limiting, setting up clear communication channels, and relying heavily on mentors and colleagues for guidance. Researchers express that ethical requirements vary across institutions, jurisdictions and conferences, and ethics review boards often lack the technical knowledge to evaluate Internet measurement research. We also highlight the invisible labor of Internet measurement researchers and describe their ethics practices as craft knowledge, both of which are crucial in upholding responsible research practices in the Internet measurement community.

### 7. [Simulating Misinformation Propagation in Social Networks using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10384v1)

Authors: Raj Gaurav Maurya, Vaibhav Shukla, Raj Abhijit Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat

Misinformation on social media thrives on surprise, emotion, and identity-driven reasoning, often amplified through human cognitive biases. To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.

Authors: Juliana Nieto-Cardenas, Erin Joy Kramer, Peter Kurto, Ethan Dickey, Andres Bejarano

We present Owlgorithm, an educational platform that supports Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in competitive programming (CP) through AI-generated reflective questions. Leveraging GPT-4o, Owlgorithm produces context-aware, metacognitive prompts tailored to individual student submissions. Integrated into a second- and third-year CP course, the system-provided reflective prompts adapted to student outcomes: guiding deeper conceptual insight for correct solutions and structured debugging for partial or failed ones.
  Our exploratory assessment of student ratings and TA feedback revealed both promising benefits and notable limitations. While many found the generated questions useful for reflection and debugging, concerns were raised about feedback accuracy and classroom usability. These results suggest advantages of LLM-supported reflection for novice programmers, though refinements are needed to ensure reliability and pedagogical value for advanced learners.
  From our experience, several key insights emerged: GenAI can effectively support structured reflection, but careful prompt design, dynamic adaptation, and usability improvements are critical to realizing their potential in education. We offer specific recommendations for educators using similar tools and outline next steps to enhance Owlgorithm's educational impact. The underlying framework may also generalize to other reflective learning contexts.

### 10. [LocalBench: Benchmarking LLMs on County-Level Local Knowledge and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10459v1)

Authors: Zihan Gao, Yifei Xu, Jacob Thebault-Spieker

Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

### 1. [DemoTuner: Efficient DBMS Knobs Tuning via LLM-Assisted Demonstration Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09998v1)

Authors: Hui Dou, Lei Jin, Yuxuan Zhou, Jiang He, Yiwen Zhang

The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.

Authors: Yaqiao Zhu, Hongkai Wen, Mark Birkin, Man Luo

Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for urban computing, from spatial reasoning to predictive analytics. However, evaluating LLMs across diverse urban tasks faces two critical challenges: lack of unified platforms for consistent multi-source data access and fragmented task definitions that hinder fair comparison. To address these challenges, we present CityVerse, the first unified platform integrating multi-source urban data, capability-based task taxonomy, and dynamic simulation for systematic LLM evaluation in urban contexts. CityVerse provides: 1) coordinate-based Data APIs unifying ten categories of urban data-including spatial features, temporal dynamics, demographics, and multi-modal imagery-with over 38 million curated records; 2) Task APIs organizing 43 urban computing tasks into a four-level cognitive hierarchy: Perception, Spatial Understanding, Reasoning and Prediction, and Decision and Interaction, enabling standardized evaluation across capability levels; 3) an interactive visualization frontend supporting real-time data retrieval, multi-layer display, and simulation replay for intuitive exploration and validation. We validate the platform's effectiveness through evaluations on mainstream LLMs across representative tasks, demonstrating its capability to support reproducible and systematic assessment. CityVerse provides a reusable foundation for advancing LLMs and multi-task approaches in the urban computing domain.

Authors: Qifeng Cai, Hao Liang, Chang Xu, Tao Xie, Wentao Zhang, Bin Cui

The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

Authors: Yiwen Wang, Vivek Shah, Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles, Claudia Bauzer Medeiros, Julio Cesar Dos Reis, Yongluan Zhou

Novel reactive moving object applications require solutions to support object reactive behaviors as a way to query and update dynamic data. While moving object scenarios have long been researched in the context of spatio-temporal data management, reactive behavior is usually left to complex end-user implementations. However, it is not just a matter of hardwiring reactive constraints: the required solutions need to satisfy tight low-latency computation requirements and be scalable. This paper explores a novel approach to enrich a distributed actor-based framework with reactive functionality and complex spatial data management along with concurrency semantics. Our approach relies on a proposal of the moving actor abstraction, which is a conceptual enhancement of the actor model with reactive sensing, movement, and spatial querying capabilities. This enhancement helps developers of reactive moving object applications avoid the significant burden of implementing application-level schemes to balance performance and consistency. Based on moving actors, we define a reactive moving object data management platform, named Moving Actor-Oriented Databases (M-AODBs), and build Dolphin -- an implementation of M-AODBs. Dolphin embodies a non-intrusive actor-based design layered on top of the Microsoft Orleans distributed virtual actor framework. In a set of experimental evaluations with realistic reactive moving object scenarios, Dolphin exhibits scalability on multi-machines and provides near-real-time reaction latency.

Authors: Marco Kurzynski, Shaizeen Aga, Di Wu

GPU systems are increasingly powering modern datacenters at scale. Despite being highly performant, GPU systems suffer from performance variation at the node and cluster levels. Such performance variation significantly impacts both high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, such as cutting-edge large language models (LLMs). We analyze the performance of a single-node multi-GPU system running LLM training, and observe that the kernel-level performance variation is highly correlated with concurrent computation communication (C3), a technique to overlap computation and communication across GPUs for performance gains. We then take a further step to reason that thermally induced straggling coupling with C3 impacts performance variation, coined as the Lit Silicon effect. Lit Silicon describes that in a multi-GPU node, thermal imbalance across GPUs introduces node-level straggler GPUs, which in turn slow down the leader GPUs. Lit Silicon leads to node-level performance variation and inefficiency, impacting the entire datacenter from the bottom up. We propose analytical performance and power models for Lit Silicon, to understand the potential system-level gains. We further design simple detection and mitigation techniques to effectively address the Lit Silicon problem, and evaluate three different power management solutions, including power optimization under GPU thermal design power, performance optimization under node-level GPU power capping, and performance optimization under node-level CPU power sloshing. We conduct experiments on two workloads on two AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPU systems under two LLM training frameworks, and observe up to 6% performance and 4% power improvements, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars in datacenters. Our solution is almost free lunch and can be effortlessly adopted in datacenters as a new node-level power management layer.

Authors: Changhai Man, Joongun Park, Hanjiang Wu, Huan Xu, Srinivas Sridharan, Tushar Krishna

Optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on large-scale AI training and inference systems requires a scalable and expressive mechanism to model distributed workload execution. Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication. STAGE will be publicly available to facilitate further research in distributed machine learning systems.

Authors: Tao Tang, Youfu Jiang, Yingbo Cui, Jianbin Fang, Peng Zhang, Lin Peng, Chun Huang

Sparse matrix ordering is a vital optimization technique often employed for solving large-scale sparse matrices. Its goal is to minimize the matrix bandwidth by reorganizing its rows and columns, thus enhancing efficiency. Conventional methods for algorithm selection usually depend on brute-force search or empirical knowledge, lacking the ability to adjust to diverse sparse matrix structures.As a result, we have introduced a supervised learning-based model for choosing sparse matrix reordering algorithms. This model grasps the correlation between matrix characteristics and commonly utilized reordering algorithms, facilitating the automated and intelligent selection of the suitable sparse matrix reordering algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Florida sparse matrix dataset reveal that our model can accurately predict the optimal reordering algorithm for various matrices, leading to a 55.37% reduction in solution time compared to solely using the AMD reordering algorithm, with an average speedup ratio of 1.45.

Authors: Zhangcheng Feng, Defeng Sun, Yancheng Yuan, Guojun Zhang

This paper introduces the distributed Halpern Peaceman--Rachford (dHPR) method, an efficient algorithm for solving distributed convex composite optimization problems with non-smooth objectives, which achieves a non-ergodic $O(1/k)$ iteration complexity regarding Karush--Kuhn--Tucker residual. By leveraging the symmetric Gauss--Seidel decomposition, the dHPR effectively decouples the linear operators in the objective functions and consensus constraints while maintaining parallelizability and avoiding additional large proximal terms, leading to a decentralized implementation with provably fast convergence. The superior performance of dHPR is demonstrated through comprehensive numerical experiments on distributed LASSO, group LASSO, and $L_1$-regularized logistic regression problems.

### 5. [SMoFi: Step-wise Momentum Fusion for Split Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09828v1)

Authors: Mingkun Yang, Ran Zhu, Qing Wang, Jie Yang

Split Federated Learning is a system-efficient federated learning paradigm that leverages the rich computing resources at a central server to train model partitions. Data heterogeneity across silos, however, presents a major challenge undermining the convergence speed and accuracy of the global model. This paper introduces Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi), an effective and lightweight framework that counteracts gradient divergence arising from data heterogeneity by synchronizing the momentum buffers across server-side optimizers. To control gradient divergence over the training process, we design a staleness-aware alignment mechanism that imposes constraints on gradient updates of the server-side submodel at each optimization step. Extensive validations on multiple real-world datasets show that SMoFi consistently improves global model accuracy (up to 7.1%) and convergence speed (up to 10.25$\times$). Furthermore, SMoFi has a greater impact with more clients involved and deeper learning models, making it particularly suitable for model training in resource-constrained contexts.

### 6. [Unlocking Dynamic Inter-Client Spatial Dependencies: A Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Method for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10434v1)

Authors: Feng Wang, Tianxiang Chen, Shuyue Wei, Qian Chu, Yi Zhang, Yifan Sun, Zhiming Zheng

Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

We provide descriptions of three classes of schedulers: Operating Systems Process Schedulers, Cluster Systems Jobs Schedulers and Big Data Schedulers. We describe their evolution from early adoptions to modern implementations, considering both the use and features of algorithms. In summary, we discuss differences between all presented classes of schedulers and discuss their chronological development. In conclusion we highlight similarities in the focus of scheduling strategies design, applicable to both local and distributed systems.

Authors: Aarush Agarwal, Raymond He, Jan Kieseler, Matteo Cremonesi, Shah Rukh Qasim

We introduce FastGraph, a novel GPU-optimized k-nearest neighbor algorithm specifically designed to accelerate graph construction in low-dimensional spaces (2-10 dimensions), critical for high-performance graph neural networks. Our method employs a GPU-resident, bin-partitioned approach with full gradient-flow support and adaptive parameter tuning, significantly enhancing both computational and memory efficiency. Benchmarking demonstrates that FastGraph achieves a 20-40x speedup over state-of-the-art libraries such as FAISS, ANNOY, and SCANN in dimensions less than 10 with virtually no memory overhead. These improvements directly translate into substantial performance gains for GNN-based workflows, particularly benefiting computationally intensive applications in low dimensions such as particle clustering in high-energy physics, visual object tracking, and graph clustering.

This paper presents an experimental evaluation of parallel-in-time Kalman filters and smoothers using graphics processing units (GPUs). In particular, the paper evaluates different all-prefix-sum algorithms, that is, parallel scan algorithms for temporal parallelization of Kalman filters and smoothers in two ways: by calculating the required number of operations via simulation, and by measuring the actual run time of the algorithms on real GPU hardware. In addition, a novel parallel-in-time two-filter smoother is proposed and experimentally evaluated. Julia code for Metal and CUDA implementations of all the algorithms is made publicly available.

Authors: Rinieri Lorenzo, Gori Giacomo, Melis Andrea, Girau Roberto, Prandini Marco, Callegati Franco

The OPC UA protocol is becoming the de facto standard for Industry 4.0 machine-to-machine communication. It stands out as one of the few industrial protocols that provide robust security features designed to prevent attackers from manipulating and damaging critical infrastructures. However, prior works showed that significant challenges still exists to set up secure OPC UA deployments in practice, mainly caused by the complexity of certificate management in industrial scenarios and the inconsistent implementation of security features across industrial OPC UA devices. In this paper, we present Pk-IOTA, an automated solution designed to secure OPC UA communications by integrating programmable data plane switches for in-network certificate validation and leveraging the IOTA Tangle for decen- tralized certificate distribution. Our evaluation is performed on a physical testbed representing a real-world industrial scenario and shows that Pk-IOTA introduces a minimal overhead while providing a scalable and tamper-proof mechanism for OPC UA certificate management.

Authors: Udvas Das, Binayak Dutta, Satyabrata Jana, Debabrata Pal, Sasanka Roy

Given a simple polygon $\mathscr{P}$, two points $x$ and $y$ within $\mathscr{P}$ are {\em visible} to each other if the line segment between $x$ and $y$ is contained in $\mathscr{P}$. The {\em visibility region} of a point $x$ includes all points in $\mathscr{P}$ that are visible from $x$. A point set $Q$ within a polygon $\mathscr{P}$ is said to be a \emph{witness set} for $\mathscr{P}$ if each point in $\mathscr{P}$ is visible from at most one point from $Q$. The problem of finding the largest size witness set in a given polygon was introduced by Amit et al. [Int. J. Comput. Geom. Appl. 2010]. Recently, Daescu et al. [Comput. Geom. 2019] gave a linear-time algorithm for this problem on monotone mountains. In this study, we contribute to this field by obtaining the largest witness set within both continuous and discrete models.
  In the {\sc Witness Set (WS)} problem, the input is a polygon $\mathscr{P}$, and the goal is to find a maximum-sized witness set in $\mathscr{P}$. In the {\sc Discrete Witness Set (DisWS)} problem, one is given a finite set of points $S$ alongside $\mathscr{P}$, and the task is to find a witness set $Q \subseteq S$ that maximizes $|Q|$. We investigate {\sc DisWS} in simple polygons, but consider {\sc WS} specifically for monotone polygons. Our main contribution is as follows: (1) a polynomial time algorithm for {\sc DisWS} for general polygons and (2) the discretization of the {\sc WS} problem for monotone polygons. Specifically, given a monotone polygon with $r$ reflex vertices, and a positive integer $k$ we generate a point set $Q$ with size $r^{O(k)} \cdot n$ such that $Q$ contains an witness set of size $k$ (if exists). This leads to an exact algorithm for {\sc WS} problem in monotone polygons running in time $r^{O(k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$. We also provide a PTAS for this with running time $r^{O(1/ε)} n^2$.

Authors: Mujin Choi, Maximilian Gorsky, Gunwoo Kim, Caleb McFarland, Sebastian Wiederrecht

We introduce the tree-decomposition-based graph parameter Odd-Cycle-Packing-treewidth (OCP-tw) as a width parameter that asks to decompose a given graph into pieces of bounded odd cycle packing number. The parameter OCP-tw is monotone under the odd-minor-relation and we provide an analogue to the celebrated Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for OCP-tw. That is, we identify two infinite families of grid-like graphs whose presence as odd-minors implies large OCP-tw and prove that their absence implies bounded OCP-tw. This structural result is constructive and implies a 2^(poly(k))poly(n)-time parameterized poly(k)-approximation algorithm for OCP-tw.
  Moreover, we show that the (weighted) Maximum Independent Set problem (MIS) can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded OCP-tw. Finally, we lift the concept of OCP-tw to a parameter for matrices of integer programs. To this end, we show that our strategy can be applied to efficiently solve integer programs whose matrices can be "tree-decomposed" into totally delta-modular matrices with at most two non-zero entries per row.

### 1. [Testing H-freeness on sparse graphs, the case of bounded expansion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10230v1)

Authors: Samuel Humeau, Mamadou Moustapha Kanté, Daniel Mock, Timothé Picavet, Alexandre Vigny

In property testing, a tester makes queries to (an oracle for) a graph and, on a graph having or being far from having a property P, it decides with high probability whether the graph satisfies P or not. Often, testers are restricted to a constant number of queries. While the graph properties for which there exists such a tester are somewhat well characterized in the dense graph model, it is not the case for sparse graphs. In this area, Czumaj and Sohler (FOCS'19) proved that H-freeness (i.e. the property of excluding the graph H as a subgraph) can be tested with constant queries on planar graphs as well as on graph classes excluding a minor.
  Using results from the sparsity toolkit, we propose a simpler alternative to the proof of Czumaj and Sohler, for a statement generalized to the broader notion of bounded expansion. That is, we prove that for any class C with bounded expansion and any graph H, testing H-freeness can be done with constant query complexity on any graph G in C, where the constant depends on H and C, but is independent of G.
  While classes excluding a minor are prime examples of classes with bounded expansion, so are, for example, cubic graphs, graph classes with bounded maximum degree, graphs of bounded book thickness, or random graphs of bounded average degree.

### 2. [Faster All-Pairs Minimum Cut: Bypassing Exact Max-Flow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10036v1)

Authors: Yotam Kenneth-Mordoch, Robert Krauthgamer

All-Pairs Minimum Cut (APMC) is a fundamental graph problem that asks to find a minimum $s,t$-cut for every pair of vertices $s,t$. A recent line of work on fast algorithms for APMC has culminated with a reduction of APMC to $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$-many max-flow computations. But unfortunately, no fast algorithms are currently known for exact max-flow in several standard models of computation, such as the cut-query model and the fully-dynamic model.
  Our main technical contribution is a sparsifier that preserves all minimum $s,t$-cuts in an unweighted graph, and can be constructed using only approximate max-flow computations. We then use this sparsifier to devise new algorithms for APMC in unweighted graphs in several computational models: (i) a randomized algorithm that makes $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ cut queries to the input graph; (ii) a deterministic fully-dynamic algorithm with $n^{3/2+o(1)}$ worst-case update time; and (iii) a randomized two-pass streaming algorithm with space requirement $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$. These results improve over the known bounds, even for (single pair) minimum $s,t$-cut in the respective models.

### 3. [Algorithms and Complexity of Hedge Cluster Deletion Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10202v1)

Authors: Athanasios L. Konstantinidis, Charis Papadopoulos, Georgios Velissaris

A hedge graph is a graph whose edge set has been partitioned into groups called hedges. Here we consider a generalization of the well-known \textsc{Cluster Deletion} problem, named \textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion}. The task is to compute the minimum number of hedges of a hedge graph so that their removal results in a graph that is isomorphic to a disjoint union of cliques. We show that for graphs that contain bounded size of vertex-disjoint 3-vertex-paths as subgraphs, \textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} can be solved in polynomial time. Regarding its approximability, we prove that the problem is tightly connected to the related complexity of the \textsc{Min Horn Deletion} problem, a well-known boolean CSP problem. Our connection shows that it is NP-hard to approximate \textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} within factor $2^{O(\log^{1-ε} r)}$ for any $ε>0$, where $r$ is the number of hedges in a given hedge graph.
  Based on its classified (in)approximability and the difficulty imposed by the structure of almost all non-trivial graphs, we consider the hedge underlying structure. We give a polynomial-time algorithm with constant approximation ratio for \textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} whenever each triangle of the input graph is covered by at most two hedges. On the way to this result, an interesting ingredient that we solved efficiently is a variant of the \textsc{Vertex Cover} problem in which apart from the desired vertex set that covers the edge set, a given set of vertex-constraints should also be included in the solution. Moreover, as a possible workaround for the existence of efficient exact algorithms, we propose the hedge intersection graph which is the intersection graph spanned by the hedges. Towards this direction, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for \textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} whenever the hedge intersection graph is acyclic.

### 4. [Learning Intersections of Halfspaces under Factorizable Distribution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09832v1)

Authors: Ilias Diakonikolas, Mingchen Ma, Lisheng Ren, Christos Tzamos

Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $γ$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/γ))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).
  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/γ)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.
  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.

### 5. [Hardness of Dynamic Tree Edit Distance and Friends](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09842v1)

Authors: Bingbing Hu, Jakob Nogler, Barna Saha

String Edit Distance is a more-than-classical problem whose behavior in the dynamic setting, where the strings are updated over time, is well understood. A single character substitution, insertion, or deletion can be handled in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n \cdot \min(\sqrt{n},w))$ time [Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, Mozes, CPM 2020], where $w$ is the maximum operation weight. This bound is optimal [Cassis, Kociumaka, Wellnitz, FOCS 2023] and provides a substantial improvement over the static $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm when few characters of the input string are updated.
  In contrast, for inherently related problems such as Tree Edit Distance, Dyck Edit Distance, and RNA Folding, it has remained unknown whether it is possible to devise dynamic algorithms with an advantage over the static algorithm. In this paper, we resolve this question by showing that (weighted) Tree Edit Distance, Dyck Edit Distance, and RNA Folding admit no dynamic speedup: under well-known fine-grained assumptions we show that the best possible algorithm recomputes the solution from scratch after each update. Furthermore, we prove a quadratic per-update lower bound for unweighted Tree Edit Distance under the $k$-Clique Conjecture. This provides the first separation between dynamic unweighted String Edit Distance and unweighted Tree Edit Distance, problems whose relative difficulty in the static setting is still open.

Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.

Authors: Thanasis Lianeas, Marios Mertzanidis, Aikaterini Nikolidaki

In Facility Location problems there are agents that should be connected to facilities and locations where facilities may be opened so that agents can connect to them. We depart from Uncapacitated Facility Location and by assuming that the connection costs of agents to facilities are congestion dependent, we define a novel problem, namely, Facility Location for Congesting (Selfish) Commuters. The connection costs of agents to facilities come as a result of how the agents commute to reach the facilities in an underlying network with cost functions on the edges. Inapproximability results follow from the related literature and thus approximate solutions is all we can hope for. For when the cost functions are nondecreasing we employ in a novel way an approximate version of Caratheodory's Theorem [5] to show how approximate solutions for different versions of the problem can be derived. For when the cost functions are nonincreasing we show how this problem generalizes the Cost-Distance problem [38] and provide an algorithm that for this more general case achieves the same approximation guarantees.

### 2. [Robust Resource Allocation via Competitive Subsidies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09934v1)

Authors: David X. Lin, Giannis Fikioris, Siddhartha Banerjee, Éva Tardos

A canonical setting for non-monetary online resource allocation is one where agents compete over multiple rounds for a single item per round, with i.i.d. valuations and additive utilities across rounds. With $n$ symmetric agents, a natural benchmark for each agent is the utility realized by her favorite $1/n$-fraction of rounds; a line of work has demonstrated one can robustly guarantee each agent a constant fraction of this ideal utility, irrespective of how other agents behave. In particular, several mechanisms have been shown to be $1/2$-robust, and recent work established that repeated first-price auctions based on artificial credits have a robustness factor of $0.59$, which cannot be improved beyond $0.6$ using first-price and simple strategies. In contrast, even without strategic considerations, the best achievable factor is $1-1/e\approx 0.63$.
  In this work, we break the $0.6$ first-price barrier to get a new $0.625$-robust mechanism, which almost closes the gap to the non-strategic robustness bound. Surprisingly, we do so via a simple auction, where in each round, bidders decide if they ask for the item, and we allocate uniformly at random among those who ask. The main new ingredient is the idea of competitive subsidies, wherein we charge the winning agent an amount in artificial credits that decreases when fewer agents are bidding (specifically, when $k$ agents bid, then the winner pays proportional to $k/(k+1)$, varying the payment by a factor of 2 depending on the competition). Moreover, we show how it can be modified to get an equilibrium strategy with a slightly weaker robust guarantee of $5/(3e) \approx 0.61$ (and the optimal $1-1/e$ factor at equilibrium). Finally, we show that our mechanism gives the best possible bound under a wide class of auction-based mechanisms.

Authors: Ulrike Schmidt-Kraepelin, Warut Suksompong, Steven Wijaya

Apportionment refers to the well-studied problem of allocating legislative seats among parties or groups with different entitlements. We present a multi-level generalization of apportionment where the groups form a hierarchical structure, which gives rise to stronger versions of the upper and lower quota notions. We show that running Adams' method level-by-level satisfies upper quota, while running Jefferson's method or the quota method level-by-level guarantees lower quota. Moreover, we prove that both quota notions can always be fulfilled simultaneously.

### 4. [Truth, Justice, and Secrecy: Cake Cutting Under Privacy Constraints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09882v1)

Authors: Yaron Salman, Tamir Tassa, Omer Lev, Roie Zivan

Cake-cutting algorithms, which aim to fairly allocate a continuous resource based on individual agent preferences, have seen significant progress over the past two decades. Much of the research has concentrated on fairness, with comparatively less attention given to other important aspects. Chen et al. (2010) introduced an algorithm that, in addition to ensuring fairness, was strategyproof -- meaning agents had no incentive to misreport their valuations. However, even in the absence of strategic incentives to misreport, agents may still hesitate to reveal their true preferences due to privacy concerns (e.g., when allocating advertising time between firms, revealing preferences could inadvertently expose planned marketing strategies or product launch timelines). In this work, we extend the strategyproof algorithm of Chen et al. by introducing a privacy-preserving dimension. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first private cake-cutting protocol, and, in addition, this protocol is also envy-free and strategyproof. Our approach replaces the algorithm's centralized computation with a novel adaptation of cryptographic techniques, enabling privacy without compromising fairness or strategyproofness. Thus, our protocol encourages agents to report their true preferences not only because they are not incentivized to lie, but also because they are protected from having their preferences exposed.

### 5. [Massively Parallel Proof-Number Search for Impartial Games and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10339v1)

Authors: Tomáš Čížek, Martin Balko, Martin Schmid

Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our solver achieves a significantly improved 332.9$\times$ speedup when run on 1024 cores, enabling it to outperform the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime and to generate proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.

### 1. [Leveraging Large Language Models for Identifying Knowledge Components](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09935v1)

Authors: Canwen Wang, Jionghao Lin, Kenneth R. Koedinger

Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

### 3. [FineSkiing: A Fine-grained Benchmark for Skiing Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10250v1)

Authors: Yongji Zhang, Siqi Li, Yue Gao, Yu Jiang

Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Authors: Jose Berengueres

Repetitive strain injury (RSI) affects roughly one in five computer users and remains largely unresolved despite decades of ergonomic mouse redesign. All such devices share a fundamental limitation: they still require fine-motor motion to operate. This work investigates whether predictive, AI-assisted input can reduce that motion by replacing physical pointing with ranked on-screen suggestions. To preserve user agency, we introduce Preview Accept Discard (PAD), a zero-click interaction paradigm that lets users preview predicted GUI targets, cycle through a small set of ranked alternatives, and accept or discard them via key-release timing. We evaluate PAD in two settings: a browser-based email client and a ISO 9241-9 keyboard-prediction task under varying top-3 accuracies. Across both studies, PAD substantially reduces hand motion relative to trackpad use while maintaining comparable task times with the trackpad only when accuracies are similar to those of the best spell-checkers.

Authors: Maximilian Eder, Clemens Lechner, Maurice Jakesch

Interactions with AI assistants are increasingly personalized to individual users. As AI personalization is dynamic and machine-learning-driven, we have limited understanding of how personalization affects interaction outcomes and user perceptions. We conducted a large-scale controlled experiment in which 1,000 participants interacted with AI assistants that took on certain personality traits and opinion stances. Our results show that participants consistently preferred to interact with models that shared their opinions. Participants also found opinion-aligned models more trustworthy, competent, warm, and persuasive, corroborating an AI-similarity-attraction hypothesis. In contrast, we observed no or only weak effects of AI personality alignment, with introvert models rated as less trustworthy and competent by introvert participants. These findings highlight opinion alignment as a central dimension of AI personalization and user preference, while underscoring the need for a more grounded discussion of the limits and risks of personalized AI.

Authors: Sahibzada Farhan Amin, Sana Athar, Anja Feldmann, Ha Dao, Mannat Kaur

Internet measurement research is essential for understanding, improving, and securing Internet infrastructure. However, its methods often involve large-scale data collection and user observation, raising complex ethical questions. While recent research has identified ethical challenges in Internet measurement research and laid out best practices, little is known about how researchers actually make ethical decisions in their research practice. To understand how these practices take shape day-to-day from the perspective of Internet measurement researchers, we interviewed 16 researchers from an Internet measurement research group in the EU. Through thematic analysis, we find that researchers deal with five main ethical challenges: privacy and consent issues, the possibility of unintended harm, balancing transparency with security and accountability, uncertain ethical boundaries, and hurdles in the ethics review process. Researchers address these by lab testing, rate limiting, setting up clear communication channels, and relying heavily on mentors and colleagues for guidance. Researchers express that ethical requirements vary across institutions, jurisdictions and conferences, and ethics review boards often lack the technical knowledge to evaluate Internet measurement research. We also highlight the invisible labor of Internet measurement researchers and describe their ethics practices as craft knowledge, both of which are crucial in upholding responsible research practices in the Internet measurement community.

Authors: Yichen Gao, Menghan Hu, Gang Luo

Providing haptic feedback via smartphone touch screen may potentially offer blind people a capability to understand graphs. This study investigated the discrimination performance of haptic gratings in different frequencies, in both visually impaired (VI) and sighted (S) individuals. 6 VI participants and 10 S participants took part in two experiments designed to compare their ability to interpret grating images with a finger swiping across a smartphone touchscreen without vision. The swipe gesture activates phone vibration temporally synchronized with the black stripes. Their tasks were: (1) determining whether a grating pattern is presented on the touchscreen, (2) comparing two different grating frequencies and determining the wider one. Results demonstrated that the VI group exhibited superior tactile sensitivity compared to the S group, as evidenced by their significantly better performance in Experiment 1 (accuracy of 99.15\% vs. 84.5\%). Experiment 2 revealed that the peak performance of VI participants was approximately around 0.270 cycles per mm (83.3\% accuracy), a frequency very similar to Braille dot spacing, while S group peaked around 0.963 cycles per mm (70\% accuracy). The findings suggest that tactile stimulation coded with grating patterns could be potentially used to present interpretable graph for the visually impaired. Such an approach could offer a value to research in human-computer interaction and sensory adaptation.

Authors: Mehedi Hasan Raju, Oleg V. Komogortsev

This study examines the effectiveness of the real-time privacy-preserving techniques through an offline gaze-based interaction simulation framework. Those techniques aim to reduce the amount of identity-related information in eye-tracking data while improving the efficacy of the gaze-based interaction. Although some real-time gaze privatization methods were previously explored, their validation on the large dataset was not conducted. We propose a functional framework that allows to study the efficacy of real-time gaze privatization on an already collected offline dataset. The key metric used to assess the reduction of identity-related information is the identification rate, while improvements in gaze-based interactions are evaluated through signal quality during interaction. Our additional contribution is the employment of an extremely lightweight Kalman filter framework that reduces the amount of identity-related information in the gaze signal and improves gaze-based interaction performance.

Authors: Juliana Nieto-Cardenas, Erin Joy Kramer, Peter Kurto, Ethan Dickey, Andres Bejarano

We present Owlgorithm, an educational platform that supports Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in competitive programming (CP) through AI-generated reflective questions. Leveraging GPT-4o, Owlgorithm produces context-aware, metacognitive prompts tailored to individual student submissions. Integrated into a second- and third-year CP course, the system-provided reflective prompts adapted to student outcomes: guiding deeper conceptual insight for correct solutions and structured debugging for partial or failed ones.
  Our exploratory assessment of student ratings and TA feedback revealed both promising benefits and notable limitations. While many found the generated questions useful for reflection and debugging, concerns were raised about feedback accuracy and classroom usability. These results suggest advantages of LLM-supported reflection for novice programmers, though refinements are needed to ensure reliability and pedagogical value for advanced learners.
  From our experience, several key insights emerged: GenAI can effectively support structured reflection, but careful prompt design, dynamic adaptation, and usability improvements are critical to realizing their potential in education. We offer specific recommendations for educators using similar tools and outline next steps to enhance Owlgorithm's educational impact. The underlying framework may also generalize to other reflective learning contexts.

Authors: Carlos Deleon, Dmitri Gavrilov, Peggy ODay, Ajith Pattammattel

We present X-AutoMap, a modular framework for autonomous X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping that enables chemically informed targeting of regions of interest through a correlative feature detection strategy. The system integrates classical computer vision and rule-based logic to identify features based on spatial relationships across multiple elemental maps, rather than relying solely on intensity or morphology. Tight integration with the Bluesky control infrastructure at the NSLS-II Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline enables real-time, closed-loop scan orchestration. Applied to a chemically heterogeneous urban PM2.5 sample, X-AutoMap reduced high-resolution acquisition time from over 44 hours to approximately 10 hours by targeting compositionally significant features identified from coarse scans. High-resolution results revealed diverse particle types, including fully mixed, partially overlapping, and spatially distinct multi-element structures, demonstrating the ability of the framework to isolate chemically relevant features with minimal user intervention. The framework supports interactive and autonomous modes, operates within hardware constraints via grid-based scanning, and is robust across varying sample conditions. Future extensions will incorporate machine learning and probabilistic sampling to further improve detection sensitivity and scan efficiency. X-AutoMap is currently in active use at HXN and provides a flexible foundation for scalable, intelligent imaging workflows at synchrotron beamlines.

Authors: Martin Braas, Lukas Esterle

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, yet their applicability to dialogue systems in computer games remains limited. This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.

As an intelligent infrastructure connecting users with commercial content, advertising recommendation systems play a central role in information flow and value creation within the digital economy. However, existing multi-stage advertising recommendation systems suffer from objective misalignment and error propagation, making it difficult to achieve global optimality, while unified generative recommendation models still struggle to meet the demands of practical industrial applications. To address these issues, we propose GPR (Generative Pre-trained Recommender), the first one-model framework that redefines advertising recommendation as an end-to-end generative task, replacing the traditional cascading paradigm with a unified generative approach. To realize GPR, we introduce three key innovations spanning unified representation, network architecture, and training strategy. First, we design a unified input schema and tokenization method tailored to advertising scenarios, mapping both ads and organic content into a shared multi-level semantic ID space, thereby enhancing semantic alignment and modeling consistency across heterogeneous data. Second, we develop the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Decoder (HHD), a dual-decoder architecture that decouples user intent modeling from ad generation, achieving a balance between training efficiency and inference flexibility while maintaining strong modeling capacity. Finally, we propose a multi-stage joint training strategy that integrates Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Value-Aware Fine-Tuning and the Hierarchy Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO) algorithm, forming a complete generative recommendation pipeline that unifies interest modeling, value alignment, and policy optimization. GPR has been fully deployed in the Tencent Weixin Channels advertising system, delivering significant improvements in key business metrics including GMV and CTCVR.

Authors: Yunkai Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Feng, Lin, Ruizhong Qiu, Hanchao Yu, Jason Liu, Yinglong Xia, Zhuoran Yu, Zeyu Zheng, Diji Yang

Optimizing recommender systems for objectives beyond accuracy, such as diversity, novelty, and personalization, is crucial for long-term user satisfaction. To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner.
  Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.

### 1. [Steering Pretrained Drafters during Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09844v1)

Authors: Frédéric Berdoz, Peer Rheinboldt, Roger Wattenhofer

Speculative decoding accelerates language model inference by separating generation into fast drafting and parallel verification. Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\% under standard sampling and 22\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead. Importantly, our approach can be retrofitted to existing architectures and pretrained models, enabling rapid adoption.

### 2. [Belief Net: A Filter-Based Framework for Learning Hidden Markov Models from Observations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10571v1)

Authors: Reginald Zhiyan Chen, Heng-Sheng Chang, Prashant G. Mehta

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.

### 3. [Maximizing Efficiency of Dataset Compression for Machine Learning Potentials With Information Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10561v1)

Authors: Benjamin Yu, Vincenzo Lordi, Daniel Schwalbe-Koda

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

Authors: Isabela Albuquerque, Ira Ktena, Olivia Wiles, Ivana Kajić, Amal Rannen-Triki, Cristina Vasconcelos, Aida Nematzadeh

Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

### 5. [Product distribution learning with imperfect advice](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10366v1)

Authors: Arnab Bhattacharyya, Davin Choo, Philips George John, Themis Gouleakis

Given i.i.d.~samples from an unknown distribution $P$, the goal of distribution learning is to recover the parameters of a distribution that is close to $P$. When $P$ belongs to the class of product distributions on the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^d$, it is known that $Ω(d/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to learn $P$ within total variation (TV) distance $\varepsilon$. We revisit this problem when the learner is also given as advice the parameters of a product distribution $Q$. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to learn $P$ within TV distance $\varepsilon$ that has sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d^{1-η}/\varepsilon^2)$, if $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1 < \varepsilon d^{0.5 - Ω(η)}$. Here, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are the mean vectors of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and no bound on $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1$ is known to the algorithm a priori.

Authors: Adrien Lafage, Olivier Laurent, Firas Gabetni, Gianni Franchi

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Although numerous techniques have been proposed, a unified tool offering a seamless workflow to evaluate and integrate these methods remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce Torch-Uncertainty, a PyTorch and Lightning-based framework designed to streamline DNN training and evaluation with UQ techniques and metrics. In this paper, we outline the foundational principles of our library and present comprehensive experimental results that benchmark a diverse set of UQ methods across classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Our library is available at https://github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/Torch-Uncertainty

Authors: Jianghan Zhu, Yaoxin Wu, Zhuoyi Lin, Zhengyuan Zhang, Haiyan Yin, Zhiguang Cao, Senthilnath Jayavelu, Xiaoli Li

Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have significantly improved the capability of neural solvers to handle synthetic routing instances. Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.

### 8. [FedCure: Mitigating Participation Bias in Semi-Asynchronous Federated Learning with Non-IID Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10227v1)

Authors: Yue Chen, Jianfeng Lu, Shuqing Cao, Wei Wang, Gang Li, Guanghui Wen

While semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) combines the efficiency of synchronous training with the flexibility of asynchronous updates, it inherently suffers from participation bias, which is further exacerbated by non-IID data distributions. More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

### 9. [Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection via Variational Domain-Invariant Learning with Test-Time Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10213v1)

Authors: Xi Yang, Han Zhang, Zhijian Lin, Yibiao Hu, Hong Han

Out-of-context misinformation (OOC) is a low-cost form of misinformation in news reports, which refers to place authentic images into out-of-context or fabricated image-text pairings. This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

### 10. [DenoGrad: Deep Gradient Denoising Framework for Enhancing the Performance of Interpretable AI Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10161v1)

Authors: J. Javier Alonso-Ramos, Ignacio Aguilera-Martos, Andrés Herrera-Poyatos, Francisco Herrera

The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.

Authors: Zhanhong Fang, Debing Wang, Jinbiao Chen, Jiahai Wang, Zizhen Zhang

Neural solvers have demonstrated remarkable success in combinatorial optimization, often surpassing traditional heuristics in speed, solution quality, and generalization. However, their efficacy deteriorates significantly when confronted with complex constraints that cannot be effectively managed through simple masking mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce Universal Constrained Preference Optimization (UCPO), a novel plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates preference learning into existing neural solvers via a specially designed loss function, without requiring architectural modifications. UCPO embeds constraint satisfaction directly into a preference-based objective, eliminating the need for meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Leveraging a lightweight warm-start fine-tuning protocol, UCPO enables pre-trained models to consistently produce near-optimal, feasible solutions on challenging constraint-laden tasks, achieving exceptional performance with as little as 1\% of the original training budget.

### 1. [See and Beam: Leveraging LiDAR Sensing and Specular Surfaces for Indoor mmWave Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09840v1)

Authors: Raj Sai Sohel Bandari, Amod Ashtekar, Omar Ibrahim, Mohammed E. Eltayeb

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication enables multi-gigabit-per-second data rates but is highly susceptible to path loss and blockage, especially indoors. Many indoor settings, however, include naturally occurring specular surfaces such as glass, glossy metal panels, and signage, that reflect both light and mmWave signals. Exploiting this dual reflectivity, we propose See and Beam, a low-cost framework that combines LiDAR sensing with passive specular reflectors to enhance mmWave connectivity under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. In this paper, as a proof of concept, we deploy three types of reflectors, glossy, smooth, and matte (non-specular), to evaluate joint LiDAR/mmWave reflection in an indoor scenario. We demonstrate that using LiDAR-mmWave co-reflective surfaces enables a co-located LiDAR sensor to map the NLoS environment, localize NLoS users, and identify viable communication reflection points. Experimental results at 60 GHz show that LiDAR-guided beam steering with co-reflective surfaces improves the minimum received signal strength by over 20 dB in deep NLoS regions. Moreover, LiDAR-derived angle-of-departure steering achieves performance comparable to exhaustive NLoS beam search. This low cost, and scalable framework serves as an effective alternative to configurable reflecting surfaces and enables robust mmWave connectivity in future 6G and beyond networks.

Authors: Alagappan Ramanathan, Eunju Kang, Dongsu Han, Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi

Internet measurement research faces an accessibility crisis: complex analyses require custom integration of multiple specialized tools that demands specialized domain expertise. When network disruptions occur, operators need rapid diagnostic workflows spanning infrastructure mapping, routing analysis, and dependency modeling. However, developing these workflows requires specialized knowledge and significant manual effort.
  We present ArachNet, the first system demonstrating that LLM agents can independently generate measurement workflows that mimics expert reasoning. Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination. ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis.

Authors: Miguel Casasnovas, Francesc Wilhelmi, Richard Combes, Maksymilian Wojnar, Katarzyna Kosek-Szott, Szymon Szott, Anders Jonsson, Luis Esteve, Boris Bellalta

Due to its static protocol design, IEEE 802.11 (aka Wi-Fi) channel access lacks adaptability to address dynamic network conditions, resulting in inefficient spectrum utilization, unnecessary contention, and packet collisions. This paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to optimize Wi-Fi's medium access control (MAC). In particular, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is proposed for dynamic channel access (including both the primary channel and channel width) and contention window (CW) adjustment. In this setting, we study relevant learning design principles such as adopting joint or factorial action spaces (handled by a single agent (SA) and multiple agents (MA), respectively) and the importance of incorporating contextual information. Our simulation results show that cooperative MA architectures converge faster than their SA counterparts, as agents operate over smaller action spaces. Another key insight is that contextual MAB algorithms consistently outperform non-contextual ones, highlighting the value of leveraging side information in action selection. Moreover, in multi-player settings, results demonstrate that decentralized learners can achieve implicit coordination, although their greediness may degrade coexisting networks' performance and induce policy-chasing dynamics. Overall, these findings demonstrate that (contextual) MAB-based learning offers a practical and adaptive alternative to static IEEE 802.11 protocols, enabling more efficient and intelligent spectrum utilization.

Authors: Aswin Arun, Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas, Rimalpudi Sarvendranath, Walid Saad

Despite the advantages of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for wireless use case such as medium access control (MAC), their real-world deployment in Internet of Things (IoT) is hindered by their sample inefficiency. To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy. The resulting combination of sample efficiency and interpretability establishes causal MBRL as a practical approach for resource-constrained wireless systems.

Authors: Rinieri Lorenzo, Gori Giacomo, Melis Andrea, Girau Roberto, Prandini Marco, Callegati Franco

The OPC UA protocol is becoming the de facto standard for Industry 4.0 machine-to-machine communication. It stands out as one of the few industrial protocols that provide robust security features designed to prevent attackers from manipulating and damaging critical infrastructures. However, prior works showed that significant challenges still exists to set up secure OPC UA deployments in practice, mainly caused by the complexity of certificate management in industrial scenarios and the inconsistent implementation of security features across industrial OPC UA devices. In this paper, we present Pk-IOTA, an automated solution designed to secure OPC UA communications by integrating programmable data plane switches for in-network certificate validation and leveraging the IOTA Tangle for decen- tralized certificate distribution. Our evaluation is performed on a physical testbed representing a real-world industrial scenario and shows that Pk-IOTA introduces a minimal overhead while providing a scalable and tamper-proof mechanism for OPC UA certificate management.

Authors: Fabian Ihle, Moritz Flüchter, Michael Menth

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of IEEE standards that extends Ethernet with real-time capabilities. Among its mechanisms, TSN can coordinate transmission times network-wide to minimize queueing, ensuring low latency and bounded delay. This coordination is computed offline and yields a network-wide schedule. The Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), implemented in TSN bridges, protects high-priority scheduled traffic from lower-priority (best-effort) flows by periodically opening and closing priority queues according to this schedule. Deterministic Networking (DetNet), standardized by the IETF, provides similar guarantees at Layer 3 and can leverage TSN mechanisms such as TAS for that purpose. Commercially available TSN-capable switches typically implement TAS in hardware but rarely disclose internal processing delays such as queue opening latency. Such information is essential for precise scheduling but largely unavailable to system designers. In this work, we present P4-TAS, a P4-based implementation of the TAS on a hardware switching ASIC. Our design introduces a novel approach for periodic queue control using a continuous stream of internally generated TAS control frames. We identify and quantify three sources of internal delay on a nanosecond scale which also exist in other implementations that directly affect the precision of executed schedules, providing transparency for future implementations and scheduling algorithms. Moreover, we provide an MPLS/TSN translation layer that enables P4-TAS to operate within DetNet environments, allowing TSN time-based traffic shaping to be carried over high-speed 400 Gb/s forwarding. Finally, we evaluate the scalability of P4-TAS and compare it to available TAS implementations.

Authors: Jaime Sebastian Burbano, Arnova Abdullah, Eldiyar Zhantileuov, Mohan Liyanage, Rolf Schuster

Latency-sensitive embedded applications increasingly rely on edge computing, yet dynamic network congestion in multi-server architectures challenges proper edge server selection. This paper proposes a lightweight server-selection method for edge applications that fuses latency prediction with adaptive reliability and hysteresis-based handover. Using passive measurements (arrival rate, utilization, payload size) and an exponentially modulated rational delay model, the proposed Moderate Handover (MO-HAN) method computes a score that balances predicted latency and reliability to ensure handovers occur only when the expected gain is meaningful and maintain reduced end-to-end latency. Results show that MO-HAN consistently outperforms static and fair-distribution baselines by lowering mean and tail latencies, while reducing handovers by nearly 50% compared to pure opportunistic selection. These gains arise without intrusive instrumentation or heavy learning infrastructure, making MO-HAN practical for resource-constrained embedded devices.

### 1. [Safe Planning in Interactive Environments via Iterative Policy Updates and Adversarially Robust Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10586v1)

Authors: Omid Mirzaeedodangeh, Eliot Shekhtman, Nikolai Matni, Lars Lindemann

Safe planning of an autonomous agent in interactive environments -- such as the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles -- poses a major challenge as the behavior of the environment is unknown and reactive to the behavior of the autonomous agent. This coupling gives rise to interaction-driven distribution shifts where the autonomous agent's control policy may change the environment's behavior, thereby invalidating safety guarantees in existing work. Indeed, recent works have used conformal prediction (CP) to generate distribution-free safety guarantees using observed data of the environment. However, CP's assumption on data exchangeability is violated in interactive settings due to a circular dependency where a control policy update changes the environment's behavior, and vice versa. To address this gap, we propose an iterative framework that robustly maintains safety guarantees across policy updates by quantifying the potential impact of a planned policy update on the environment's behavior. We realize this via adversarially robust CP where we perform a regular CP step in each episode using observed data under the current policy, but then transfer safety guarantees across policy updates by analytically adjusting the CP result to account for distribution shifts. This adjustment is performed based on a policy-to-trajectory sensitivity analysis, resulting in a safe, episodic open-loop planner. We further conduct a contraction analysis of the system providing conditions under which both the CP results and the policy updates are guaranteed to converge. We empirically demonstrate these safety and convergence guarantees on a two-dimensional car-pedestrian case study. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results that provide valid safety guarantees in such interactive settings.

Authors: Tianhui Han, Shashwat Singh, Sarvesh Patil, Zeynep Temel

Origami-inspired mechanisms can transform flat sheets into functional three-dimensional dynamic structures that are lightweight, compact, and capable of complex motion. These properties make origami increasingly valuable in robotic and deployable systems. However, accurately simulating their folding behavior and interactions with the environment remains challenging. To address this, we present a design framework for origami mechanism simulation that utilizes MuJoCo's deformable-body capabilities. In our approach, origami sheets are represented as graphs of interconnected deformable elements with user-specified constraints such as creases and actuation, defined through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This framework allows users to generate physically consistent simulations that capture both the geometric structure of origami mechanisms and their interactions with external objects and surfaces. We demonstrate our method's utility through a case study on an origami catapult, where design parameters are optimized in simulation using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and validated experimentally on physical prototypes. The optimized structure achieves improved throwing performance, illustrating how our system enables rapid, simulation-driven origami design, optimization, and analysis.

Authors: Wei Li, Renshan Zhang, Rui Shao, Zhijian Fang, Kaiwen Zhou, Zhuotao Tian, Liqiang Nie

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

### 4. [MSGNav: Unleashing the Power of Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph for Zero-Shot Embodied Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10376v1)

Authors: Xun Huang, Shijia Zhao, Yunxiang Wang, Xin Lu, Wanfa Zhang, Rongsheng Qu, Weixin Li, Yunhong Wang, Chenglu Wen

Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

Authors: Stephane Da Silva Martins, Emanuel Aldea, Sylvie Le Hégarat-Mascle

Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Authors: Yizheng Wang, Timon Rabczuk, Yinghua Liu

Friction modeling plays a crucial role in achieving high-precision motion control in robotic operating systems. Traditional static friction models (such as the Stribeck model) are widely used due to their simple forms; however, they typically require predefined functional assumptions, which poses significant challenges when dealing with unknown functional structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a physics-inspired machine learning approach based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) for static friction modeling of robotic joints. The method integrates spline activation functions with a symbolic regression mechanism, enabling model simplification and physical expression extraction through pruning and attribute scoring, while maintaining both high prediction accuracy and interpretability. We first validate the method's capability to accurately identify key parameters under known functional models, and further demonstrate its robustness and generalization ability under conditions with unknown functional structures and noisy data. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real friction data collected from a six-degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator show that the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination greater than 0.95 across various tasks and successfully extracts concise and physically meaningful friction expressions. This study provides a new perspective for interpretable and data-driven robotic friction modeling with promising engineering applicability.

Authors: Egor Davydenko, Andrei Volchenkov, Vladimir Gerasimov, Roman Gorbachev

In this paper, we propose a novel design of an electrically actuated robotic leg, called the DecARt (Decoupled Actuation Robot) Leg, aimed at performing agile locomotion. This design incorporates several new features, such as the use of a quasi-telescopic kinematic structure with rotational motors for decoupled actuation, a near-anthropomorphic leg appearance with a forward facing knee, and a novel multi-bar system for ankle torque transmission from motors placed above the knee. To analyze the agile locomotion capabilities of the design numerically, we propose a new descriptive metric, called the `Fastest Achievable Swing Time` (FAST), and perform a quantitative evaluation of the proposed design and compare it with other designs. Then we evaluate the performance of the DecARt Leg-based robot via extensive simulation and preliminary hardware experiments.

### 8. [Phantom Menace: Exploring and Enhancing the Robustness of VLA Models against Physical Sensor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10008v1)

Authors: Xuancun Lu, Jiaxiang Chen, Shilin Xiao, Zizhi Jin, Zhangrui Chen, Hanwen Yu, Bohan Qian, Ruochen Zhou, Xiaoyu Ji, Wenyuan Xu

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models revolutionize robotic systems by enabling end-to-end perception-to-action pipelines that integrate multiple sensory modalities, such as visual signals processed by cameras and auditory signals captured by microphones. This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored.
  To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.

### 9. [Audio-VLA: Adding Contact Audio Perception to Vision-Language-Action Model for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09958v1)

Authors: Xiangyi Wei, Haotian Zhang, Xinyi Cao, Siyu Xie, Weifeng Ge, Yang Li, Changbo Wang

The Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have achieved significant advances in robotic manipulation recently. However, vision-only VLA models create fundamental limitations, particularly in perceiving interactive and manipulation dynamic processes. This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities.

### 10. [LongComp: Long-Tail Compositional Zero-Shot Generalization for Robust Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10411v1)

Authors: Benjamin Stoler, Jonathan Francis, Jean Oh

Methods for trajectory prediction in Autonomous Driving must contend with rare, safety-critical scenarios that make reliance on real-world data collection alone infeasible. To assess robustness under such conditions, we propose new long-tail evaluation settings that repartition datasets to create challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets. We first introduce a safety-informed scenario factorization framework, which disentangles scenarios into discrete ego and social contexts. Building on analogies to compositional zero-shot image-labeling in Computer Vision, we then hold out novel context combinations to construct challenging closed-world and open-world settings. This process induces OOD performance gaps in future motion prediction of 5.0% and 14.7% in closed-world and open-world settings, respectively, relative to in-distribution performance for a state-of-the-art baseline. To improve generalization, we extend task-modular gating networks to operate within trajectory prediction models, and develop an auxiliary, difficulty-prediction head to refine internal representations. Our strategies jointly reduce the OOD performance gaps to 2.8% and 11.5% in the two settings, respectively, while still improving in-distribution performance.

Authors: Divyanshu Saxena, Rishikesh Maurya, Xiaoxuan Ou, Gagan Somashekar, Shachee Mishra Gupta, Arun Iyer, Yu Kang, Chetan Bansal, Aditya Akella, Saravan Rajmohan

The rapid adoption of AI agents across domains has made systematic evaluation crucial for ensuring their usefulness and successful production deployment. Evaluation of AI agents typically involves using a fixed set of benchmarks and computing multiple evaluation metrics for the agent. While sufficient for simple coding tasks, these benchmarks fall short for enterprise-scale agents, where services and requirements evolve continuously and ground-truth examples are sparse. We propose a process of benchmark generation that helps evolve the benchmarks as the requirements change and perform robust evaluation of evolving AI agents. We instantiate this approach for a case study of service migration from one deployment platform to another at a large public enterprise. Our approach relies on semi-structured documents where developers express the high-level intent, and uses state-of-the-art LLMs to generate benchmarks from just a small number of such documents. Overall, this process results in a maintainable evaluation framework, enabling rapid feedback on agent performance and facilitating targeted improvements.

### 2. [Quality Assurance of LLM-generated Code: Addressing Non-Functional Quality Characteristics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10271v1)

Authors: Xin Sun, Daniel Ståhl, Kristian Sandahl, Christoph Kessler

In recent years, LLMs have been widely integrated into software engineering workflows, supporting tasks like code generation. However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality.

Authors: Noah van der Vleuten, Anthony Flores, Shray Mathur, Max Rakitin, Thomas Hopkins, Kevin G. Yager, Esther H. R. Tsai

Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for instrument control requires methods that go beyond standard, stateless algorithmic benchmarks, since the behavior of physical systems cannot be fully captured by unit tests alone. Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence. EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation. This is a first step toward a broader vision where LLMs and digital twins work symbiotically: LLMs providing intuitive control and agentic orchestration, and digital twins offering safe and high-fidelity environments, paving the way towards autonomous embodied AI.

### 4. [Towards Comprehensive Sampling of SMT Solutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10326v1)

Authors: Shuangyu Lyu, Chuan Luo, Ruizhi Shi, Wei Wu, Chanjuan Liu, Chunming Hu

This work focuses on effectively generating diverse solutions for satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) formulas, targeting the theories of bit-vectors, arrays, and uninterpreted functions, which is a critical task in software and hardware testing. Generating diverse SMT solutions helps uncover faults and detect safety violations during the verification and testing process, resulting in the SMT sampling problem, i.e., constructing a small number of solutions while achieving comprehensive coverage of the constraint space. While high coverage is crucial for exploring system behaviors, reducing the number of solutions is of great importance, as excessive solutions increase testing time and resource usage, undermining efficiency. In this work, we introduce PanSampler, a novel SMT sampler that achieves high coverage with a small number of solutions. It incorporates three novel techniques, i.e., diversity-aware SMT algorithm, abstract syntax tree (AST)-guided scoring function and post-sampling optimization technology, enhancing its practical performance. It iteratively samples solutions, evaluates candidates, and employs local search to refine solutions, ensuring high coverage with a small number of samples. Extensive experiments on practical benchmarks demonstrate that PanSampler exhibits a significantly stronger capability to reach high target coverage, while requiring fewer solutions than current samplers to achieve the same coverage level. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation on practical subjects, which are collected from real-world software systems, shows that PanSampler achieves higher fault detection capability and reduces the number of required test cases from 32.6\% to 76.4\% to reach the same fault detection effectiveness, leading to a substantial improvement in testing efficiency. PanSampler advances SMT sampling, reducing the cost of software testing and hardware verification.

### 5. [A Large-Scale Collection Of (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10323v1)

Authors: Dávid Kószó, Tamás Aladics, Rudolf Ferenc, Péter Hegedűs

Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools, while invaluable for identifying potential coding problems, functional bugs, or vulnerabilities, often generate an overwhelming number of warnings, many of which are non-actionable. This overload of alerts leads to ``alert fatigue'', a phenomenon where developers become desensitized to warnings, potentially overlooking critical issues and ultimately hindering productivity and code quality. Analyzing these warnings and training machine learning models to identify and filter them requires substantial datasets, which are currently scarce, particularly for Java. This scarcity impedes efforts to improve the accuracy and usability of SCA tools and mitigate the effects of alert fatigue. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel methodology for collecting and categorizing SCA warnings, effectively distinguishing actionable from non-actionable ones. We further leverage this methodology to generate a large-scale dataset of over 1 million entries of Java source code warnings, named NASCAR: (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports. To facilitate follow-up research in this domain, we make both the dataset and the tools used to generate it publicly available.

Authors: Stefano Maria Iacus, Giuseppe Porro

Using 2.6 billion geolocated social-media posts (2014-2022) and a fine-tuned generative language model, we construct county-level indicators of life satisfaction and happiness for the United States. We document an apparent rural-urban paradox: rural counties express higher life satisfaction while urban counties exhibit greater happiness. We reconcile this by treating the two as distinct layers of subjective well-being, evaluative vs. hedonic, showing that each maps differently onto place, politics, and time. Republican-leaning areas appear more satisfied in evaluative terms, but partisan gaps in happiness largely flatten outside major metros, indicating context-dependent political effects. Temporal shocks dominate the hedonic layer: happiness falls sharply during 2020-2022, whereas life satisfaction moves more modestly. These patterns are robust across logistic and OLS specifications and align with well-being theory. Interpreted as associations for the population of social-media posts, the results show that large-scale, language-based indicators can resolve conflicting findings about the rural-urban divide by distinguishing the type of well-being expressed, offering a transparent, reproducible complement to traditional surveys.

Authors: Sahibzada Farhan Amin, Sana Athar, Anja Feldmann, Ha Dao, Mannat Kaur

Internet measurement research is essential for understanding, improving, and securing Internet infrastructure. However, its methods often involve large-scale data collection and user observation, raising complex ethical questions. While recent research has identified ethical challenges in Internet measurement research and laid out best practices, little is known about how researchers actually make ethical decisions in their research practice. To understand how these practices take shape day-to-day from the perspective of Internet measurement researchers, we interviewed 16 researchers from an Internet measurement research group in the EU. Through thematic analysis, we find that researchers deal with five main ethical challenges: privacy and consent issues, the possibility of unintended harm, balancing transparency with security and accountability, uncertain ethical boundaries, and hurdles in the ethics review process. Researchers address these by lab testing, rate limiting, setting up clear communication channels, and relying heavily on mentors and colleagues for guidance. Researchers express that ethical requirements vary across institutions, jurisdictions and conferences, and ethics review boards often lack the technical knowledge to evaluate Internet measurement research. We also highlight the invisible labor of Internet measurement researchers and describe their ethics practices as craft knowledge, both of which are crucial in upholding responsible research practices in the Internet measurement community.

### 3. [Reputation assimilation mechanism for sustaining cooperation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10193v1)

Authors: Siyu He, Qin Li, Minyu Feng, Attila Szolnoki

Keeping a high reputation, by contributing to common efforts, plays a key role in explaining the evolution of collective cooperation among unrelated agents in a complex society. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily an individual feature, but may also reflect the general state of a local community. Consequently, a person with a high reputation becomes attractive not just because we can expect cooperative acts with higher probability, but also because such a person is involved in a more efficient group venture. These observations highlight the cumulative and socially transmissible nature of reputation. Interestingly, these aspects were completely ignored by previous works. To reveal the possible consequences, we introduce a spatial public goods game in which we use an assimilated reputation simultaneously characterizing the individual and its neighbors' reputation. Furthermore, a reputation-dependent synergy factor is used to capture the high (or low) quality of a specific group. Through extensive numerical simulations, we investigate how cooperation and extended reputation co-evolve, thereby revealing the dynamic influence of the assimilated reputation mechanism on the emergence and persistence of cooperation. By fostering social learning from high-reputation individuals and granting payoff advantages to high-reputation groups via an adaptive multiplier, the assimilated reputation mechanism promotes cooperation, ultimately to the systemic level.

### 4. [Simulating Misinformation Propagation in Social Networks using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10384v1)

Authors: Raj Gaurav Maurya, Vaibhav Shukla, Raj Abhijit Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat

Misinformation on social media thrives on surprise, emotion, and identity-driven reasoning, often amplified through human cognitive biases. To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.

Authors: Raman Ebrahimi, Sean Fuhrman, Kendrick Nguyen, Harini Gurusankar, Massimo Franceschetti

The WikiRace game, where players navigate between Wikipedia articles using only hyperlinks, serves as a compelling benchmark for goal-directed search in complex information networks. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of navigation strategies for this task, comparing agents guided by graph-theoretic structure (betweenness centrality), semantic meaning (language model embeddings), and hybrid approaches. Through rigorous benchmarking on a large Wikipedia subgraph, we demonstrate that a purely greedy agent guided by the semantic similarity of article titles is overwhelmingly effective. This strategy, when combined with a simple loop-avoidance mechanism, achieved a perfect success rate and navigated the network with an efficiency an order of magnitude better than structural or hybrid methods. Our findings highlight the critical limitations of purely structural heuristics for goal-directed search and underscore the transformative potential of large language models to act as powerful, zero-shot semantic navigators in complex information spaces.

### 6. [GraphSB: Boosting Imbalanced Node Classification on Graphs through Structural Balance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10022v1)

Authors: Chaofan Zhu, Xiaobing Rui, Zhixiao Wang

Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.

### 1. [Bridging Constraints and Stochasticity: A Fully First-Order Method for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization with Linear Constraints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09845v1)

Authors: Cac Phan

This work provides the first finite-time convergence guarantees for linearly constrained stochastic bilevel optimization using only first-order methods, requiring solely gradient information without any Hessian computations or second-order derivatives. We address the unprecedented challenge of simultaneously handling linear constraints, stochastic noise, and finite-time analysis in bilevel optimization, a combination that has remained theoretically intractable until now. While existing approaches either require second-order information, handle only unconstrained stochastic problems, or provide merely asymptotic convergence results, our method achieves finite-time guarantees using gradient-based techniques alone. We develop a novel framework that constructs hypergradient approximations via smoothed penalty functions, using approximate primal and dual solutions to overcome the fundamental challenges posed by the interaction between linear constraints and stochastic noise. Our theoretical analysis provides explicit finite-time bounds on the bias and variance of the hypergradient estimator, demonstrating how approximation errors interact with stochastic perturbations. We prove that our first-order algorithm converges to $(δ, ε)$-Goldstein stationary points using $Θ(δ^{-1}ε^{-5})$ stochastic gradient evaluations, establishing the first finite-time complexity result for this challenging problem class and representing a significant theoretical breakthrough in constrained stochastic bilevel optimization.

### 2. [Masking criteria for selecting an imputation model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10048v1)

Authors: Yanjiao Yang, Daniel Suen, Yen-Chi Chen

The masking-one-out (MOO) procedure, masking an observed entry and comparing it versus its imputed values, is a very common procedure for comparing imputation models. We study the optimum of this procedure and generalize it to a missing data assumption and establish the corresponding semi-parametric efficiency theory. However, MOO is a measure of prediction accuracy, which is not ideal for evaluating an imputation model. To address this issue, we introduce three modified MOO criteria, based on rank transformation, energy distance, and likelihood principle, that allow us to select an imputation model that properly account for the stochastic nature of data. The likelihood approach further enables an elegant framework of learning an imputation model from the data and we derive its statistical and computational learning theories as well as consistency of BIC model selection. We also show how MOO is related to the missing-at-random assumption. Finally, we introduce the prediction-imputation diagram, a two-dimensional diagram visually comparing both the prediction and imputation utilities for various imputation models.

Authors: Alireza F. Pour, Shai Ben-David

We address the general task of learning with a set of candidate models that is too large to have a uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true losses. While the common approach to such challenges is SRM (or regularization) based learning algorithms, we propose a novel learning paradigm that relies on stronger incorporation of empirical data and requires less algorithmic decisions to be based on prior assumptions. We analyze the generalization capabilities of our approach and demonstrate its merits in several common learning assumptions, including similarity of close points, clustering of the domain into highly label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness assumptions of the labeling rule, and contrastive learning assumptions. Our approach allows utilizing such assumptions without the need to know their true parameters a priori.

### 4. [Theory and computation for structured variational inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09897v1)

Authors: Shunan Sheng, Bohan Wu, Bennett Zhu, Sinho Chewi, Aram-Alexandre Pooladian

Structured variational inference constitutes a core methodology in modern statistical applications. Unlike mean-field variational inference, the approximate posterior is assumed to have interdependent structure. We consider the natural setting of star-structured variational inference, where a root variable impacts all the other ones. We prove the first results for existence, uniqueness, and self-consistency of the variational approximation. In turn, we derive quantitative approximation error bounds for the variational approximation to the posterior, extending prior work from the mean-field setting to the star-structured setting. We also develop a gradient-based algorithm with provable guarantees for computing the variational approximation using ideas from optimal transport theory. We explore the implications of our results for Gaussian measures and hierarchical Bayesian models, including generalized linear models with location family priors and spike-and-slab priors with one-dimensional debiasing. As a by-product of our analysis, we develop new stability results for star-separable transport maps which might be of independent interest.

Authors: Patrick Cattiaux, Paula Cordero-Encinar, Arnaud Guillin

In this work we study the diffusion annealed Langevin dynamics, a score-based diffusion process recently introduced in the theory of generative models and which is an alternative to the classical overdamped Langevin diffusion. Our goal is to provide a rigorous construction and to study the theoretical efficiency of these models for general base distribution as well as target distribution. As a matter of fact these diffusion processes are a particular case of Nelson processes i.e. diffusion processes with a given flow of time marginals.
  Providing existence and uniqueness of the solution to the annealed Langevin diffusion leads to proving a Poincaré inequality for the conditional distribution of $X$ knowing $X+Z=y$ uniformly in $y$, as recently observed by one of us and her coauthors. Part of this work is thus devoted to the study of such Poincaré inequalities. Additionally we show that strengthening the Poincaré inequality into a logarithmic Sobolev inequality improves the efficiency of the model.

### 6. [Incremental Generation is Necessity and Sufficient for Universality in Flow-Based Modelling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09902v1)

Authors: Hossein Rouhvarzi, Anastasis Kratsios

Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.

Authors: Jonghun Lee, YongKyung Oh, Sungil Kim, Dong-Young Lim

Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) excel at modeling continuous-time dynamics, effectively handling challenges such as irregular observations, missing values, and noise. Despite their advantages, NDEs face a fundamental challenge in adopting dropout, a cornerstone of deep learning regularization, making them susceptible to overfitting. To address this research gap, we introduce Continuum Dropout, a universally applicable regularization technique for NDEs built upon the theory of alternating renewal processes. Continuum Dropout formulates the on-off mechanism of dropout as a stochastic process that alternates between active (evolution) and inactive (paused) states in continuous time. This provides a principled approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of NDEs. Moreover, Continuum Dropout offers a structured framework to quantify predictive uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling at test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Continuum Dropout outperforms existing regularization methods for NDEs, achieving superior performance on various time series and image classification tasks. It also yields better-calibrated and more trustworthy probability estimates, highlighting its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware modeling.

### 9. [Randomized batch-sampling Kaczmarz methods for general linear systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09872v1)

Authors: Dong-Yue Xie, Xi Yang

To conduct a more in-depth investigation of randomized solvers for general linear systems, we adopt a unified randomized batch-sampling Kaczmarz framework with per-iteration costs as low as cyclic block methods, and develop a general analysis technique to establish its convergence guarantee. With concentration inequalities, we derive new expected linear convergence rate bounds. The analysis applies to any randomized non-extended block Kaczmarz methods with static stochastic samplings. In addition, the new rate bounds are scale-invariant which eliminate the dependence on the magnitude of the data matrix. In most experiments, the new bounds are significantly tighter than existing ones and better reflect the empirical convergence behavior of block methods. Within this new framework, the batch-sampling distribution, as a learnable parameter, provides the possibility for block methods to achieve efficient performance in specific application scenarios, which deserves further investigation.

### 10. [Operator Models for Continuous-Time Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10383v1)

Authors: Nicolas Hoischen, Petar Bevanda, Max Beier, Stefan Sosnowski, Boris Houska, Sandra Hirche

Continuous-time stochastic processes underlie many natural and engineered systems. In healthcare, autonomous driving, and industrial control, direct interaction with the environment is often unsafe or impractical, motivating offline reinforcement learning from historical data. However, there is limited statistical understanding of the approximation errors inherent in learning policies from offline datasets. We address this by linking reinforcement learning to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and proposing an operator-theoretic algorithm based on a simple dynamic programming recursion. Specifically, we represent our world model in terms of the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes learned in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By integrating statistical learning methods and operator theory, we establish global convergence of the value function and derive finite-sample guarantees with bounds tied to system properties such as smoothness and stability. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that operator-based approaches may hold promise in solving offline reinforcement learning using continuous-time optimal control.

### Artificial Intelligence

### 1. [NEMO: Execution-Aware Optimization Modeling via Autonomous Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21372v1)

Authors: Yang Song, Anoushka Vyas, Zirui Wei, Sina Khoshfetrat Pakazad, Henrik Ohlsson, Graham Neubig

In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

### 2. [Optimizing Agentic Workflows using Meta-tools](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22037v1)

Authors: Sami Abuzakuk, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Rishi Sharma, Rasmus Moorits Veski, Martijn de Vos

Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

### 3. [Drive-KD: Multi-Teacher Distillation for VLMs in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21288v1)

Authors: Weitong Lian, Zecong Tang, Haoran Li, Tianjian Gao, Yifei Wang, Zixu Wang, Lingyi Meng, Tengju Ru, Zhejun Cui, Yichen Zhu, Hangshuo Cao, Qi Kang, Tianxing Chen, Yusen Qin, Kaixuan Wang, Yu Zhang

Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

### 4. [SENDAI: A Hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21664v1)

Authors: Xingyue Zhang, Yuxuan Bao, Mars Liyao Gao, J. Nathan Kutz

Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.

### 5. [Hebbian Learning with Global Direction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21367v1)

Authors: Wenjia Hua, Kejie Zhao, Luziwei Leng, Ran Cheng, Yuxin Ma, Qinghai Guo

Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

### 6. [The Energy Impact of Domain Model Design in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21967v1)

Authors: Ilche Georgievski, Serhat Tekin, Marco Aiello

AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

### 7. [Improving Classifier-Free Guidance of Flow Matching via Manifold Projection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21892v1)

Authors: Jian-Feng Cai, Haixia Liu, Zhengyi Su, Chao Wang

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

### 8. [KnowBias: Mitigating Social Bias in LLMs via Know-Bias Neuron Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21864v1)

Authors: Jinhao Pan, Chahat Raj, Anjishnu Mukherjee, Sina Mansouri, Bowen Wei, Shloka Yada, Ziwei Zhu

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation. Data and code are available at https://github.com/JP-25/KnowBias.

### 9. [A Unified XAI-LLM Approach for EndotrachealSuctioning Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21802v1)

Authors: Hoang Khang Phan, Quang Vinh Dang, Noriyo Colley, Christina Garcia, Nhat Tan Le

Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

### 10. [KID: Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning for Knowledge-Grounded Harmful Meme Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21796v1)

Authors: Yaocong Li, Leihan Zhang, Le Zhang, Qiang Yan

Internet memes have become pervasive carriers of digital culture on social platforms. However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding. The code and data are available at https://github.com/PotatoDog1669/KID.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [PowerGenie: Analytically-Guided Evolutionary Discovery of Superior Reconfigurable Power Converters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21984v1)

Authors: Jian Gao, Yiwei Zou, Abhishek Pradhan, Wenhao Huang, Yumin Su, Kaiyuan Yang, Xuan Zhang

Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode. Code is available at https://github.com/xz-group/PowerGenie.

### 2. [ChipBench: A Next-Step Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Performance in AI-Aided Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21448v1)

Authors: Zhongkai Yu, Chenyang Zhou, Yichen Lin, Hejia Zhang, Haotian Ye, Junxia Cui, Zaifeng Pan, Jishen Zhao, Yufei Ding

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhongkaiyu/ChipBench.git.

### 3. [Heterogeneous Computing: The Key to Powering the Future of AI Agent Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22001v1)

Authors: Yiren Zhao, Junyi Liu

AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

### 4. [FireFly-P: FPGA-Accelerated Spiking Neural Network Plasticity for Robust Adaptive Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21222v1)

Authors: Tenglong Li, Jindong Li, Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Qian Zhang, Yi Zeng

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible learning mechanism through synaptic plasticity, enabling unsupervised adaptation without the computational overhead of backpropagation. To harness this capability for robotics, this paper presents FireFly-P, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator that implements a novel plasticity algorithm for real-time adaptive control. By leveraging on-chip plasticity, our architecture enhances the network's generalization, ensuring robust performance in dynamic and unstructured environments. The hardware design achieves an end-to-end latency of just 8~$μ$s for both inference and plasticity updates, enabling rapid adaptation to unseen scenarios. Implemented on a tiny Cmod A7-35T FPGA, FireFly-P consumes only 0.713~W and $\sim$10K~LUTs, making it ideal for power- and resource-constrained embedded robotic platforms. This work demonstrates that hardware-accelerated SNN plasticity is a viable path toward enabling adaptive, low-latency, and energy-efficient control systems.

### 5. [Frequency as Aperture: Enabling Embeddable Near-Field Sensing for 6G Wireless Radios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21584v1)

Authors: Pin-Han Ho, Limei Peng, Yiming Miao, Xu Fan, Kairan Liang, Haoran Mei, Wei Duan

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be natively supported by future 6G wireless radios, yet most mmWave sensing solutions still rely on dedicated radar hardware incompatible with cost and power constrained wireless nodes. This article introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a wireless-first sensing paradigm that repurposes inherent frequency agility into a virtual sensing aperture, enabling near-field perception with minimal RF front end complexity. Using a single RF chain and a frequency-scanning leaky-wave antenna, FaA achieves two dimensional spatial sensing by reusing the local oscillator (LO) frequency sweep already employed for wideband communication. From a wireless-system perspective, this shifts spatial sampling from the antenna domain to the frequency domain, embedding radar-grade spatial fingerprints directly into the communication RF chain. A case study shows that FaA provides fine angular and range discrimination with low power consumption and unit cost, demonstrating significantly higher architectural efficiency than conventional multi-channel MIMO based sensing under identical physical and spectral constraints. These results indicate that near-field sensing can be seamlessly integrated into frequency-agile wireless radios, enabling hardware-efficient, embeddable, and privacy-preserving ISAC nodes for smart homes, wearables, and industrial edge deployments.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [Strassen's support functionals coincide with the quantum functionals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21553v1)

Authors: Keiya Sakabe, Mahmut Levent Doğan, Michael Walter

Strassen's asymptotic spectrum offers a framework for analyzing the complexity of tensors. It has found applications in diverse areas, from computer science to additive combinatorics and quantum information. A long-standing open problem, dating back to 1991, asks whether Strassen's support functionals are universal spectral points, that is, points in the asymptotic spectrum of tensors.
  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by proving that the support functionals coincide with the quantum functionals - universal spectral points that are defined via entropy optimization on entanglement polytopes. We obtain this result as a special case of a general minimax formula for convex optimization on entanglement polytopes (and other moment polytopes) that has further applications to other tensor parameters, including the asymptotic slice rank. Our proof is based on a recent Fenchel-type duality theorem on Hadamard manifolds due to Hirai.

### 2. [Efficient Algorithms for Weakly-Interacting Quantum Spin Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21140v1)

Authors: Ryan L. Mann, Gabriel Waite

We establish efficient algorithms for weakly-interacting quantum spin systems at arbitrary temperature. In particular, we obtain a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the partition function and an efficient approximate sampling scheme for the thermal distribution over a classical spin space. Our approach is based on the cluster expansion method and a standard reduction from approximate sampling to approximate counting.

### 3. [On Approximate Computation of Critical Points](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21917v1)

Authors: Amir Ali Ahmadi, Georgina Hall

We show that computing even very coarse approximations of critical points is intractable for simple classes of nonconvex functions. More concretely, we prove that if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input a polynomial in $n$ variables of constant degree (as low as three) and outputs a point whose gradient has Euclidean norm at most $2^n$ whenever the polynomial has a critical point, then P=NP. The algorithm is permitted to return an arbitrary point when no critical point exists. We also prove hardness results for approximate computation of critical points under additional structural assumptions, including settings in which existence and uniqueness of a critical point are guaranteed, the function is lower bounded, and approximation is measured in terms of distance to a critical point. Overall, our results stand in contrast to the commonly-held belief that, in nonconvex optimization, approximate computation of critical points is a tractable task.

### 1. [SENDAI: A Hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21664v1)

Authors: Xingyue Zhang, Yuxuan Bao, Mars Liyao Gao, J. Nathan Kutz

Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites.

These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.

### 2. [Collective Noise Filtering in Complex Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21299v1)

Authors: Tingyu Zhao, István A. Kovács

Complex networks are powerful representations of complex systems across scales and domains, and the field is experiencing unprecedented growth in data availability. However, real-world network data often suffer from noise, biases, and missing data in the edge weights, which undermine the reliability of downstream network analyses. Standard noise filtering approaches, whether treating individual edges one-by-one or assuming a uniform global noise level, are suboptimal, because in reality both signal and noise can be heterogeneous and correlated across multiple edges. As a solution, we introduce the Network Wiener Filter, a principled method for collective edge-level noise filtering that leverages both network topology and noise characteristics, to reduce error in the observed edge weights and to infer missing edge weights. We demonstrate the broad practical efficacy of the Network Wiener Filter in two distinct settings, the genetic interaction network of the yeast S. cerevisiae and the Enron Corpus email network, noting compelling evidence of successful noise suppression in both applications. With the Network Wiener Filter, we advocate for a shift toward error-aware network science, one that embraces data imperfection as an inherent feature and learns to navigate it effectively.

### 3. [Synthetic Pattern Generation and Detection of Financial Activities using Graph Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21446v1)

Authors: Francesco Zola, Lucia Muñoz, Andrea Venturi, Amaia Gil

Illicit financial activities such as money laundering often manifest through recurrent topological patterns in transaction networks. Detecting these patterns automatically remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled real-world data and strict privacy constraints. To address this, we investigate whether Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) can effectively learn and distinguish topological patterns that mimic money laundering operations when trained on synthetic data. The analysis consists of two phases: (i) data generation, where synthetic samples are created for seven well-known illicit activity patterns using parametrized generators that preserve structural consistency while introducing realistic variability; and (ii) model training and validation, where separate GAEs are trained on each pattern without explicit labels, relying solely on reconstruction error as an indicator of learned structure. We compare three GAE implementations based on three distinct convolutional layers: Graph Convolutional (GAE-GCN), GraphSAGE (GAE-SAGE), and Graph Attention Network (GAE-GAT). Experimental results show that GAE-GCN achieves the most consistent reconstruction performance across patterns, while GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT exhibit competitive results only in few specific patterns. These findings suggest that graph-based representation learning on synthetic data provides a viable path toward developing AI-driven tools for detecting illicit behaviors, overcoming the limitations of financial datasets.

### 4. [The Patient is not a Moving Document: A World Model Training Paradigm for Longitudinal EHR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22128v1)

Authors: Irsyad Adam, Zekai Chen, David Laprade, Shaun Porwal, David Laub, Erik Reinertsen, Arda Pekis, Kevin Brown

Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/standardmodelbio/SMB-v1-1.7B-Structure.

### Computation and Language

### 1. [Mil-SCORE: Benchmarking Long-Context Geospatial Reasoning and Planning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21826v1)

Authors: Aadi Palnitkar, Mingyang Mao, Nicholas Waytowich, Vinicius G. Goecks, Tinoosh Mohsenin, Xiaomin Lin

As large language models (LLMs) are applied to increasingly longer and more complex tasks, there is a growing need for realistic long-context benchmarks that require selective reading and integration of heterogeneous, multi-modal information sources. This need is especially acute for geospatial planning problems, such as those found in planning for large-scale military operations, which demand fast and accurate reasoning over maps, orders, intelligence reports, and other distributed data. To address this gap, we present MilSCORE (Military Scenario Contextual Reasoning), to our knowledge the first scenario-level dataset of expert-authored, multi-hop questions grounded in a complex, simulated military planning scenario used for training. MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models. Our findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning, and positioning MilSCORE as a challenging testbed for future work.

### 2. [KID: Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning for Knowledge-Grounded Harmful Meme Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21796v1)

### 3. [GeoNorm: Unify Pre-Norm and Post-Norm with Geodesic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22095v1)

Authors: Chuanyang Zheng, Jiankai Sun, Yihang Gao, Chi Wang, Yuehao Wang, Jing Xiong, Liliang Ren, Bo Peng, Qingmei Wang, Xiaoran Shang, Mac Schwager, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Xiaodong Liu

The placement of normalization layers, specifically Pre-Norm and Post-Norm, remains an open question in Transformer architecture design. In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold. Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods in Transformer models. Crucially, GeoNorm can be seamlessly integrated into standard Transformer architectures, achieving performance improvements with negligible additional computational cost.

### 4. [$G^2$-Reader: Dual Evolving Graphs for Multimodal Document QA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22055v1)

Authors: Yaxin Du, Junru Song, Yifan Zhou, Cheng Wang, Jiahao Gu, Zimeng Chen, Menglan Chen, Wen Yao, Yang Yang, Ying Wen, Siheng Chen

Retrieval-augmented generation is a practical paradigm for question answering over long documents, but it remains brittle for multimodal reading where text, tables, and figures are interleaved across many pages. First, flat chunking breaks document-native structure and cross-modal alignment, yielding semantic fragments that are hard to interpret in isolation. Second, even iterative retrieval can fail in long contexts by looping on partial evidence or drifting into irrelevant sections as noise accumulates, since each step is guided only by the current snippet without a persistent global search state. We introduce $G^2$-Reader, a dual-graph system, to address both issues. It evolves a Content Graph to preserve document-native structure and cross-modal semantics, and maintains a Planning Graph, an agentic directed acyclic graph of sub-questions, to track intermediate findings and guide stepwise navigation for evidence completion. On VisDoMBench across five multimodal domains, $G^2$-Reader with Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct reaches 66.21\% average accuracy, outperforming strong baselines and a standalone GPT-5 (53.08\%).

### 5. [On the Paradoxical Interference between Instruction-Following and Task Solving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22047v1)

Authors: Yunjia Qi, Hao Peng, Xintong Shi, Amy Xin, Xiaozhi Wang, Bin Xu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li

Instruction following aims to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent by specifying explicit constraints on how tasks should be performed. However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones. Finally, we use SUSTAINSCORE to conduct an initial investigation into how distinct post-training paradigms affect the interference, presenting empirical observations on current alignment strategies. We will release our code and data to facilitate further research

### 6. [A Separable Architecture for Continuous Token Representation in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22040v1)

Authors: Reza T. Batley, Sourav Saha

Transformer scaling law analyses typically treat parameters as interchangeable; an abstraction that accurately predicts loss-compute relationships. Yet, in sub-billion-parameter small language models (SLMs), embedding matrices dominate the parameter budget. This work argues that this allocation is as suboptimal as it is counterintuitive. Leviathan is an architecture with a continuous embedding generator to replace the discrete lookup tables of canonical models. Evaluating on the Pile dataset under isoparametric settings, Leviathan consistently outperforms a standard, LLaMA-style architecture. By means of an empirical power-law fit, Leviathan exhibits a markedly superior effective parameter capacity. Across the regime studied, Leviathan behaves as a dense model with $1.47$ to $2.11 \times$ more parameters.

### 7. [Thinking Out of Order: When Output Order Stops Reflecting Reasoning Order in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22035v1)

Authors: Longxuan Yu, Yu Fu, Shaorong Zhang, Hui Liu, Mukund Varma T, Greg Ver Steeg, Yue Dong

Autoregressive (AR) language models enforce a fixed left-to-right generation order, creating a fundamental limitation when the required output structure conflicts with natural reasoning (e.g., producing answers before explanations due to presentation or schema constraints). In such cases, AR models must commit to answers before generating intermediate reasoning, and this rigid constraint forces premature commitment. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs), which iteratively refine all tokens in parallel, offer a way to decouple computation order from output structure. We validate this capability on GSM8K, Math500, and ReasonOrderQA, a benchmark we introduce with controlled difficulty and order-level evaluation. When prompts request answers before reasoning, AR models exhibit large accuracy gaps compared to standard chain-of-thought ordering (up to 67% relative drop), while MDLMs remain stable ($\leq$14% relative drop), a property we term "order robustness". Using ReasonOrderQA, we present evidence that MDLMs achieve order robustness by stabilizing simpler tokens (e.g., reasoning steps) earlier in the diffusion process than complex ones (e.g., final answers), enabling reasoning tokens to stabilize before answer commitment. Finally, we identify failure conditions where this advantage weakens, outlining the limits required for order robustness.

### 8. [OVD: On-policy Verbal Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21968v1)

Authors: Jing Xiong, Hui Shen, Shansan Gong, Yuxin Cheng, Jianghan Shen, Chaofan Tao, Haochen Tan, Haoli Bai, Lifeng Shang, Ngai Wong

Knowledge distillation offers a promising path to transfer reasoning capabilities from large teacher models to efficient student models; however, existing token-level on-policy distillation methods require token-level alignment between the student and teacher models, which restricts the student model's exploration ability, prevent effective use of interactive environment feedback, and suffer from severe memory bottlenecks in reinforcement learning. We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

### 9. [From Generative Modeling to Clinical Classification: A GPT-Based Architecture for EHR Notes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21955v1)

Authors: Fariba Afrin Irany

The increasing availability of unstructured clinical narratives in electronic health records (EHRs) has created new opportunities for automated disease characterization, cohort identification, and clinical decision support. However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models.
  This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language.
  The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings.
  Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity.

### 10. [MAR: Efficient Large Language Models via Module-aware Architecture Refinement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21503v1)

Authors: Junhong Cai, Guiqin Wang, Kejie Zhao, Jianxiong Tang, Xiang Wang, Luziwei Leng, Ran Cheng, Yuxin Ma, Qinghai Guo

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse domains but suffer from high energy costs due to quadratic attention and dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) operations. To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR effectively restores the performance of its dense counterpart under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption. Furthermore, it outperforms efficient models of comparable or even larger scale, underscoring its potential for building efficient and practical LLMs.

### 1. [Incremental Fingerprinting in an Open World](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21680v1)

Authors: Loes Kruger, Paul Kobialka, Andrea Pferscher, Einar Broch Johnsen, Sebastian Junges, Jurriaan Rot

Network protocol fingerprinting is used to identify a protocol implementation by analyzing its input-output behavior. Traditionally, fingerprinting operates under a closed-world assumption, where models of all implementations are assumed to be available. However, this assumption is unrealistic in practice. When this assumption does not hold, fingerprinting results in numerous misclassifications without indicating that a model for an implementation is missing. Therefore, we introduce an open-world variant of the fingerprinting problem, where not all models are known in advance. We propose an incremental fingerprinting approach to solve the problem by combining active automata learning with closed-world fingerprinting. Our approach quickly determines whether the implementation under consideration matches an available model using fingerprinting and conformance checking. If no match is found, it learns a new model by exploiting the structure of available models. We prove the correctness of our approach and improvements in asymptotic complexity compared to naive baselines. Moreover, experimental results on a variety of protocols demonstrate a significant reduction in misclassifications and interactions with these black-boxes.

### 2. [Sampling-Free Privacy Accounting for Matrix Mechanisms under Random Allocation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21636v1)

Authors: Jan Schuchardt, Nikita Kalinin

We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

### 3. [Hardware-Triggered Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21902v1)

Authors: Jonas Möller, Erik Imgrund, Thorsten Eisenhofer, Konrad Rieck

Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat.

### 4. [WADBERT: Dual-channel Web Attack Detection Based on BERT Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21893v1)

Authors: Kangqiang Luo, Yi Xie, Shiqian Zhao, Jing Pan

Web attack detection is the first line of defense for securing web applications, designed to preemptively identify malicious activities. Deep learning-based approaches are increasingly popular for their advantages: automatically learning complex patterns and extracting semantic features from HTTP requests to achieve superior detection performance. However, existing methods are less effective in embedding irregular HTTP requests, even failing to model unordered parameters and achieve attack traceability. In this paper, we propose an effective web attack detection model, named WADBERT. It achieves high detection accuracy while enabling the precise identification of malicious parameters. To this end, we first employ Hybrid Granularity Embedding (HGE) to generate fine-grained embeddings for URL and payload parameters. Then, URLBERT and SecBERT are respectively utilized to extract their semantic features. Further, parameter-level features (extracted by SecBERT) are fused through a multi-head attention mechanism, resulting in a comprehensive payload feature. Finally, by feeding the concatenated URL and payload features into a linear classifier, a final detection result is obtained. The experimental results on CSIC2010 and SR-BH2020 datasets validate the efficacy of WADBERT, which respectively achieves F1-scores of 99.63% and 99.50%, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### 5. [SecIC3: Customizing IC3 for Hardware Security Verification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21353v1)

Authors: Qinhan Tan, Akash Gaonkar, Yu-Wei Fan, Aarti Gupta, Sharad Malik

Recent years have seen significant advances in using formal verification to check hardware security properties. Of particular practical interest are checking confidentiality and integrity of secrets, by checking that there is no information flow between the secrets and observable outputs. A standard method for checking information flow is to translate the corresponding non-interference hyperproperty into a safety property on a self-composition of the design, which has two copies of the design composed together. Although prior efforts have aimed to reduce the size of the self-composed design, there are no state-of-the-art model checkers that exploit their special structure for hardware security verification. In this paper, we propose SecIC3, a hardware model checking algorithm based on IC3 that is customized to exploit this self-composition structure. SecIC3 utilizes this structure in two complementary techniques: symmetric state exploration and adding equivalence predicates. We implement SecIC3 on top of two open-source IC3 implementations and evaluate it on a non-interference checking benchmark consisting of 10 designs. The experiment results show that SecIC3 significantly reduces the time for finding security proofs, with up to 49.3x proof speedup compared to baseline implementations.

Authors: Gayathri Subramanian, Girinath P, Nitya Ranganathan, Kamakoti Veezhinathan, Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan

Modern microprocessors depend on speculative execution, creating vulnerabilities that enable transient execution attacks. Prior defenses target speculative data leakage but overlook false dependencies from partial address aliasing, where repeated squash and reissue events increase the load-store latency, which is exploited by the SPOILER attack. We present SPOILER-GUARD, a hardware defense that obfuscates speculative dependency resolution by dynamically randomizing the physical address bits used for load-store comparisons and tagging store entries to prevent latency-amplifying misspeculations. Implemented in gem5 and evaluated with SPEC 2017, SPOILER-GUARD reduces misspeculation to 0.0004 percent and improves integer and floating-point performance by 2.12 and 2.87 percent. HDL synthesis with Synopsys Design Compiler at 14 nm node demonstrates minimal overheads - 69 ps latency in critical path, 0.064 square millimeter in area, and 5.863 mW in power.

### 7. [Beyond the Finite Variant Property: Extending Symbolic Diffie-Hellman Group Models (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21910v1)

Authors: Sofia Giampietro, Ralf Sasse, David Basin

Diffie-Hellman groups are commonly used in cryptographic protocols. While most state-of-the-art, symbolic protocol verifiers support them to some degree, they do not support all mathematical operations possible in these groups. In particular, they lack support for exponent addition, as these tools reason about terms using unification, which is undecidable in the theory describing all Diffie-Hellman operators. In this paper we approximate such a theory and propose a semi-decision procedure to determine whether a protocol, which may use all operations in such groups, satisfies user-defined properties. We implement this approach by extending the Tamarin prover to support the full Diffie-Hellman theory, including group element multiplication and hence addition of exponents. This is the first time a state-of-the-art tool can model and reason about such protocols. We illustrate our approach's effectiveness with different case studies: ElGamal encryption and MQV. Using Tamarin, we prove security properties of ElGamal, and we rediscover known attacks on MQV.

### 8. [Adaptive and Robust Cost-Aware Proof of Quality for Decentralized LLM Inference Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21189v1)

Authors: Arther Tian, Alex Ding, Frank Chen, Simon Wu, Aaron Chan

Decentralized large language model inference networks require lightweight mechanisms to reward high quality outputs under heterogeneous latency and cost. Proof of Quality provides scalable verification by sampling evaluator nodes that score candidate outputs, then aggregating their scores into a consensus signal that determines rewards. However, evaluator heterogeneity and malicious score manipulation can distort consensus and inflate payouts, which weakens incentive alignment in open participation settings.
  This paper extends a cost-aware Proof of Quality mechanism by adding adversary-resilient consensus formation. We study robust aggregation rules, including median and trimmed mean, and an adaptive trust-weighted consensus that updates evaluator weights from deviation signals. Using question answering and summarization workloads with a ground truth proxy for offline analysis, we quantify evaluator reliability and show strong variance across evaluators, including task-dependent misalignment that can invert correlations. We then evaluate robustness under four adversarial strategies, including noise injection, boosting, sabotage, and intermittent manipulation, across a sweep of malicious ratios and evaluator sample sizes. Our results show that robust aggregation improves consensus alignment with the ground truth proxy and reduces sensitivity to noisy and strategic attacks compared with simple averaging. We further characterize the operational trade-off introduced by evaluator sampling, where larger evaluator sets reduce evaluator rewards and increase payoff variance while inference rewards remain relatively stable in our configuration. These findings motivate robust consensus as a default component for cost-aware Proof of Quality and provide practical guidance for selecting evaluator sampling parameters under adversarial risk and resource constraints.

Authors: Andrew Savchenko

We explore how command stack protection requirements outlined in NASA-STD-1006A can be satisfied within the context of emergency space telemetry. Proposed implementation of lightweight authenticated encryption offers strong security without sacrificing performance in resource-constrained environments. It produces fixed-length messages, maintaining compatibility with the underlying data transport protocols. By focusing on predictable properties and robust authentication, we create a scheme that protects the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of telemetry data in emergency communications while balancing security requirements with the operational constraints.

### 10. [On the Adversarial Robustness of Large Vision-Language Models under Visual Token Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21531v1)

Authors: Xinwei Zhang, Hangcheng Liu, Li Bai, Hao Wang, Qingqing Ye, Tianwei Zhang, Haibo Hu

Visual token compression is widely used to accelerate large vision-language models (LVLMs) by pruning or merging visual tokens, yet its adversarial robustness remains unexplored. We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence. Across diverse representative plug-and-play compression mechanisms and datasets, our results show that CAGE consistently achieves lower robust accuracy than the baseline. This work highlights that robustness assessments ignoring compression can be overly optimistic, calling for compression-aware security evaluation and defenses for efficient LVLMs.

### 1. [InspecSafe-V1: A Multimodal Benchmark for Safety Assessment in Industrial Inspection Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21173v1)

Authors: Zeyi Liu, Shuang Liu, Jihai Min, Zhaoheng Zhang, Jun Cen, Pengyu Han, Songqiao Hu, Zihan Meng, Xiao He, Donghua Zhou

With the rapid development of industrial intelligence and unmanned inspection, reliable perception and safety assessment for AI systems in complex and dynamic industrial sites has become a key bottleneck for deploying predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection. Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances. For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments.

### 2. [Bidirectional Cross-Perception for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21159v1)

Authors: Jianzheng Wang, Huan Ni

High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

Authors: Songhan Jiang, Fengchun Liu, Ziyue Wang, Linghan Cai, Yongbing Zhang

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/cyclexfy/PathReasoner-R1.

Authors: Zhuoqin Yang, Jiansong Zhang, Xiaoling Luo, Xu Wu, Zheng Lu, Linlin Shen

Attention mechanisms have become a key module in modern vision backbones due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

Authors: Miao Zhang, Guanzhen Wu, Hao Fang, Yifei Zhu, Fangxin Wang, Ruixiao Zhang, Jiangchuan Liu

Edge-assisted mobile video analytics (MVA) applications are increasingly shifting from using vision models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to those built on vision transformers (ViTs) to leverage their superior global context modeling and generalization capabilities. However, deploying these advanced models in latency-critical MVA scenarios presents significant challenges. Unlike traditional CNN-based offloading paradigms where network transmission is the primary bottleneck, ViT-based systems are constrained by substantial inference delays, particularly for dense prediction tasks where the need for high-resolution inputs exacerbates the inherent quadratic computational complexity of ViTs. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic mixed-resolution inference strategy tailored for ViT-backboned dense prediction models, enabling flexible runtime trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Building on this, we introduce ViTMAlis, a ViT-native device-to-edge offloading framework that dynamically adapts to network conditions and video content to jointly reduce transmission and inference delays. We implement a fully functional prototype of ViTMAlis on commodity mobile and edge devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-centric, content-aware, and latency-adaptive baselines, ViTMAlis significantly reduces end-to-end offloading latency while improving user-perceived rendering accuracy, providing a practical foundation for next-generation mobile intelligence.

Authors: Yuxiang Huang, Mingye Li, Xu Han, Chaojun Xiao, Weilin Zhao, Ao Sun, Ziqi Yuan, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Zhiyuan Liu

The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

### 7. [Improving Classifier-Free Guidance of Flow Matching via Manifold Projection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21892v1)

Authors: Jian-Feng Cai, Haixia Liu, Zhengyi Su, Chao Wang

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

Authors: Ahmed Y. Radwan, Christos Emmanouilidis, Hina Tabassum, Deval Pandya, Shaina Raza

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are a major focus of recent AI research. However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding. We release SONIC-O1 for reproducibility and research: Project page: https://vectorinstitute.github.io/sonic-o1/ Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/vector-institute/sonic-o1 Github: https://github.com/vectorinstitute/sonic-o1 Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/vector-institute/sonic-o1-leaderboard

### 9. [BLO-Inst: Bi-Level Optimization Based Alignment of YOLO and SAM for Robust Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22061v1)

Authors: Li Zhang, Pengtao Xie

The Segment Anything Model has revolutionized image segmentation with its zero-shot capabilities, yet its reliance on manual prompts hinders fully automated deployment. While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.

Although diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement methods have achieved great success, applying them to video restoration or enhancement will lead to severe temporal flickering. In this paper, we propose the first framework that utilizes the rapidly-developed video diffusion model to assist the image-based method in maintaining more temporal consistency for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement. We propose homologous latents fusion, heterogenous latents fusion, and a COT-based fusion ratio strategy to utilize both homologous and heterogenous text-to-video diffusion models to complement the image method. Moreover, we propose temporal-strengthening post-processing to utilize the image-to-video diffusion model to further improve temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and can be applied to any diffusion-based image restoration and enhancement methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

### 1. [Turning Language Model Training from Black Box into a Sandbox](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21631v1)

Authors: Nicolas Pope, Matti Tedre

Most classroom engagements with generative AI focus on prompting pre-trained models, leaving the role of training data and model mechanics opaque. We developed a browser-based tool that allows students to train a small transformer language model entirely on their own device, making the training process visible. In a CS1 course, 162 students completed pre- and post-test explanations of why language models sometimes produce incorrect or strange output. After a brief hands-on training activity, students' explanations shifted significantly from anthropomorphic and misconceived accounts toward data- and model-based reasoning. The results suggest that enabling learners to directly observe training can support conceptual understanding of the data-driven nature of language models and model training, even within a short intervention. For K-12 AI literacy and AI education research, the study findings suggest that enabling students to train - and not only prompt - language models can shift how they think about AI.

Authors: Bowen Zhou, Marc-André Fiedler, Ayoub Al-Hamadi

Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that severely impairs daily functioning and quality of life. While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Experiments on two in-the-wild benchmark datasets, LMVD and D-Vlog, demonstrate that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Authors: Chuancheng Shi, Shangze Li, Wenjun Lu, Wenhua Wu, Cong Wang, Zifeng Cheng, Fei Shen, Tat-Seng Chua

Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.

### 4. [Test-Time Compute Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21839v1)

Authors: Ander Artola Velasco, Dimitrios Rontogiannis, Stratis Tsirtsis, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez

Test-time compute has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, this strategy has in turn increased how much users pay cloud-based providers offering LLM-as-a-service, since providers charge users for the amount of test-time compute they use to generate an output. In our work, we show that the market of LLM-as-a-service is socially inefficient: providers have a financial incentive to increase the amount of test-time compute, even if this increase contributes little to the quality of the outputs. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a reverse second-price auction mechanism where providers bid their offered price and (expected) quality for the opportunity to serve a user, and users pay proportionally to the marginal value generated by the winning provider relative to the second-highest bidder. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with multiple instruct models from the $\texttt{Llama}$ and $\texttt{Qwen}$ families, as well as reasoning models distilled from $\texttt{DeepSeek-R1}$, on math and science benchmark datasets.

### 5. [From Particles to Agents: Hallucination as a Metric for Cognitive Friction in Spatial Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21977v1)

Authors: Javier Argota Sánchez-Vaquerizo, Luis Borunda Monsivais

Traditional architectural simulations (e.g. Computational Fluid Dynamics, evacuation, structural analysis) model elements as deterministic physics-based "particles" rather than cognitive "agents". To bridge this, we introduce \textbf{Agentic Environmental Simulations}, where Large Multimodal generative models actively predict the next state of spatial environments based on semantic expectation. Drawing on examples from accessibility-oriented AR pipelines and multimodal digital twins, we propose a shift from chronological time-steps to Episodic Spatial Reasoning, where simulations advance through meaningful, surprisal-triggered events. Within this framework we posit AI hallucinations as diagnostic tools. By formalizing the \textbf{Cognitive Friction} ($C_f$) it is possible to reveal "Phantom Affordances", i.e. semiotic ambiguities in built space. Finally, we challenge current HCI paradigms by treating environments as dynamic cognitive partners and propose a human-centered framework of cognitive orchestration for designing AI-driven simulations that preserve autonomy, affective clarity, and cognitive integrity.

### 6. [Industrialized Deception: The Collateral Effects of LLM-Generated Misinformation on Digital Ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21963v1)

Authors: Alexander Loth, Martin Kappes, Marc-Oliver Pahl

Generative AI and misinformation research has evolved since our 2024 survey. This paper presents an updated perspective, transitioning from literature review to practical countermeasures. We report on changes in the threat landscape, including improved AI-generated content through Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal systems. Central to this work are our practical contributions: JudgeGPT, a platform for evaluating human perception of AI-generated news, and RogueGPT, a controlled stimulus generation engine for research. Together, these tools form an experimental pipeline for studying how humans perceive and detect AI-generated misinformation. Our findings show that detection capabilities have improved, but the competition between generation and detection continues. We discuss mitigation strategies including LLM-based detection, inoculation approaches, and the dual-use nature of generative AI. This work contributes to research addressing the adverse impacts of AI on information quality.

### 7. [Investigating Associational Biases in Inter-Model Communication of Large Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22093v1)

Authors: Fethiye Irmak Dogan, Yuval Weiss, Kajal Patel, Jiaee Cheong, Hatice Gunes

Social bias in generative AI can manifest not only as performance disparities but also as associational bias, whereby models learn and reproduce stereotypical associations between concepts and demographic groups, even in the absence of explicit demographic information (e.g., associating doctors with men). These associations can persist, propagate, and potentially amplify across repeated exchanges in inter-model communication pipelines, where one generative model's output becomes another's input. This is especially salient for human-centred perception tasks, such as human activity recognition and affect prediction, where inferences about behaviour and internal states can lead to errors or stereotypical associations that propagate into unequal treatment. In this work, focusing on human activity and affective expression, we study how such associations evolve within an inter-model communication pipeline that alternates between image generation and image description. Using the RAF-DB and PHASE datasets, we quantify demographic distribution drift induced by model-to-model information exchange and assess whether these drifts are systematic using an explainability pipeline. Our results reveal demographic drifts toward younger representations for both actions and emotions, as well as toward more female-presenting representations, primarily for emotions. We further find evidence that some predictions are supported by spurious visual regions (e.g., background or hair) rather than concept-relevant cues (e.g., body or face). We also examine whether these demographic drifts translate into measurable differences in downstream behaviour, i.e., while predicting activity and emotion labels. Finally, we outline mitigation strategies spanning data-centric, training and deployment interventions, and emphasise the need for careful safeguards when deploying interconnected models in human-centred AI systems.

### 8. [Small models, big threats: Characterizing safety challenges from low-compute AI models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21365v1)

Authors: Prateek Puri

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are revolutionizing fields such as medicine, drug discovery, and materials science; however, many technologists and policymakers are also concerned about the technology's risks. To date, most concrete policies around AI governance have focused on managing AI risk by considering the amount of compute required to operate or build a given AI system. However, low-compute AI systems are becoming increasingly more performant - and more dangerous. Driven by agentic workflows, parameter quantization, and other model compression techniques, capabilities once only achievable on frontier-level systems have diffused into low-resource models deployable on consumer devices. In this report, we profile this trend by downloading historical benchmark performance data for over 5,000 large language models (LLMs) hosted on HuggingFace, noting the model size needed to achieve competitive LLM benchmarks has decreased by more than 10X over the past year. We then simulate the computational resources needed for an actor to launch a series of digital societal harm campaigns - such as disinformation botnets, sexual extortion schemes, voice-cloning fraud, and others - using low-compute open-source models and find nearly all studied campaigns can easily be executed on consumer-grade hardware. This position paper argues that protection measures for high-compute models leave serious security holes for their low-compute counterparts, meaning it is urgent both policymakers and technologists make greater efforts to understand and address this emerging class of threats.

### 9. [Trustworthy Intelligent Education: A Systematic Perspective on Progress, Challenges, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21837v1)

Authors: Xiaoshan Yu, Shangshang Yang, Ziwen Wang, Haiping Ma, Xingyi Zhang

In recent years, trustworthiness has garnered increasing attention and exploration in the field of intelligent education, due to the inherent sensitivity of educational scenarios, such as involving minors and vulnerable groups, highly personalized learning data, and high-stakes educational outcomes. However, existing research either focuses on task-specific trustworthy methods without a holistic view of trustworthy intelligent education, or provides survey-level discussions that remain high-level and fragmented, lacking a clear and systematic categorization. To address these limitations, in this paper, we present a systematic and structured review of trustworthy intelligent education. Specifically, We first organize intelligent education into five representative task categories: learner ability assessment, learning resource recommendation, learning analytics, educational content understanding, and instructional assistance. Building on this task landscape, we review existing studies from five trustworthiness perspectives, including safety and privacy, robustness, fairness, explainability, and sustainability, and summarize and categorize the research methodologies and solution strategies therein. Finally, we summarize key challenges and discuss future research directions. This survey aims to provide a coherent reference framework and facilitate a clearer understanding of trustworthiness in intelligent education.

### 10. [Moral Outrage Shapes Commitments Beyond Attention: Multimodal Moral Emotions on YouTube in Korea and the US](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21815v1)

Authors: Seongchan Park, Jaehong Kim, Hyeonseung Kim, Heejin Bin, Sue Moon, Wonjae Lee

Understanding how media rhetoric shapes audience engagement is crucial in the attention economy. This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers.

### 1. [Ira: Efficient Transaction Replay for Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21286v1)

Authors: Adithya Bhat, Harshal Bhadreshkumar Shah, Mohsen Minaei

In primary-backup replication, consensus latency is bounded by the time for backup nodes to replay (re-execute) transactions proposed by the primary. In this work, we present Ira, a framework to accelerate backup replay by transmitting compact \emph{hints} alongside transaction batches. Our key insight is that the primary, having already executed transactions, possesses knowledge of future access patterns which is exactly the information needed for optimal replay.
  We use Ethereum for our case study and present a concrete protocol, Ira-L, within our framework to improve cache management of Ethereum block execution. The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay.
  We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\sim5\%$ of block payload). We observe that the sequential hint generation and block execution imposes a $28.6\%$ wall-time overhead on the primary, though the direct cost from hints is $10.9\%$ of execution time; all of which can be pipelined and parallelized in production deployments. On the backup side, we observe that Ira-L achieves a median per-block speedup of $25\times$ over baseline reth. With $16$ prefetch threads, aggregate replay time drops from $6.5$ hours to $16$ minutes ($23.6\times$ wall-time speedup).

Authors: Geonhee Jo, Mingu Kang, Kangmin Lee, Minho Lee, Pascal Bauer, Sang-Ki Ko

Event stream data is a critical resource for fine-grained analysis across various domains, including financial transactions, system operations, and sports. In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.

Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances multihop question answering by organizing corpora into knowledge graphs and routing evidence through relational structure. However, practical deployments face two persistent bottlenecks: (i) mixed-difficulty workloads where one-size-fits-all retrieval either wastes cost on easy queries or fails on hard multihop cases, and (ii) extraction loss, where graph abstraction omits fine-grained qualifiers that remain only in source text. We present A2RAG, an adaptive-and-agentic GraphRAG framework for cost-aware and reliable reasoning. A2RAG couples an adaptive controller that verifies evidence sufficiency and triggers targeted refinement only when necessary, with an agentic retriever that progressively escalates retrieval effort and maps graph signals back to provenance text to remain robust under extraction loss and incomplete graphs. Experiments on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that A2RAG achieves +9.9/+11.8 absolute gains in Recall@2, while cutting token consumption and end-to-end latency by about 50% relative to iterative multihop baselines.

Arabic is a linguistically and culturally rich language with a vast vocabulary that spans scientific, religious, and literary domains. Yet, large-scale lexical datasets linking Arabic words to precise definitions remain limited. We present MURAD (Multi-domain Unified Reverse Arabic Dictionary), an open lexical dataset with 96,243 word-definition pairs. The data come from trusted reference works and educational sources. Extraction used a hybrid pipeline integrating direct text parsing, optical character recognition, and automated reconstruction. This ensures accuracy and clarity. Each record aligns a target word with its standardized Arabic definition and metadata that identifies the source domain. The dataset covers terms from linguistics, Islamic studies, mathematics, physics, psychology, and engineering. It supports computational linguistics and lexicographic research. Applications include reverse dictionary modeling, semantic retrieval, and educational tools. By releasing this resource, we aim to advance Arabic natural language processing and promote reproducible research on Arabic lexical semantics.

### 5. [Self-Adaptive Probabilistic Skyline Query Processing in Distributed Edge Computing via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21855v1)

Authors: Chuan-Chi Lai

In the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), the exponential growth of sensor-generated data at the network edge renders efficient Probabilistic Skyline Query (PSKY) processing a critical challenge. Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\% in communication overhead and 40\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.

Authors: Xinwei Qiang, Hongmin Chen, Shixuan Sun, Jingwen Leng, Xin Liu, Minyi Guo

Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

Authors: Jae-Won Chung, Ruofan Wu, Jeff J. Ma, Mosharaf Chowdhury

Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

Missing data is a prevalent issue in many applications, including large medical registries such as the Swedish Healthcare Quality Registries, potentially leading to biased or inefficient analyses if not handled properly. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a popular and versatile method for handling multivariate missing data but traditional implementations face significant challenges when applied to big data sets due to computational time and memory limitations.
  To address this, the bigMICE package was developed, adapting the MICE framework to big data using Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML. Our implementation allows for controlling the maximum memory usage during the execution, enabling processing of very large data sets on a hardware with a limited memory, such as ordinary laptops.
  The developed package was tested on a large Swedish medical registry to measure memory usage, runtime and dependence of the imputation quality on sample size and on missingness proportion in the data. In conclusion, our method is generally more memory efficient and faster on large data sets compared to a commonly used MICE implementation. We also demonstrate that working with very large datasets can result in high quality imputations even when a variable has a large proportion of missing data. This paper also provides guidelines and recommendations on how to install and use our open source package.

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.

### 6. [Heterogeneous Computing: The Key to Powering the Future of AI Agent Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22001v1)

Authors: Yiren Zhao, Junyi Liu

AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

Authors: Shuo Liu, Tianle Chen, Ryan Amiri, Christopher Amato

Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

Authors: Zaifeng Pan, Yipeng Shen, Zhengding Hu, Zhuang Wang, Aninda Manocha, Zheng Wang, Zhongkai Yu, Yue Guan, Yufei Ding

LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

Authors: Zeyu He, Yuchang Zhang, Yuanzhen Zhou, Miao Tao, Hengjie Li, Yang Tian, Jia Zeng, Tai Wang, Wenzhe Cai, Yilun Chen, Ning Gao, Jiangmiao Pang

Scaling data volume and diversity is critical for generalizing embodied intelligence. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific. This isolation leads to significant engineering inefficiency and system instability, failing to support the sustained, high-throughput data generation required for foundation model training. To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis.

### 10. [Maxwait: A Generalized Mechanism for Distributed Time-Sensitive Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21146v1)

Authors: Francesco Paladino, Shulu Li, Edward A. Lee

Distributed time-sensitive systems must balance timing requirements (availability) and consistency in the presence of communication delays and synchronization uncertainty. This paper presents maxwait, a simple coordination mechanism with surprising generality that makes these tradeoffs explicit and configurable. We demonstrate that this mechanism subsumes classical distributed system methods such as PTIDES, Chandy-and-Misra with or without null messages, Jefferson's Time-Warp, and Lamport's time-based fault detection, while enabling real-time behavior in distributed cyber-physical applications. The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework. Implemented as an extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, maxwait enforces logical-time consistency when communication latencies are bounded and provides structured fault handling when bounds are violated.

Authors: Daniel Torres-Salinas, Wenceslao Arroyo-Machado

The present comparative study examines the three main multidisciplinary bibliographic databases, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and OpenAlex, with the aim of providing up-to-date evidence on coverage, metadata quality, and functional features to help inform strategic decisions in research assessment. The report is structured into two complementary methodological sections. First, it presents a systematic review of recent scholarly literature that investigates record volume, open-access coverage, linguistic diversity, reference coverage, and metadata quality; this is followed by an original bibliometric analysis of the 2015-2024 period that explores longitudinal distribution, document types, thematic profiles, linguistic differences, and overlap between databases. The text concludes with a ten-point executive summary and five recommendations.

Authors: Huiling Xie, Zitan Chen

We study deletion-correcting codes for an adversarial nanopore channel in which at most $t$ deletions may occur. We propose an explicit construction of $q$-ary codes of length $n$ for this channel with $2t\log_q n+Θ(\log\log n)$ redundant symbols. We also show that the optimal redundancy is between $t\log_q n+Ω(1)$ and $2t\log_q n-\log_q\log_2 n+O(1)$, so our explicit construction matches the existential upper bound to first order. In contrast, for the classical adversarial $q$-ary deletion channel, the smallest redundancy achieved by known explicit constructions that correct up to $t$ deletions is $4t(1+ε)\log_q n+o(\log n)$.

### 1. [Adaptively Robust Resettable Streaming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21989v1)

Authors: Edith Cohen, Elena Gribelyuk, Jelani Nelson, Uri Stemmer

We study algorithms in the resettable streaming model, where the value of each key can either be increased or reset to zero. The model is suitable for applications such as active resource monitoring with support for deletions and machine unlearning. We show that all existing sketches for this model are vulnerable to adaptive adversarial attacks that apply even when the sketch size is polynomial in the length of the stream.
  To overcome these vulnerabilities, we present the first adaptively robust sketches for resettable streams that maintain polylogarithmic space complexity in the stream length. Our framework supports (sub) linear statistics including $L_p$ moments for $p\in[0,1]$ (in particular, Cardinality and Sum) and Bernstein statistics. We bypass strong impossibility results known for linear and composable sketches by designing dedicated streaming sketches robustified via Differential Privacy. Unlike standard robustification techniques, which provide limited benefits in this setting and still require polynomial space in the stream length, we leverage the Binary Tree Mechanism for continual observation to protect the sketch's internal randomness. This enables accurate prefix-max error guarantees with polylogarithmic space.

Authors: Léo Colisson Palais, Jean-Guillaume Dumas, Alexis Galan, Bruno Grenet, Aude Maignan

We consider stamps with different values (denominations) and same dimensions, and an envelope with a fixed maximum number of stamp positions. The local postage stamp problem is to find the smallest value that cannot be realized by the sum of the stamps on the envelope. The global postage stamp problem is to find the set of denominations that maximize that smallest value for a fixed number of distinct denominations. The local problem is NP-hard and we propose here a novel algorithm that improves on both the time complexity bound and the amount of required memory.  We also propose a polynomial approximation algorithm for the global problem together with its complexity analysis. Finally we show that our algorithms allow to improve secure multi-party computations on sets via a more efficient homomorphic evaluation of polynomials on ciphered values.

We also show that the optimal redundancy is between $t\log_q n+Ω(1)$ and $2t\log_q n-\log_q\log_2 n+O(1)$, so our explicit construction matches the existential upper bound to first order. In contrast, for the classical adversarial $q$-ary deletion channel, the smallest redundancy achieved by known explicit constructions that correct up to $t$ deletions is $4t(1+ε)\log_q n+o(\log n)$.

### 4. [Improved Approximations for Dial-a-Ride Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21652v1)

Authors: Jingyang Zhao, Mingyu Xiao

The multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (mDaRP) is a fundamental vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries, widely applicable in ride-sharing, economics, and transportation. Given a set of $n$ locations, $h$ vehicles of identical capacity $λ$ located at various depots, and $m$ ride requests each defined by a source and a destination, the goal is to plan non-preemptive routes that serve all requests while minimizing the total travel distance, ensuring that no vehicle carries more than $λ$ passengers at any time. The best-known approximation ratio for the mDaRP remains $\mathcal{O}(\sqrtλ\log m)$.
  We propose two simple algorithms: the first achieves the same approximation ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrtλ\log m)$ with improved running time, and the second attains an approximation ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{m}λ})$. A combination of them yields an approximation ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt[4]{n}\log^{\frac{1}{2}}n)$ under $m=Θ(n)$. Moreover, for the case $m\gg n$, by extending our algorithms, we derive an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n\log n})$-approximation algorithm, which also improves the current best-known approximation ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}\log^2n)$ for the classic (single-vehicle) DaRP, obtained by Gupta et al. (ACM Trans. Algorithms, 2010).

### 5. [Quantifying Noise in Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21237v1)

Authors: Aaron Li, Ian Zhang

Kleinberg and Mullainathan recently proposed a formal framework for studying the phenomenon of language generation, called language generation in the limit. In this model, an adversary gives an enumeration of example strings from an unknown target language, and the algorithm is tasked with correctly generating unseen strings from the target language within finite time. Refined notions of non-uniform and uniform generation were later introduced by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2025), and a noisy model was introduced by Raman and Raman (2025), which allows the adversary to insert extraneous strings. A natural question in the noisy model is to quantify the effect of noise, by studying the impact of each additional extraneous string. We show two complementary results in this setting. We first show that for both uniform and non-uniform generation, a single noisy string strictly reduces the set of collections that can be generated, thus answering an open question in Raman and Raman (2025). Then, we show for both uniform and non-uniform generation that generation with a single noisy string is equivalent to generation with any finite amount of noise, sharply contrasting with the strict hierarchy for noisy generation in the limit shown by Bai, Panigrahi, and Zhang (2026). Finally, we leverage our previous results to provide the first known characterization for non-uniform noise-dependent generatability.

### 6. [When Local and Non-Local Meet: Quadratic Improvement for Edge Estimation with Independent Set Queries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21457v1)

Authors: Tomer Adar, Yahel Hotam, Amit Levi

We study the problem of estimating the number of edges in an unknown graph. We consider a hybrid model in which an algorithm may issue independent set, degree, and neighbor queries. We show that this model admits strictly more efficient edge estimation than either access type alone. Specifically, we give a randomized algorithm that outputs a $(1\pm\varepsilon)$-approximation of the number of edges using $O\left(\min\left(\sqrt{m}, \sqrt{\frac{n}{\sqrt{m}}}\right)\cdot\frac{\log n}{\varepsilon^{5/2}}\right)$ queries, and prove a nearly matching lower bound.
  In contrast, prior work shows that in the local query model (Goldreich and Ron, \textit{Random Structures \& Algorithms} 2008) and in the independent set query model (Beame \emph{et al.} ITCS 2018, Chen \emph{et al.} SODA 2020), edge estimation requires $\widetildeΘ(n/\sqrt{m})$ queries in the same parameter regimes. Our results therefore yield a quadratic improvement in the hybrid model, and no asymptotically better improvement is possible.

### 7. [Improved Approximations for the Unsplittable Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21660v1)

Authors: Jingyang Zhao, Mingyu Xiao

The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is one of the most extensively studied problems in combinatorial optimization. In this problem, we are given a depot and a set of customers, each with a demand, embedded in a metric space. The objective is to find a set of tours, each starting and ending at the depot, operated by the capacititated vehicle at the depot to serve all customers, such that all customers are served, and the total travel cost is minimized. We consider the unplittable variant, where the demand of each customer must be served entirely by a single tour. Let $α$ denote the current best-known approximation ratio for the metric traveling salesman problem. The previous best approximation ratio was $α+1+\ln 2+δ<3.1932$ for a small constant $δ>0$ (Friggstad et al., Math. Oper. Res. 2025), which can be further improved by a small constant using the result of Blauth, Traub, and Vygen (Math. Program. 2023). In this paper, we propose two improved approximation algorithms. The first algorithm focuses on the case of fixed vehicle capacity and achieves an approximation ratio of $α+1+\ln\bigl(2-\frac{1}{2}y_0\bigr)<3.0897$, where $y_0>0.39312$ is the unique root of $\ln\bigl(2-\frac{1}{2}y\bigr)=\frac{3}{2}y$. The second algorithm considers general vehicle capacity and achieves an approximation ratio of $α+1+y_1+\ln\left(2-2y_1\right)+δ<3.1759$ for a small constant $δ>0$, where $y_1>0.17458$ is the unique root of $\frac{1}{2} y_1+ 6 (1-y_1)\bigl(1-e^{-\frac{1}{2} y_1}\bigr) =\ln\left(2-2y_1\right)$. Both approximations can be further improved by a small constant using the result of Blauth, Traub, and Vygen (Math. Program. 2023).

Authors: Ryan L. Mann, Gabriel Waite

We establish efficient algorithms for weakly-interacting quantum spin systems at arbitrary temperature. In particular, we obtain a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the partition function and an efficient approximate sampling scheme for the thermal distribution over a classical spin space. Our approach is based on the cluster expansion method and a standard reduction from approximate sampling to approximate counting.

Authors: Sai Pavan Deram, Jacopo Pegoraro, Javier Lorca Hernando, Jesus O. Lacruz, Joerg Widmer

Near-field localization for ISAC requires large-aperture arrays, making fully-digital implementations prohibitively complex and costly. While sparse subarray architectures can reduce cost, they introduce severe estimation ambiguity from grating lobes. To address both issues, we propose SHARE (Sparse Hierarchical Angle-Range Estimation), a novel two-stage sparse recovery algorithm. SHARE operates in two stages. It first performs coarse, unambiguous angle estimation using individual subarrays to resolve the grating lobe ambiguity. It then leverages the full sparse aperture to perform a localized joint angle-range search. This hierarchical approach avoids an exhaustive and computationally intensive two-dimensional grid search while preserving the high resolution of the large aperture. Simulation results show that SHARE significantly outperforms conventional one-shot sparse recovery methods, such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), in both localization accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we show that SHARE's overall localization accuracy is comparable to or even surpasses that of the fully-digital 2D-MUSIC algorithm, despite MUSIC having access to the complete, uncompressed data from every antenna element. SHARE therefore provides a practical path for high-resolution near-field ISAC systems.

### 2. [User Acceptance Model for Smart Incentives in Sustainable Video Streaming towards 6G](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21903v1)

Authors: Konstantinos Varsos, Adamantia Stamou, George D. Stamoulis, Vasillios A. Siris

The rapid growth of 5G video streaming is intensifying energy consumption across access, core, and data-center networks, underscoring the critical need for energy and carbon-efficient solutions. While reducing streaming bitrates improves energy efficiency, its success hinges on user acceptance--particularly when lower bitrates may be perceived as reduced quality of experience (QoE). Therefore, there is a need to develop transparent, user-centric incentive models that balance sustainability with perceived value. We propose a user-acceptance model that combines diverse environmental awareness, personalized responsiveness to incentives, and varying levels of altruism into a unified probabilistic framework. The model incorporates dynamic, individualized incentives that adapt over time. We further enhance the framework by incorporating (i) social well-being as a motivator for altruistic choices, (ii) provider-driven education strategies that gradually adjust user acceptance thresholds, and (iii) data-driven learning of user traits from historical offer--response interactions. Extensive synthetic-data experiments reveal the trade-offs between provider cost and network flexibility, showing that personalized incentives and gradual behavioral adaptation can advance sustainability targets without compromising stakeholder requirements.

### 3. [Optimal Energy-Aware Service Management in Future Networks with a Gamified Incentives Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21846v1)

Authors: Konstantinos Varsos, Adamantia Stamou, George D. Stamoulis, Vasillios A. Siris

As energy demands surge across ICT infrastructures, service providers must engage users in sustainable practices while maintaining the Quality of Experience (QoE) at acceptable levels. In this paper, we introduce such an approach, leveraging gamified incentives and a model for user's acceptance on incentives, thus encouraging energy-efficient behaviors such as adaptive bitrate streaming. Each user is characterized by an environmental sensitivity factor and a private incentive threshold, shaping probabilistic responses to energy-saving offers. A serious-game mechanism based on positive behavioral reinforcement and rewards of the users, due to their inclusion in top-K and bottom-M rankings, fosters peer comparison and competition, thus transforming passive acceptance into active engagement. Moreover, within a Stackelberg game formulation, the video streaming service provider--acting as the strategic leader--optimizes both incentive levels and game parameters to achieve network-wide energy and traffic reductions, while adhering to budgetary constraints. This structured approach empowers providers with proactive, application-level control over energy consumption, offering them measurable benefits such as reduced high-bitrate traffic and increased participation in energy-saving behaviors, while also considering user satisfaction. The results of our simulations show that indeed gamification boosts significantly user participation and energy savings provided that the incentive and game parameters are chosen optimally.

Authors: Shaina Raza, Iuliia Eyriay, Ahmed Y. Radwan, Nate Lesperance, Deval Pandya, Sedef Akinli Kocak, Graham W. Taylor

Open-source AI is scaling rapidly, and model hubs now host millions of artifacts. Each foundation model can spawn large numbers of fine-tunes, adapters, quantizations, merges, and forks. We take the position that compute efficiency alone is insufficient for sustainability in open-source AI: lower per-run costs can accelerate experimentation and deployment, increasing aggregate environmental footprint unless impacts are measurable and comparable across derivative lineages. However, the energy use, water consumption, and emissions of these derivative lineages are rarely measured or disclosed in a consistent, comparable manner, leaving ecosystem-level impact largely invisible. We argue that sustainable open-source AI requires coordination infrastructure that tracks impacts across model lineages, not only base models. We propose Data and Impact Accounting (DIA), a lightweight, non-restrictive transparency layer that (i) standardizes carbon and water reporting metadata, (ii) integrates low-friction measurement into common training and inference pipelines, and (iii) aggregates reports through public dashboards to summarize cumulative impacts across releases and derivatives. DIA makes derivative costs visible and supports ecosystem-level accountability while preserving openness. https://vectorinstitute.github.io/ai-impact-accounting/

Authors: Qingshan Wang, Clara C. Wanjura, Florian Marquardt

The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

### 6. [Frequency as Aperture: Enabling Embeddable Near-Field Sensing for 6G Wireless Radios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21584v1)

Authors: Pin-Han Ho, Limei Peng, Yiming Miao, Xu Fan, Kairan Liang, Haoran Mei, Wei Duan

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be natively supported by future 6G wireless radios, yet most mmWave sensing solutions still rely on dedicated radar hardware incompatible with cost and power constrained wireless nodes. This article introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a wireless-first sensing paradigm that repurposes inherent frequency agility into a virtual sensing aperture, enabling near-field perception with minimal RF front end complexity. Using a single RF chain and a frequency-scanning leaky-wave antenna, FaA achieves two dimensional spatial sensing by reusing the local oscillator (LO) frequency sweep already employed for wideband communication. From a wireless-system perspective, this shifts spatial sampling from the antenna domain to the frequency domain, embedding radar-grade spatial fingerprints directly into the communication RF chain. A case study shows that FaA provides fine angular and range discrimination with low power consumption and unit cost, demonstrating significantly higher architectural efficiency than conventional multi-channel MIMO based sensing under identical physical and spectral constraints. These results indicate that near-field sensing can be seamlessly integrated into frequency-agile wireless radios, enabling hardware-efficient, embeddable, and privacy-preserving ISAC nodes for smart homes, wearables, and industrial edge deployments.

Authors: Irene Ambrosini, Ingo Blakowski, Dmitrii Zendrikov, Cristiano Capone, Luna Gava, Giacomo Indiveri, Chiara De Luca, Chiara Bartolozzi

Air hockey demands split-second decisions at high puck velocities, a challenge we address with a compact network of spiking neurons running on a mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor. By co-designing hardware and learning algorithms, we train the system to achieve successful puck interactions through reinforcement learning in a remarkably small number of trials. The network leverages fixed random connectivity to capture the task's temporal structure and adopts a local e-prop learning rule in the readout layer to exploit event-driven activity for fast and efficient learning. The result is real-time learning with a setup comprising a computer and the neuromorphic chip in-the-loop, enabling practical training of spiking neural networks for robotic autonomous systems. This work bridges neuroscience-inspired hardware with real-world robotic control, showing that brain-inspired approaches can tackle fast-paced interaction tasks while supporting always-on learning in intelligent machines.

### 8. [Mind the Gap: How Elicitation Protocols Shape the Stated-Revealed Preference Gap in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21975v1)

Authors: Pranav Mahajan, Ihor Kendiukhov, Syed Hussain, Lydia Nottingham

Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

### 9. [Synthetic Pattern Generation and Detection of Financial Activities using Graph Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21446v1)

Authors: Francesco Zola, Lucia Muñoz, Andrea Venturi, Amaia Gil

Illicit financial activities such as money laundering often manifest through recurrent topological patterns in transaction networks. Detecting these patterns automatically remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled real-world data and strict privacy constraints. To address this, we investigate whether Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) can effectively learn and distinguish topological patterns that mimic money laundering operations when trained on synthetic data. The analysis consists of two phases: (i) data generation, where synthetic samples are created for seven well-known illicit activity patterns using parametrized generators that preserve structural consistency while introducing realistic variability; and (ii) model training and validation, where separate GAEs are trained on each pattern without explicit labels, relying solely on reconstruction error as an indicator of learned structure. We compare three GAE implementations based on three distinct convolutional layers: Graph Convolutional (GAE-GCN), GraphSAGE (GAE-SAGE), and Graph Attention Network (GAE-GAT). Experimental results show that GAE-GCN achieves the most consistent reconstruction performance across patterns, while GAE-SAGE and GAE-GAT exhibit competitive results only in few specific patterns. These findings suggest that graph-based representation learning on synthetic data provides a viable path toward developing AI-driven tools for detecting illicit behaviors, overcoming the limitations of financial datasets.

### 10. [Mixed-Precision Training and Compilation for RRAM-based Computing-in-Memory Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21737v1)

Authors: Rebecca Pelke, Joel Klein, Jose Cubero-Cascante, Nils Bosbach, Jan Moritz Joseph, Rainer Leupers

Computing-in-Memory (CIM) accelerators are a promising solution for accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads, as they perform Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs) on crossbar arrays directly in memory. Although the bit widths of the crossbar inputs and cells are very limited, most CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8 bit. As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %.

### 1. [Cellular Automaton Reducibility as a Measure of Complexity for Infinite Words](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21862v1)

Authors: Markel Zubia, Herman Geuvers

Infinite words, also known as streams, hold significant interest in computer science and mathematics, raising the natural question of how their complexity should be measured. We introduce cellular automaton reducibility as a measure of stream complexity: σ is at least as complex as τ when there exists a cellular automaton mapping σ to τ. This enables the categorization of streams into degrees of complexity, analogous to Turing degrees in computability theory. We investigate the algebraic properties of the hierarchy that emerges from the partial ordering of degrees, showing that it is not well-founded and not dense, that ultimately periodic streams are ordered by divisibility of their period, that sparse streams are atoms, that maximal streams have maximal subword complexity, and that suprema of sets of streams do not generally exist. We also provide a pseudo-algorithm for classifying streams up to this reducibility.

Authors: Ruiqi Zhang, Jiacheng Wu, Jie Chen

Surfaces are typically represented as meshes, which can be extracted from volumetric fields via meshing or optimized directly as surface parameterizations. Volumetric representations occupy 3D space and have a large effective receptive field along rays, enabling stable and efficient optimization via volumetric rendering; however, subsequent meshing often produces overly dense meshes and introduces accumulated errors. In contrast, pure surface methods avoid meshing but capture only boundary geometry with a single-layer receptive field, making it difficult to learn intricate geometric details and increasing reliance on priors (e.g., shading or normals). We bridge this gap by differentiably turning a surface representation into a volumetric one, enabling end-to-end surface reconstruction via volumetric rendering to model complex geometries. Specifically, we soften a mesh into multiple semi-transparent layers that remain differentiable with respect to the base mesh, endowing it with a controllable 3D receptive field. Combined with a splatting-based renderer and a topology-control strategy, our method can be optimized in about 20 minutes to achieve accurate surface reconstruction while substantially improving mesh quality.

### 2. [Synthetic-to-Real Domain Bridging for Single-View 3D Reconstruction of Ships for Maritime Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21786v1)

Authors: Borja Carrillo-Perez, Felix Sattler, Angel Bueno Rodriguez, Maurice Stephan, Sarah Barnes

Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of ships is an important part of maritime monitoring, allowing improved visualization, inspection, and decision-making in real-world monitoring environments. However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

Authors: Anthony Chen, Naomi Ken Korem, Tavi Halperin, Matan Ben Yosef, Urska Jelercic, Ofir Bibi, Or Patashnik, Daniel Cohen-Or

Audio-Visual Foundation Models, which are pretrained to jointly generate sound and visual content, have recently shown an unprecedented ability to model multi-modal generation and editing, opening new opportunities for downstream tasks. Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.

### 4. [Optimization and Mobile Deployment for Anthropocene Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21141v1)

Authors: Po-Hsun Chen, Ivan C. H. Liu

This paper presents AnthropoCam, a mobile-based neural style transfer (NST) system optimized for the visual synthesis of Anthropocene environments. Unlike conventional artistic NST, which prioritizes painterly abstraction, stylizing human-altered landscapes demands a careful balance between amplifying material textures and preserving semantic legibility. Industrial infrastructures, waste accumulations, and modified ecosystems contain dense, repetitive patterns that are visually expressive yet highly susceptible to semantic erosion under aggressive style transfer.
  To address this challenge, we systematically investigate the impact of NST parameter configurations on the visual translation of Anthropocene textures, including feature layer selection, style and content loss weighting, training stability, and output resolution. Through controlled experiments, we identify an optimal parameter manifold that maximizes stylistic expression while preventing semantic erasure. Our results demonstrate that appropriate combinations of convolutional depth, loss ratios, and resolution scaling enable the faithful transformation of anthropogenic material properties into a coherent visual language.
  Building on these findings, we implement a low-latency, feed-forward NST pipeline deployed on mobile devices. The system integrates a React Native frontend with a Flask-based GPU backend, achieving high-resolution inference within 3-5 seconds on general mobile hardware. This enables real-time, in-situ visual intervention at the site of image capture, supporting participatory engagement with Anthropocene landscapes.
  By coupling domain-specific NST optimization with mobile deployment, AnthropoCam reframes neural style transfer as a practical and expressive tool for real-time environmental visualization in the Anthropocene.

Volumetric medical imaging offers great potential for understanding complex pathologies. Yet, traditional 2D slices provide little support for interpreting spatial relationships, forcing users to mentally reconstruct anatomy into three dimensions. Direct volumetric path tracing and VR rendering can improve perception but are computationally expensive, while precomputed representations, like Gaussian Splatting, require planning ahead. Both approaches limit interactive use.
  We propose a hybrid rendering approach for high-quality, interactive, and immersive anatomical visualization. Our method combines streamed foveated path tracing with a lightweight Gaussian Splatting approximation of the periphery. The peripheral model generation is optimized with volume data and continuously refined using foveal renderings, enabling interactive updates. Depth-guided reprojection further improves robustness to latency and allows users to balance fidelity with refresh rate.
  We compare our method against direct path tracing and Gaussian Splatting. Our results highlight how their combination can preserve strengths in visual quality while re-generating the peripheral model in under a second, eliminating extensive preprocessing and approximations. This opens new options for interactive medical visualization.

### 6. [HiFi-Mesh: High-Fidelity Efficient 3D Mesh Generation via Compact Autoregressive Dependence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21314v1)

Authors: Yanfeng Li, Tao Tan, Qingquan Gao, Zhiwen Cao, Xiaohong liu, Yue Sun

High-fidelity 3D meshes can be tokenized into one-dimension (1D) sequences and directly modeled using autoregressive approaches for faces and vertices. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, resulting in slow inference and the ability to handle only small-scale sequences, which severely constrains the expressible structural details. We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation.

Authors: John Flynn, Wolfgang Paier, Dimitar Dinev, Sam Nhut Nguyen, Hayk Poghosyan, Manuel Toribio, Sandipan Banerjee, Guy Gafni

Current generative video models excel at producing novel content from text and image prompts, but leave a critical gap in editing existing pre-recorded videos, where minor alterations to the spoken script require preserving motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and accurate lip synchronization. We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations. This work represents a foundational step toward generative video models as practical tools for professional video post-production.

### 1. [Alliance Mechanisms in General Lotto Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21319v1)

Authors: Vade Shah, Jason R. Marden

How do different alliance mechanisms compare? In this work, we analyze various methods of forming an alliance in the Coalitional General Lotto game, a simple model of competitive resource allocation. In the game, Players 1 and 2 independently compete against a common Adversary by allocating their limited resource budgets towards separate sets of contests; an agent wins a contest by allocating more resources towards it than their opponent. In this setting, we study three alliance mechanisms: budget transfers (resource donation), contest transfers (contest redistribution), and joint transfers (both simultaneously). For all three mechanisms, we study when they present opportunities for collective improvement (the sum of the Players' payoffs increases) or mutual improvement (both Players' individual payoffs increase). In our first result, we show that all three are fundamentally different with regards to mutual improvement; in particular, mutually beneficial budget and contest transfers exist in distinct, limited subsets of games, whereas mutually beneficial joint transfers exist in almost all games. However, in our second result, we demonstrate that all three mechanisms are equivalent when it comes to collective improvement; that is, collectively beneficial budget, contest, and joint transfers exist in almost all game instances, and all three mechanisms achieve the same maximum collective payoff. Together, these results demonstrate that differences between mechanisms depend fundamentally on the objective of the alliance.

### 2. [Optimal Energy-Aware Service Management in Future Networks with a Gamified Incentives Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21846v1)

Authors: Konstantinos Varsos, Adamantia Stamou, George D. Stamoulis, Vasillios A. Siris

As energy demands surge across ICT infrastructures, service providers must engage users in sustainable practices while maintaining the Quality of Experience (QoE) at acceptable levels. In this paper, we introduce such an approach, leveraging gamified incentives and a model for user's acceptance on incentives, thus encouraging energy-efficient behaviors such as adaptive bitrate streaming. Each user is characterized by an environmental sensitivity factor and a private incentive threshold, shaping probabilistic responses to energy-saving offers. A serious-game mechanism based on positive behavioral reinforcement and rewards of the users, due to their inclusion in top-K and bottom-M rankings, fosters peer comparison and competition, thus transforming passive acceptance into active engagement. Moreover, within a Stackelberg game formulation, the video streaming service provider--acting as the strategic leader--optimizes both incentive levels and game parameters to achieve network-wide energy and traffic reductions, while adhering to budgetary constraints. This structured approach empowers providers with proactive, application-level control over energy consumption, offering them measurable benefits such as reduced high-bitrate traffic and increased participation in energy-saving behaviors, while also considering user satisfaction. The results of our simulations show that indeed gamification boosts significantly user participation and energy savings provided that the incentive and game parameters are chosen optimally.

### 3. [Test-Time Compute Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21839v1)

Authors: Ander Artola Velasco, Dimitrios Rontogiannis, Stratis Tsirtsis, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez

Test-time compute has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, this strategy has in turn increased how much users pay cloud-based providers offering LLM-as-a-service, since providers charge users for the amount of test-time compute they use to generate an output. In our work, we show that the market of LLM-as-a-service is socially inefficient: providers have a financial incentive to increase the amount of test-time compute, even if this increase contributes little to the quality of the outputs. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a reverse second-price auction mechanism where providers bid their offered price and (expected) quality for the opportunity to serve a user, and users pay proportionally to the marginal value generated by the winning provider relative to the second-highest bidder. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with multiple instruct models from the $\texttt{Llama}$ and $\texttt{Qwen}$ families, as well as reasoning models distilled from $\texttt{DeepSeek-R1}$, on math and science benchmark datasets.

Authors: Jason Hartline

A fundamental challenge for modern economics is to understand what happens when actors in an economy are replaced with algorithms. Like rationality has enabled understanding of outcomes of classical economic actors, no-regret can enable the understanding of outcomes of algorithmic actors. This review article covers the classical computer science literature on no-regret algorithms to provide a foundation for an overview of the latest economics research on no-regret algorithms, focusing on the emerging topics of manipulation, statistical inference, and algorithmic collusion.

### 5. [Shortlisting: a Principled Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21277v1)

Authors: Edith Elkind, Qishen Han, Lirong Xia

Shortlisting is the process of selecting a subset of alternatives from a larger pool for further consideration or final decision-making. It is widely applied in social choice and multi-agent system scenarios. The growing demand for participatory decision-making and the continuously expanding space of candidates create an urgent need for efficient and fair shortlisting procedures. However, little principled study has been done on this problem. This blue-sky paper aims to highlight the overlooked significance of shortlisting, distinguish it from related problems, provide initial thoughts, and, more importantly, serve as a call to arms. We envision that principled shortlisting can reduce cognitive burden, enable fair collective decisions, encourage broader participation, and ultimately build trust in democratic systems.

### 6. [Post-Disaster Resource Redistribution and Cooperation Evolution Based on Two-Layer Network Evolutionary Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22021v1)

Authors: Yu Chen, Genjiu Xu, Sinan Feng, Chaoqian Wang

In the aftermath of large-scale disasters, the scarcity of resources and the paralysis of infrastructure raise severe challenges to effective post-disaster recovery. Efficient coordination between shelters and victims plays a crucial role in building community resilience, yet the evolution of two-layer behavioral feedback between these two groups through network coupling remains insufficiently understood. Here, this study develops a two-layer network to capture the cross-layer coupling between shelters and victims. The upper layer uses a post-disaster emergency resource redistribution model within the framework of the public goods game, while the lower layer adopts a cooperative evolutionary game to describe internal victim interactions. Monte Carlo simulations on scale-free networks reveal threshold effects of incentives: moderate public goods enhancement and subsidies promote cooperation, whereas excessive incentives induce free-riding. In contrast, credible and well-executed punishment effectively suppresses defection. Targeted punishment of highly connected shelters significantly enhances cooperation under resource constraints. A comparative analysis using a network generated from the actual coordinates of Beijing shelters confirms the model's generality and practical applicability. The findings highlight the importance of calibrated incentives, enforceable sanctions, and structural targeting in fostering robust cooperation across organizational and individual levels in post-disaster environments.

### Human-Computer Interaction

### 1. [Organizational Practices and Socio-Technical Design of Human-Centered AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21492v1)

Authors: Thomas Herrmann

This contribution explores how the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into organizational practices can be effectively framed through a socio-technical perspective to comply with the requirements of Human-centered AI (HCAI). Instead of viewing AI merely as a technical tool, the analysis emphasizes the importance of embedding AI into communication, collaboration, and decision-making processes within organizations from a human-centered perspective. Ten case-based patterns illustrate how AI support of predictive maintenance can be organized to address quality assurance and continuous improvement and to provide different types of sup-port for HCAI. The analysis shows that AI adoption often requires and enables new forms of organizational learning, where specialists jointly interpret AI output, adapt workflows, and refine rules for system improve-ment. Different dimensions and levels of socio-technical integration of AI are considered to reflect the effort and benefits of keeping the organization in the loop.

### 2. [Are they just delegating? Cross-Sample Predictions on University Students' & Teachers' Use of AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21490v1)

Authors: Fabian Albers, Sebastian Strauß, Nikol Rummel, Nils Köbis

Mutual trust between teachers and students is a prerequisite for effective teaching, learning, and assessment in higher education. Accurate predictions about the other group's use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) are fundamental for such trust. However, the disruptive rise of AI has transformed academic work practices, raising important questions about how teachers and students use these tools and how well they can estimate each other's usage. While the frequency of use is well studied, little is known about how AI is used, and comparisons with similar practices are rare. This study surveyed German university teachers (N = 113) and students (N = 123) on the frequency of AI use and the degree of delegation across six identical academic tasks. Participants also provided incentivized cross-sample predictions of the other group's AI use to assess the accuracy of their predictions. We find that students reported higher use of AI and greater delegation than teachers. Both groups significantly overestimated the other group's use, with teachers predicting very frequent use and high delegation by students, and students assuming teachers use AI similarly to themselves. These findings reveal a perception gap between teachers' and students' expectations and actual AI use. Such gaps may hinder trust and effective collaboration, underscoring the need for open dialogue about AI practices in academia and for policies that support the equitable and transparent integration of AI tools in higher education.

Authors: Tram Thi Minh Tran, Soojeong Yoo, Oliver Weidlich, Yidan Cao, Xinyan Yu, Xin Cheng, Yin Ye, Natalia Gulbransen-Diaz, Callum Parker

While visual augmentation dominates the augmented reality landscape, devices like Meta Ray-Ban audio smart glasses signal growing industry movement toward audio augmented reality (AAR). Hearing is a primary channel for sensing context, anticipating change, and navigating social space, yet AAR's everyday potential remains underexplored. We address this gap through a collaborative autoethnography (N=5, authoring) and an online survey (N=74). We identify ten roles for AAR, grouped into three categories: task- and utility-oriented, emotional and social, and perceptual collaborator. These roles are further layered with a rhythmic and embodied collaborator framing, mapping them onto micro-, meso-, and macro-rhythms of everyday life. Our analysis surfaces nuanced tensions, such as blocking distractions without erasing social presence, highlighting the need for context-aware design. This paper contributes a foundational and forward-looking framework for AAR in everyday life, providing design groundwork for systems attuned to daily routines, sensory engagement, and social expectations.

### 4. [Auditorily Embodied Conversational Agents: Effects of Spatialization and Situated Audio Cues on Presence and Social Perception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22082v1)

Authors: Yi Fei Cheng, Jarod Bloch, Alexander Wang, Andrea Bianchi, Anusha Withana, Anhong Guo, Laurie M. Heller, David Lindlbauer

Embodiment can enhance conversational agents, such as increasing their perceived presence. This is typically achieved through visual representations of a virtual body; however, visual modalities are not always available, such as when users interact with agents using headphones or display-less glasses. In this work, we explore auditory embodiment. By introducing auditory cues of bodily presence - through spatially localized voice and situated Foley audio from environmental interactions - we investigate how audio alone can convey embodiment and influence perceptions of a conversational agent. We conducted a 2 (spatialization: monaural vs. spatialized) x 2 (Foley: none vs. Foley) within-subjects study, where participants (n=24) engaged in conversations with agents. Our results show that spatialization and Foley increase co-presence, but reduce users' perceptions of the agent's attention and other social attributes.

### 5. [Dynamic Framework for Collaborative Learning: Leveraging Advanced LLM with Adaptive Feedback Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21344v1)

Authors: Hassam Tahir, Faizan Faisal, Fady Alnajjar, Muhammad Imran Taj, Lucia Gordon, Aila Khan, Michael Lwin, Omar Mubin

This paper presents a framework for integrating LLM into collaborative learning platforms to enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and inclusivity. The framework employs advanced LLMs as dynamic moderators to facilitate real-time discussions and adapt to learners' evolving needs, ensuring diverse and inclusive educational experiences. Key innovations include robust feedback mechanisms that refine AI moderation, promote reflective learning, and balance participation among users. The system's modular architecture featuring ReactJS for the frontend, Flask for backend operations, and efficient question retrieval supports personalized and engaging interactions through dynamic adjustments to prompts and discussion flows. Testing demonstrates that the framework significantly improves student collaboration, fosters deeper comprehension, and scales effectively across various subjects and user groups. By addressing limitations in static moderation and personalization in existing systems, this work establishes a strong foundation for next-generation AI-driven educational tools, advancing equitable and impactful learning outcomes.

### 6. [CAF-Mamba: Mamba-Based Cross-Modal Adaptive Attention Fusion for Multimodal Depression Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21648v1)

Authors: Bowen Zhou, Marc-André Fiedler, Ayoub Al-Hamadi

Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that severely impairs daily functioning and quality of life. While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Experiments on two in-the-wild benchmark datasets, LMVD and D-Vlog, demonstrate that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Authors: Yichun Zhao, Miguel A. Nacenta, Mahadeo A. Sukhai, Sowmya Somanath

Blind and low-vision (BLV) employees in mixed-visual ability teams often encounter information (e.g., PDFs, diagrams) in inaccessible formats. To enable teamwork, teams must transform these representations by modifying or re-creating them into accessible forms. However, these transformations are frequently overlooked, lack infrastructural support, and cause additional labour. To design systems that move beyond one-off accommodations to effective mixed-ability collaboration, we need a deeper understanding of the representations, their transformations and how they occur. We conducted a week-long diary study with follow-up interviews with 23 BLV and sighted professionals from five legal, non-profit, and consulting teams, documenting 36 transformation cases. Our analysis characterizes how teams perform representational transformations for accessibility: how they are triggered proactively or reactively, how they simplify or enhance, and four common patterns in which workers coordinate with each other to address representational incompatibility. Our findings uncover opportunities for designing systems that can better support mixed-visual ability work.

### 8. [Vidmento: Creating Video Stories Through Context-Aware Expansion With Generative Video](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22013v1)

Authors: Catherine Yeh, Anh Truong, Mira Dontcheva, Bryan Wang

Video storytelling is often constrained by available material, limiting creative expression and leaving undesired narrative gaps. Generative video offers a new way to address these limitations by augmenting captured media with tailored visuals. To explore this potential, we interviewed eight video creators to identify opportunities and challenges in integrating generative video into their workflows. Building on these insights and established filmmaking principles, we developed Vidmento, a tool for authoring hybrid video stories that combine captured and generated media through context-aware expansion. Vidmento surfaces opportunities for story development, generates clips that blend stylistically and narratively with surrounding media, and provides controls for refinement. In a study with 12 creators, Vidmento supported narrative development and exploration by systematically expanding initial materials with generative media, enabling expressive video storytelling aligned with creative intent. We highlight how creators bridge story gaps with generative content and where they find this blending capability most valuable.

### 9. [How do Visual Attributes Influence Web Agents? A Comprehensive Evaluation of User Interface Design Factors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21961v1)

Authors: Kuai Yu, Naicheng Yu, Han Wang, Rui Yang, Huan Zhang

Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.

### 10. [Optimization and Mobile Deployment for Anthropocene Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21141v1)

Authors: Po-Hsun Chen, Ivan C. H. Liu

This paper presents AnthropoCam, a mobile-based neural style transfer (NST) system optimized for the visual synthesis of Anthropocene environments. Unlike conventional artistic NST, which prioritizes painterly abstraction, stylizing human-altered landscapes demands a careful balance between amplifying material textures and preserving semantic legibility. Industrial infrastructures, waste accumulations, and modified ecosystems contain dense, repetitive patterns that are visually expressive yet highly susceptible to semantic erosion under aggressive style transfer.
  To address this challenge, we systematically investigate the impact of NST parameter configurations on the visual translation of Anthropocene textures, including feature layer selection, style and content loss weighting, training stability, and output resolution. Through controlled experiments, we identify an optimal parameter manifold that maximizes stylistic expression while preventing semantic erasure. Our results demonstrate that appropriate combinations of convolutional depth, loss ratios, and resolution scaling enable the faithful transformation of anthropogenic material properties into a coherent visual language.
  Building on these findings, we implement a low-latency, feed-forward NST pipeline deployed on mobile devices. The system integrates a React Native frontend with a Flask-based GPU backend, achieving high-resolution inference within 3-5 seconds on general mobile hardware. This enables real-time, in-situ visual intervention at the site of image capture, supporting participatory engagement with Anthropocene landscapes.
  By coupling domain-specific NST optimization with mobile deployment, AnthropoCam reframes neural style transfer as a practical and expressive tool for real-time environmental visualization in the Anthropocene.

### Information Retrieval

### 1. [Toward Culturally Aligned LLMs through Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21700v1)

Authors: Wonduk Seo, Wonseok Choi, Junseo Koh, Juhyeon Lee, Hyunjin An, Minhyeong Yu, Jian Park, Qingshan Zhou, Seunghyun Lee, Yi Bu

Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.

### 2. [LEMUR: Learned Multi-Vector Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21853v1)

Authors: Elias Jääsaari, Ville Hyvönen, Teemu Roos

Multi-vector representations generated by late interaction models, such as ColBERT, enable superior retrieval quality compared to single-vector representations in information retrieval applications. In multi-vector retrieval systems, both queries and documents are encoded using one embedding for each token, and similarity between queries and documents is measured by the MaxSim similarity measure. However, the improved recall of multi-vector retrieval comes at the expense of significantly increased latency. This necessitates designing efficient approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms for multi-vector search. In this work, we introduce LEMUR, a simple-yet-efficient framework for multi-vector similarity search. LEMUR consists of two consecutive problem reductions: We first formulate multi-vector similarity search as a supervised learning problem that can be solved using a one-hidden-layer neural network. Second, we reduce inference under this model to single-vector similarity search in its latent space, which enables the use of existing single-vector ANNS methods for speeding up retrieval. In addition to performance evaluation on ColBERTv2 embeddings, we evaluate LEMUR on embeddings generated by modern multi-vector text models and multi-vector visual document retrieval models. LEMUR is an order of magnitude faster than earlier multi-vector similarity search methods.

### 3. [Thinking Broad, Acting Fast: Latent Reasoning Distillation from Multi-Perspective Chain-of-Thought for E-Commerce Relevance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21611v1)

Authors: Baopu Qiu, Hao Chen, Yuanrong Wu, Changtong Zan, Chao Wei, Weiru Zhang, Xiaoyi Zeng

Effective relevance modeling is crucial for e-commerce search, as it aligns search results with user intent and enhances customer experience. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner. For distillation, we introduce Latent Reasoning Knowledge Distillation (LRKD), which endows a student model with a lightweight inference-time latent reasoning extractor, allowing efficient and low-latency internalization of the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities. Evaluated in offline experiments and online A/B tests on an e-commerce search advertising platform serving tens of millions of users daily, our method delivers significant offline gains, showing clear benefits in both commercial performance and user experience.

### 4. [When should I search more: Adaptive Complex Query Optimization with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21208v1)

Authors: Wei Wen, Sihang Deng, Tianjun Wei, Keyu Chen, Ruizhi Qiao, Xing Sun

Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

### 5. [When "Better" Prompts Hurt: Evaluation-Driven Iteration for LLM Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22025v1)

Authors: Daniel Commey

Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.
  We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.
  In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic "improved" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.
  All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.

### 6. [ProRAG: Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21912v1)

Authors: Zhao Wang, Ziliang Zhao, Zhicheng Dou

Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to "process hallucinations", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision. The code and model are available at https://github.com/lilinwz/ProRAG.

Authors: Daniel Torres-Salinas, Wenceslao Arroyo-Machado

The present comparative study examines the three main multidisciplinary bibliographic databases, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and OpenAlex, with the aim of providing up-to-date evidence on coverage, metadata quality, and functional features to help inform strategic decisions in research assessment. The report is structured into two complementary methodological sections. First, it presents a systematic review of recent scholarly literature that investigates record volume, open-access coverage, linguistic diversity, reference coverage, and metadata quality; this is followed by an original bibliometric analysis of the 2015-2024 period that explores longitudinal distribution, document types, thematic profiles, linguistic differences, and overlap between databases. The text concludes with a ten-point executive summary and five recommendations.

### 8. [A2RAG: Adaptive Agentic Graph Retrieval for Cost-Aware and Reliable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21162v1)

Authors: Jiate Liu, Zebin Chen, Shaobo Qiao, Mingchen Ju, Danting Zhang, Bocheng Han, Shuyue Yu, Xin Shu, Jingling Wu, Dong Wen, Xin Cao, Guanfeng Liu, Zhengyi Yang

Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) enhances multihop question answering by organizing corpora into knowledge graphs and routing evidence through relational structure. However, practical deployments face two persistent bottlenecks: (i) mixed-difficulty workloads where one-size-fits-all retrieval either wastes cost on easy queries or fails on hard multihop cases, and (ii) extraction loss, where graph abstraction omits fine-grained qualifiers that remain only in source text. We present A2RAG, an adaptive-and-agentic GraphRAG framework for cost-aware and reliable reasoning. A2RAG couples an adaptive controller that verifies evidence sufficiency and triggers targeted refinement only when necessary, with an agentic retriever that progressively escalates retrieval effort and maps graph signals back to provenance text to remain robust under extraction loss and incomplete graphs. Experiments on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that A2RAG achieves +9.9/+11.8 absolute gains in Recall@2, while cutting token consumption and end-to-end latency by about 50% relative to iterative multihop baselines.

### 9. [Influence Guided Sampling for Domain Adaptation of Text Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21759v1)

Authors: Meet Doshi, Vishwajeet Kumar, Yulong Li, Jaydeep Sen

General-purpose open-domain dense retrieval systems are usually trained with a large, eclectic mix of corpora and search tasks. How should these diverse corpora and tasks be sampled for training? Conventional approaches sample them uniformly, proportional to their instance population sizes, or depend on human-level expert supervision. It is well known that the training data sampling strategy can greatly impact model performance. However, how to find the optimal strategy has not been adequately studied in the context of embedding models. We propose Inf-DDS, a novel reinforcement learning driven sampling framework that adaptively reweighs training datasets guided by influence-based reward signals and is much more lightweight with respect to GPU consumption. Our technique iteratively refines the sampling policy, prioritizing datasets that maximize model performance on a target development set. We evaluate the efficacy of our sampling strategy on a wide range of text retrieval tasks, demonstrating strong improvements in retrieval performance and better adaptation compared to existing gradient-based sampling methods, while also being 1.5x to 4x cheaper in GPU compute. Our sampling strategy achieves a 5.03 absolute NDCG@10 improvement while training a multilingual bge-m3 model and an absolute NDCG@10 improvement of 0.94 while training all-MiniLM-L6-v2, even when starting from expert-assigned weights on a large pool of training datasets.

Authors: Meet Doshi, Aashka Trivedi, Vishwajeet Kumar, Parul Awasthy, Yulong Li, Jaydeep Sen, Radu Florian, Sachindra Joshi

Representation learning is central to many downstream tasks such as search, clustering, classification, and reranking. State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.

Authors: Sami Abuzakuk, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Rishi Sharma, Rasmus Moorits Veski, Martijn de Vos

Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

### 2. [Sampling-Free Privacy Accounting for Matrix Mechanisms under Random Allocation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21636v1)

Authors: Jan Schuchardt, Nikita Kalinin

We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

### 3. [Entropy-Based Dimension-Free Convergence and Loss-Adaptive Schedules for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21943v1)

Authors: Ahmad Aghapour, Erhan Bayraktar, Ziqing Zhang

Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules.

Authors: Xingyue Zhang, Yuxuan Bao, Mars Liyao Gao, J. Nathan Kutz

Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.

### 5. [Learning Hamiltonian Flow Maps: Mean Flow Consistency for Large-Timestep Molecular Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22123v1)

Authors: Winfried Ripken, Michael Plainer, Gregor Lied, Thorben Frank, Oliver T. Unke, Stefan Chmiela, Frank Noé, Klaus Robert Müller

Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.

### 6. [Hebbian Learning with Global Direction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21367v1)

Authors: Wenjia Hua, Kejie Zhao, Luziwei Leng, Ran Cheng, Yuxin Ma, Qinghai Guo

Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

Authors: Zechuan Huang, Zhiguang Cao, Hongshu Guo, Yue-Jiao Gong, Zeyuan Ma

Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

Authors: Amir Ali Farzin, Yuen-Man Pun, Philipp Braun, Tyler Summers, Iman Shames

We consider max-min and min-max problems with objective functions that are possibly non-smooth, submodular with respect to the minimiser and concave with respect to the maximiser. We investigate the performance of a zeroth-order method applied to this problem. The method is based on the subgradient of the Lovász extension of the objective function with respect to the minimiser and based on Gaussian smoothing to estimate the smoothed function gradient with respect to the maximiser. In expectation sense, we prove the convergence of the algorithm to an $ε$-saddle point in the offline case. Moreover, we show that, in the expectation sense, in the online setting, the algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{N\bar{P}_N})$ online duality gap, where $N$ is the number of iterations and $\bar{P}_N$ is the path length of the sequence of optimal decisions. The complexity analysis and hyperparameter selection are presented for all the cases. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical examples.

### 9. [Hardware-Triggered Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21902v1)

Authors: Jonas Möller, Erik Imgrund, Thorsten Eisenhofer, Konrad Rieck

Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat.

### 10. [A Low-Complexity Plug-and-Play Deep Learning Model for Generalizable Massive MIMO Precoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21897v1)

Authors: Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan, Ahmed Ibrahim, Jean-François Frigon, François Leduc-Primeau

Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink precoding offers high spectral efficiency but remains challenging to deploy in practice because near-optimal algorithms such as the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) are computationally expensive, and sensitive to SNR and channel-estimation quality, while existing deep learning (DL)-based solutions often lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment site. This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples. Across both architectures, PaPP achieves more than 21$\times$ reduction in modeled computation energy and maintains good performance under channel-estimation errors, making it a practical solution for energy-efficient mMIMO precoding.

### 1. [NEXUS: Bit-Exact ANN-to-SNN Equivalence via Neuromorphic Gate Circuits with Surrogate-Free Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21279v1)

Authors: Zhengzheng Tang

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient computing through event-driven sparsity, yet all existing approaches sacrifice accuracy by approximating continuous values with discrete spikes. We propose NEXUS, a framework that achieves bit-exact ANN-to-SNN equivalence -- not approximate, but mathematically identical outputs. Our key insight is constructing all arithmetic operations, both linear and nonlinear, from pure IF neuron logic gates that implement IEEE-754 compliant floating-point arithmetic. Through spatial bit encoding (zero encoding error by construction), hierarchical neuromorphic gate circuits (from basic logic gates to complete transformer layers), and surrogate-free STE training (exact identity mapping rather than heuristic approximation), NEXUS produces outputs identical to standard ANNs up to machine precision. Experiments on models up to LLaMA-2 70B demonstrate identical task accuracy (0.00\% degradation) with mean ULP error of only 6.19, while achieving 27-168,000$\times$ energy reduction on neuromorphic hardware. Crucially, spatial bit encoding's single-timestep design renders the framework inherently immune to membrane potential leakage (100\% accuracy across all decay factors $β\in[0.1,1.0]$), while tolerating synaptic noise up to $σ=0.2$ with >98\% gate-level accuracy.

Authors: Junhong Cai, Guiqin Wang, Kejie Zhao, Jianxiong Tang, Xiang Wang, Luziwei Leng, Ran Cheng, Yuxin Ma, Qinghai Guo

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse domains but suffer from high energy costs due to quadratic attention and dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) operations. To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR effectively restores the performance of its dense counterpart under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption. Furthermore, it outperforms efficient models of comparable or even larger scale, underscoring its potential for building efficient and practical LLMs.

Authors: Baiyu Chen, Yujie Wu, Siyuan Xu, Peng Qu, Dehua Wu, Xu Chu, Haodong Bian, Shuo Zhang, Bo Xu, Youhui Zhang, Zhengyu Ma, Guoqi Li

Neuroscience and artificial intelligence represent distinct yet complementary pathways to general intelligence. However, amid the ongoing boom in AI research and applications, the translational synergy between these two fields has grown increasingly elusive-hampered by a widening infrastructural incompatibility: modern AI frameworks lack native support for biophysical realism, while neural simulation tools are poorly suited for gradient-based optimization and neuromorphic hardware deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce BrainFuse, a unified infrastructure that provides comprehensive support for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning. By addressing algorithmic, computational, and deployment challenges, BrainFuse exhibits three core capabilities: (1) algorithmic integration of detailed neuronal dynamics into a differentiable learning framework; (2) system-level optimization that accelerates customizable ion-channel dynamics by up to 3,000x on GPUs; and (3) scalable computation with highly compatible pipelines for neuromorphic hardware deployment. We demonstrate this full-stack design through both AI and neuroscience tasks, from foundational neuron simulation and functional cylinder modeling to real-world deployment and application scenarios. For neuroscience, BrainFuse supports multiscale biological modeling, enabling the deployment of approximately 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with 100 million synapses on a single neuromorphic chip while consuming as low as 1.98 W. For AI, BrainFuse facilitates the synergistic application of realistic biological neuron models, demonstrating enhanced robustness to input noise and improved temporal processing endowed by complex HH dynamics. BrainFuse therefore serves as a foundational engine to facilitate cross-disciplinary research and accelerate the development of next-generation bio-inspired intelligent systems.

### 4. [Adaptive Surrogate-Based Strategy for Accelerating Convergence Speed when Solving Expensive Unconstrained Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21885v1)

Authors: Tiwonge Msulira Banda, Alexandru-Ciprian Zăvoianu

Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have proven effective at solving Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems (MOOPs). However, their performance can be significantly hindered when applied to computationally intensive industrial problems. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive surrogate modelling approach designed to accelerate the early-stage convergence speed of state-of-the-art MOEAs. This is important because it ensures that a solver can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions with relatively few fitness function evaluations, thereby saving both time and computational resources. Our method employs a two-loop architecture. The outer loop runs a (baseline) host MOEA which carries out true fitness evaluations. The inner loop contains an Adaptive Accelerator that leverages data-driven machine learning (ML) surrogate models to approximate fitness functions. Integrated with NSGA-II and MOEA/D, our approach was tested on 31 widely known benchmark problems and a real-world North Sea fish abundance modelling case study. The results demonstrate that by incorporating Gaussian Process Regression, one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks, and Random Forest Regression, our proposed approach significantly accelerates the convergence speed of MOEAs in the early phases of optimisation.

Authors: Zihan Huang, Zijie Xu, Yihan Huang, Shanshan Jia, Tong Bu, Yiting Dong, Wenxuan Liu, Jianhao Ding, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly energy-efficient due to event-driven, sparse computation, but their training is challenged by spike non-differentiability and trade-offs among performance, efficiency, and biological plausibility. Crucially, mainstream SNNs ignore predictive coding, a core cortical mechanism where the brain predicts inputs and encodes errors for efficient perception. Inspired by this, we propose a self-prediction enhanced spiking neuron method that generates an internal prediction current from its input-output history to modulate membrane potential. This design offers dual advantages, it creates a continuous gradient path that alleviates vanishing gradients and boosts training stability and accuracy, while also aligning with biological principles, which resembles distal dendritic modulation and error-driven synaptic plasticity. Experiments show consistent performance gains across diverse architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks demonstrating broad applicability for enhancing SNNs.

### 6. [Error Amplification Limits ANN-to-SNN Conversion in Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21778v1)

Authors: Zijie Xu, Zihan Huang, Yiting Dong, Kang Chen, Wenxuan Liu, Zhaofei Yu

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can achieve competitive performance by converting already existing well-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), avoiding further costly training. This property is particularly attractive in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where training through environment interaction is expensive and potentially unsafe. However, existing conversion methods perform poorly in continuous control, where suitable baselines are largely absent. We identify error amplification as the key cause: small action approximation errors become temporally correlated across decision steps, inducing cumulative state distribution shift and severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free mechanism that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress temporally correlated errors. Experiments on continuous control benchmarks with both vector and visual observations demonstrate that CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines and substantially recovers lost performance. Our results highlight continuous control as a critical and challenging benchmark for ANN-to-SNN conversion, where small errors can be strongly amplified and impact performance.

Authors: Kirill Antonov, Teus Tukker, Tiago Botari, Thomas H. W. Bäck, Anna V. Kononova, Niki van Stein

Designing high-performance optical lenses entails exploring a high-dimensional, tightly constrained space of surface curvatures, glass choices, element thicknesses, and spacings. In practice, standard optimizers (e.g., gradient-based local search and evolutionary strategies) often converge to a single local optimum, overlooking many comparably good alternatives that matter for downstream engineering decisions. We propose the Lens Descriptor-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (LDG-EA), a two-stage framework for multimodal lens optimization. LDG-EA first partitions the design space into behavior descriptors defined by curvature-sign patterns and material indices, then learns a probabilistic model over descriptors to allocate evaluations toward promising regions. Within each descriptor, LDG-EA applies the Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm with covariance-matrix self-adaptation to recover multiple distinct local minima, optionally followed by gradient-based refinement. On a 24-variable (18 continuous and 6 integer), six-element Double-Gauss topology, LDG-EA generates on average around 14500 candidate minima spanning 636 unique descriptors, an order of magnitude more than a CMA-ES baseline, while keeping wall-clock time at one hour scale. Although the best LDG-EA design is slightly worse than a fine-tuned reference lens, it remains in the same performance range. Overall, the proposed LDG-EA produces a diverse set of solutions while maintaining competitive quality within practical computational budgets and wall-clock time.

### 9. [Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation: Aligning Language Models Without Ground-Truth Labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21268v1)

Authors: Micah Rentschler, Jesse Roberts

Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods for training large language models (LLMs) require ground-truth labels or task-specific verifiers, limiting scalability when correctness is ambiguous or expensive to obtain. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation (RLME), which optimizes a generator using reward derived from an evaluator's answers to natural-language meta-questions (e.g., "Is the answer correct?" or "Is the reasoning logically consistent?"). RLME treats the evaluator's probability of a positive judgment as a reward and updates the generator via group-relative policy optimization, enabling learning without labels. Across a suite of experiments, we show that RLME achieves accuracy and sample efficiency comparable to label-based training, enables controllable trade-offs among multiple objectives, steers models toward reliable reasoning patterns rather than post-hoc rationalization, and generalizes to open-domain settings where ground-truth labels are unavailable, broadening the domains in which LLMs may be trained with RL.

Authors: Qingshan Wang, Clara C. Wanjura, Florian Marquardt

The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

### 1. [ViTMAlis: Towards Latency-Critical Mobile Video Analytics with Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21362v1)

Authors: Miao Zhang, Guanzhen Wu, Hao Fang, Yifei Zhu, Fangxin Wang, Ruixiao Zhang, Jiangchuan Liu

Edge-assisted mobile video analytics (MVA) applications are increasingly shifting from using vision models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to those built on vision transformers (ViTs) to leverage their superior global context modeling and generalization capabilities. However, deploying these advanced models in latency-critical MVA scenarios presents significant challenges. Unlike traditional CNN-based offloading paradigms where network transmission is the primary bottleneck, ViT-based systems are constrained by substantial inference delays, particularly for dense prediction tasks where the need for high-resolution inputs exacerbates the inherent quadratic computational complexity of ViTs. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic mixed-resolution inference strategy tailored for ViT-backboned dense prediction models, enabling flexible runtime trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Building on this, we introduce ViTMAlis, a ViT-native device-to-edge offloading framework that dynamically adapts to network conditions and video content to jointly reduce transmission and inference delays. We implement a fully functional prototype of ViTMAlis on commodity mobile and edge devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-centric, content-aware, and latency-adaptive baselines, ViTMAlis significantly reduces end-to-end offloading latency while improving user-perceived rendering accuracy, providing a practical foundation for next-generation mobile intelligence.

Authors: Ankita Koley, Anu Krishna, Chandramani Singh, V Mahendran

We consider a Sensing-as-a-Service (S2aaS) system consisting of a sensor, a set of users, and a sensor cloud service provider (SCSP). The sensor updates its content each time it captures a new measurement. The SCSP occasionally fetches the content from the sensor, caches the latest fetched version and broadcasts it on being requested by the users. The SCSP incurs content fetching costs while fetching and broadcasting the contents. The SCSP also incurs an age cost if users do not receive the most recent version of the content after requesting. We study a content fetching and broadcast problem, aiming to minimize the time-averaged content fetching and age costs. The problem can be framed as a Markov decision process but cannot be elegantly solved owing to its multi-dimensional state space and complex dynamics. To address this, we first obtain the optimal policy for the homogeneous case with all the users having the same request probability and age cost. We extend this algorithm for heterogeneous case but the complexity grows exponentially with the number of users. To tackle this, we propose a low complexity Whittle index based algorithm, which performs very close to the optimal. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in number of users and serves as a heuristic for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases.

Authors: MohammadErfan Jabbari, Abhishek Duttagupta, Claudio Fiandrino, Leonardo Bonati, Salvatore D'Oro, Michele Polese, Marco Fiore, Tommaso Melodia

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) promises adaptive control for future mobile networks but conventional agents remain reactive: they act on past and current measurements and cannot leverage short-term forecasts of exogenous KPIs such as bandwidth. Augmenting agents with predictions can overcome this temporal myopia, yet uptake in networking is scarce because forecast-aware agents act as closed-boxes; operators cannot tell whether predictions guide decisions or justify the added complexity. We propose SIA, the first interpreter that exposes in real time how forecast-augmented DRL agents operate. SIA fuses Symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI Knowledge Graphs to produce explanations, and includes a new Influence Score metric. SIA achieves sub-millisecond speed, over 200x faster than existing XAI methods. We evaluate SIA on three diverse networking use cases, uncovering hidden issues, including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward-design biases that trigger counter-productive policies. These insights enable targeted fixes: a redesigned agent achieves a 9% higher average bitrate in video streaming, and SIA's online Action-Refinement module improves RAN-slicing reward by 25% without retraining. By making anticipatory DRL transparent and tunable, SIA lowers the barrier to proactive control in next-generation mobile networks.

We explore how command stack protection requirements outlined in NASA-STD-1006A can be satisfied within the context of emergency space telemetry. Proposed implementation of lightweight authenticated encryption offers strong security without sacrificing performance in resource-constrained environments. It produces fixed-length messages, maintaining compatibility with the underlying data transport protocols. By focusing on predictable properties and robust authentication, we create a scheme that protects the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of telemetry data in emergency communications while balancing security requirements with the operational constraints.

This paper addresses the critical challenge of coordinating mobile edge UAV networks to maintain robust service in highly dynamic spatiotemporal environments. Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when transitioning between distinct task scenarios, such as moving from dense urban clusters to sparse rural areas. These transitions typically necessitate computationally expensive retraining or model resets to adapt to new user distributions, leading to service interruptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a computationally efficient Spatiotemporal Continual Learning (STCL) framework realized through a Group-Decoupled Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (G-MAPPO) algorithm. Our approach integrates a novel Group-Decoupled Policy Optimization (GDPO) mechanism that utilizes dynamic $z$-score normalization to autonomously balance heterogeneous objectives, including energy efficiency, user fairness, and coverage. This mechanism effectively mitigates gradient conflicts induced by concept drifts without requiring offline retraining. Furthermore, the framework leverages the 3D mobility of UAVs as a spatial compensation layer, enabling the swarm to autonomously adjust altitudes to accommodate extreme density fluctuations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed STCL framework achieves superior resilience, characterized by an elastic recovery of service reliability to approximately 0.95 during phase transitions. Compared to the MADDPG baseline, G-MAPPO not only prevents knowledge forgetting but also delivers an effective capacity gain of 20\% under extreme traffic loads, validating its potential as a scalable solution for edge-enabled aerial swarms.

Authors: Zhiyuan Zhao, Jiasheng Wu, Shaojie Su, Wenjun Zhu, Yue Gao

Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites play a pivotal role in global connectivity-delivering high-speed Internet, cellular coverage, and massive IoT support. With ever-growing onboard computing and storage resources, LEO satellites herald a new cloud paradigm: space cloud computing. While container or chestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) excel in terrestrial data centers, they are ill-suited to LEO satellite networks, featuring geographic dispersion and frequent handovers. Those features bring high latency and intermittent management, leading to control plane failure in container orchestration. To address this, we propose KubeSpace, a low-latency and stable control plane specifically designed for container orchestration on LEO satellites. KubeSpace combines two key innovations: a distributed ground-control-node architecture that binds each satellite to its nearest controller for uninterrupted management, and an orbit-aware placement with dynamic assignment strategy that further minimizes communication latency and handover frequency. Extensive experiments based on real satellite traces demonstrate that compared to existing solutions, KubeSpace reduces the average management latency of satellite nodes by 59% without any management interruption time.

Authors: Abhishek Duttagupta, MohammadErfan Jabbari, Claudio Fiandrino, Marco Fiore, Joerg Widmer

The operation of future 6th-generation (6G) mobile networks will increasingly rely on the ability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize network decisions in real-time. DRL yields demonstrated efficacy in various resource allocation problems, such as joint decisions on user scheduling and antenna allocation or simultaneous control of computing resources and modulation. However, trained DRL agents are closed-boxes and inherently difficult to explain, which hinders their adoption in production settings. In this paper, we make a step towards removing this critical barrier by presenting SymbXRL, a novel technique for explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) that synthesizes human-interpretable explanations for DRL agents. SymbXRL leverages symbolic AI to produce explanations where key concepts and their relationships are described via intuitive symbols and rules; coupling such a representation with logical reasoning exposes the decision process of DRL agents and offers more comprehensible descriptions of their behaviors compared to existing approaches. We validate SymbXRL in practical network management use cases supported by DRL, proving that it not only improves the semantics of the explanations but also paves the way for explicit agent control: for instance, it enables intent-based programmatic action steering that improves by 12% the median cumulative reward over a pure DRL solution.

### 8. [Self-Adaptive Probabilistic Skyline Query Processing in Distributed Edge Computing via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21855v1)

Authors: Chuan-Chi Lai

In the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), the exponential growth of sensor-generated data at the network edge renders efficient Probabilistic Skyline Query (PSKY) processing a critical challenge. Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\% in communication overhead and 40\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.

### 1. [Multi-Modular MANTA-RAY: A Modular Soft Surface Platform for Distributed Multi-Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21884v1)

Authors: Pratik Ingle, Jørn Lambertsen, Kasper Støy, Andres Faina

Manipulation surfaces control objects by actively deforming their shape rather than directly grasping them. While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications.

Authors: Jinhao Zhang, Wenlong Xia, Yaojia Wang, Zhexuan Zhou, Huizhe Li, Yichen Lai, Haoming Song, Youmin Gong, Jie Me

Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.

Authors: Zeyi Liu, Shuang Liu, Jihai Min, Zhaoheng Zhang, Jun Cen, Pengyu Han, Songqiao Hu, Zihan Meng, Xiao He, Donghua Zhou

With the rapid development of industrial intelligence and unmanned inspection, reliable perception and safety assessment for AI systems in complex and dynamic industrial sites has become a key bottleneck for deploying predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection. Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances. For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments.

Authors: Jianli Sun, Bin Tian, Qiyao Zhang, Chengxiang Li, Zihan Song, Zhiyong Cui, Yisheng Lv, Yonglin Tian

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in ground-based embodied intelligence, their application to Aerial Manipulation Systems (AMS) remains a largely unexplored frontier. The inherent characteristics of AMS, including floating-base dynamics, strong coupling between the UAV and the manipulator, and the multi-step, long-horizon nature of operational tasks, pose severe challenges to existing VLA paradigms designed for static or 2D mobile bases. To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models. Our experiments not only validate the feasibility of transferring VLA paradigms to aerial systems but also, through multi-dimensional metrics tailored to aerial tasks, reveal the capabilities and boundaries of current models regarding UAV mobility, manipulator control, and high-level planning. AIR-VLA establishes a standardized testbed and data foundation for future research in general-purpose aerial robotics. The resource of AIR-VLA will be available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AIR-VLA-dataset-B5CC/.

Authors: Carmen D. R. Pita-Romero, Pedro Arias-Perez, Miguel Fernandez-Cortizas, Rafael Perez-Segui, Pascual Campoy

Maintaining the formation of complex structures with multiple UAVs and achieving complex trajectories remains a major challenge. This work presents an algorithm for implementing the flocking behavior of UAVs based on the concept of Virtual Centroid to easily develop a structure for the flock. The approach builds on the classical virtual-based behavior, providing a theoretical framework for incorporating enhancements to dynamically control both the number of agents and the formation of the structure. Simulation tests and real-world experiments were conducted, demonstrating its simplicity even with complex formations and complex trajectories.

### 6. [DexTac: Learning Contact-aware Visuotactile Policies via Hand-by-hand Teaching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21474v1)

Authors: Xingyu Zhang, Chaofan Zhang, Boyue Zhang, Zhinan Peng, Shaowei Cui, Shuo Wang

For contact-intensive tasks, the ability to generate policies that produce comprehensive tactile-aware motions is essential. However, existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation often suffer from low-dimensional tactile information. To address this limitation, we propose DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework based on kinesthetic teaching. DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%. These results underscore that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.

### 7. [Spotlighting Task-Relevant Features: Object-Centric Representations for Better Generalization in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21416v1)

Authors: Alexandre Chapin, Bruno Machado, Emmanuel Dellandréa, Liming Chen

The generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies are heavily influenced by the choice of visual representations. Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.

### 8. [Singularity-Free Lie Group Integration and Geometrically Consistent Evaluation of Multibody System Models Described in Terms of Standard Absolute Coordinates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21413v1)

Authors: Andreas Mueller

A classical approach to the multibody systems (MBS) modeling is to use absolute coordinates, i.e., a set of (possibly redundant) coordinates that describe the absolute position and orientation of the individual bodies with respect to an inertial frame (IFR). A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations.

### 9. [Disentangling perception and reasoning for improving data efficiency in learning cloth manipulation without demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21713v1)

Authors: Donatien Delehelle, Fei Chen, Darwin Caldwell

Cloth manipulation is a ubiquitous task in everyday life, but it remains an open challenge for robotics. The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.

### 10. [Abstracting Robot Manipulation Skills via Mixture-of-Experts Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21251v1)

Authors: Ce Hao, Xuanran Zhai, Yaohua Liu, Harold Soh

Diffusion-based policies have recently shown strong results in robot manipulation, but their extension to multi-task scenarios is hindered by the high cost of scaling model size and demonstrations. We introduce Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a diffusion-based mixture-of-experts policy that learns a compact orthogonal skill basis and uses sticky routing to compose actions from a small, task-relevant subset of experts at each step. A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines. These results indicate a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change.

Authors: Adriana Novoa-Hurtado, Rubén Saborido, Francisco Chicano, Manuel Giménez-Medina

Clear and concise code is necessary to ensure maintainability, so it is crucial that the software is as simple as possible to understand, to avoid bugs and, above all, vulnerabilities. There are many ways to enhance software without changing its functionality, considering the extract method refactoring the primary process to reduce the effort required for code comprehension. The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods. We propose a multi-objective integer linear programming model to obtain a set of solutions that reduce the cognitive complexity of a given piece of code, such as balancing the number of lines of code and its cognitive complexity. In addition, several algorithms have been developed to validate the model. These algorithms have been integrated into a tool that enables the parameterised resolution of the problem of reducing software cognitive complexity.

Authors: Alireza Nadaf, Alireza Mohammadshahi, Majid Yazdani

We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

Authors: Mark Looi, Julianne Quinn

The rapid advance of Generative AI into software development prompts this empirical investigation of perceptual effects on practice. We study the usage patterns of 147 professional developers, examining perceived correlates of AI tools use, the resulting productivity and quality outcomes, and developer readiness for emerging AI-enhanced development. We describe a virtuous adoption cycle where frequent and broad AI tools use are the strongest correlates of both Perceived Productivity (PP) and quality, with frequency strongest. The study finds no perceptual support for the Quality Paradox and shows that PP is positively correlated with Perceived Code Quality (PQ) improvement. Developers thus report both productivity and quality gains. High current usage, breadth of application, frequent use of AI tools for testing, and ease of use correlate strongly with future intended adoption, though security concerns remain a moderate and statistically significant barrier to adoption. Moreover, AI testing tools' adoption lags that of coding tools, opening a Testing Gap. We identify three developer archetypes (Enthusiasts, Pragmatists, Cautious) that align with an innovation diffusion process wherein the virtuous adoption cycle serves as the individual engine of progression. Our findings reveal that organizational adoption of AI tools follows such a process: Enthusiasts push ahead with tools, creating organizational success that converts Pragmatists. The Cautious are held in organizational stasis: without early adopter examples, they don't enter the virtuous adoption cycle, never accumulate the usage frequency that drives intent, and never attain high efficacy. Policy itself does not predict individuals' intent to increase usage but functions as a marker of maturity, formalizing the successful diffusion of adoption by Enthusiasts while acting as a gateway that the Cautious group has yet to reach.

### 4. [Liquid Interfaces: A Dynamic Ontology for the Interoperability of Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21993v1)

Authors: Dhiogo de Sá, Carlos Schmiedel, Carlos Pereira Lopes

Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems

### 5. [The Energy Impact of Domain Model Design in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21967v1)

Authors: Ilche Georgievski, Serhat Tekin, Marco Aiello

AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

Authors: Sayma Sultana, London Cavaletto, Bianca Trinkenreich, Amiangshu Bosu

While systemic workplace bias is well-documented in non-computing fields, its specific impact on software engineers remains poorly understood. This study addresses that gap by applying Social Identity Theory (SIT) to investigate four distinct forms of bias: lack of career development, stereotyped task selection, unwelcoming environments, and identity attacks. Using a vignette-based survey, we quantified the prevalence of these biases, identified the demographics most affected, assessed their consequences, and explored the motivations behind biased actions. Our results show that career development and task selection biases are the most prevalent forms, with over two-thirds of victims experiencing them multiple times. Women were more than three times as likely as men to face career development bias, task selection bias, and an unwelcoming environment. In parallel, individuals from marginalized ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately targeted by identity attacks. Our analysis also confirms that, beyond gender and race, factors such as age, years of experience, organization size, and geographic location are significant predictors of bias victimization.

Authors: Esteban Parra, Sonia Haiduc, Preetha Chatterjee, Ramtin Ehsani, Polina Iaremchuk

Peer review is the main mechanism by which the software engineering community assesses the quality of scientific results. However, the rapid growth of paper submissions in software engineering venues has outpaced the availability of qualified reviewers, creating a growing imbalance that risks constraining and negatively impacting the long-term growth of the Software Engineering (SE) research community. Our vision of the Future of the SE research landscape involves a more scalable, inclusive, and resilient peer review process that incorporates additional mechanisms for: 1) attracting and training newcomers to serve as high-quality reviewers, 2) incentivizing more community members to serve as peer reviewers, and 3) cautiously integrating AI tools to support a high-quality review process.

### 8. [A costing framework for fusion power plants](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21724v1)

Authors: Simon Woodruff

This paper summarizes and consolidates fusion power-plant costing work performed in support of ARPA-E from 2017 through 2024, and documents the evolution of the associated analysis framework from early capital-cost-focused studies to a standards-aligned, auditable costing capability. Early efforts applied ARIES-style cost-scaling relations to generate Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) estimates and were calibrated through a pilot study with Bechtel and Decysive Systems to benchmark balance-of-plant (BOP) costs and validate plant-level reasonableness from an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) perspective. Subsequent work, informed by Lucid Catalyst studies of nuclear cost drivers, expanded the methodology to treat indirect costs explicitly and to evaluate cost-reduction pathways for non-fusion-island systems through design-for-cost practices, modularization, centralized manufacturing, and learning. As ARPA-E's fusion portfolio expanded, these methods were applied across BETHE and GAMOW concepts (and select ALPHA revisits), including enhanced treatment of tritium handling and plant integration supported by Princeton/PPPL expertise. In 2023 the capability was refactored to align with the IAEA-GEN-IV EMWG-EPRI code-of-accounts lineage, while key ARIES-derived scaling relations were replaced by bottom-up subsystem models for dominant fusion cost drivers (e.g., magnets, lasers, power supplies, and power-core components) coupled to physics-informed power balances and engineering-constrained radial builds. These developments were implemented in the spreadsheet-based Fusion Economics code (FECONs) and released as an open-source Python framework (pyFECONs), providing a transparent mapping from subsystem estimates to standardized accounts and a consistent computation of LCOE.

Authors: Hassam Tahir, Faizan Faisal, Fady Alnajjar, Muhammad Imran Taj, Lucia Gordon, Aila Khan, Michael Lwin, Omar Mubin

This paper presents a framework for integrating LLM into collaborative learning platforms to enhance student engagement, critical thinking, and inclusivity. The framework employs advanced LLMs as dynamic moderators to facilitate real-time discussions and adapt to learners' evolving needs, ensuring diverse and inclusive educational experiences. Key innovations include robust feedback mechanisms that refine AI moderation, promote reflective learning, and balance participation among users. The system's modular architecture featuring ReactJS for the frontend, Flask for backend operations, and efficient question retrieval supports personalized and engaging interactions through dynamic adjustments to prompts and discussion flows. Testing demonstrates that the framework significantly improves student collaboration, fosters deeper comprehension, and scales effectively across various subjects and user groups. By addressing limitations in static moderation and personalization in existing systems, this work establishes a strong foundation for next-generation AI-driven educational tools, advancing equitable and impactful learning outcomes.

### 10. [Assessing the Business Process Modeling Competences of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21787v1)

Authors: Chantale Lauer, Peter Pfeiffer, Alexander Rombach, Nijat Mehdiyev

The creation of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models is a complex and time-consuming task requiring both domain knowledge and proficiency in modeling conventions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.

Authors: Md Samsur Rahaman, Supriyo Dutta

In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solve this problem uses the classical random walks on the graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our procedure of community detection on a number of graphs and social networks, such as the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, dolphin's social network, etc.

Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.

### 3. [Opinion Consensus Formation Among Networked Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21540v1)

Authors: Iris Yazici, Mert Kayaalp, Stefan Taga, Ali H. Sayed

Can classical consensus models predict the group behavior of large language models (LLMs)? We examine multi-round interactions among LLM agents through the DeGroot framework, where agents exchange text-based messages over diverse communication graphs. To track opinion evolution, we map each message to an opinion score via sentiment analysis. We find that agents typically reach consensus and the disagreement between the agents decays exponentially. However, the limiting opinion departs from DeGroot's network-centrality-weighted forecast. The consensus between LLM agents turns out to be largely insensitive to initial conditions and instead depends strongly on the discussion subject and inherent biases. Nevertheless, transient dynamics align with classical graph theory and the convergence rate of opinions is closely related to the second-largest eigenvalue of the graph's combination matrix. Together, these findings can be useful for LLM-driven social-network simulations and the design of resource-efficient multi-agent LLM applications.

### 4. [Industrialized Deception: The Collateral Effects of LLM-Generated Misinformation on Digital Ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21963v1)

Authors: Alexander Loth, Martin Kappes, Marc-Oliver Pahl

Generative AI and misinformation research has evolved since our 2024 survey. This paper presents an updated perspective, transitioning from literature review to practical countermeasures. We report on changes in the threat landscape, including improved AI-generated content through Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal systems. Central to this work are our practical contributions: JudgeGPT, a platform for evaluating human perception of AI-generated news, and RogueGPT, a controlled stimulus generation engine for research. Together, these tools form an experimental pipeline for studying how humans perceive and detect AI-generated misinformation. Our findings show that detection capabilities have improved, but the competition between generation and detection continues. We discuss mitigation strategies including LLM-based detection, inoculation approaches, and the dual-use nature of generative AI. This work contributes to research addressing the adverse impacts of AI on information quality.

### 5. [Moral Outrage Shapes Commitments Beyond Attention: Multimodal Moral Emotions on YouTube in Korea and the US](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21815v1)

Authors: Seongchan Park, Jaehong Kim, Hyeonseung Kim, Heejin Bin, Sue Moon, Wonjae Lee

Understanding how media rhetoric shapes audience engagement is crucial in the attention economy. This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers.

Authors: Xinyi Zhang, Mamtaj Akter, Heajun An, Minqian Liu, Qi Zhang, Lifu Huang, Jin-Hee Cho, Pamela J. Wisniewski, Sang Won Lee

Cybergrooming is a form of online abuse that threatens teens' mental health and physical safety. Yet, most prior work has focused on detecting perpetrators' behaviors, leaving a limited understanding of how teens might respond to such unwanted advances. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey with 74 participants -- 51 parents and 23 teens -- who responded to simulated cybergrooming scenarios in two ways: responses that they think would make teens more vulnerable or resilient to unwanted sexual advances. Through a mixed-methods analysis, we identified four types of vulnerable responses (encouraging escalation, accepting an advance, displaying vulnerability, and negating risk concern) and four types of protective strategies (setting boundaries, directly declining, signaling risk awareness, and leveraging avoidance techniques). As the cybergrooming risk escalated, both vulnerable responses and protective strategies showed a corresponding progression. This study contributes a teen-centered understanding of cybergrooming, a labeled dataset, and a stage-based taxonomy of perceived protective strategies, while offering implications for educational programs and sociotechnical interventions.

Authors: Anders Gjølbye, Ida Kargaard, Emma Kargaard, Lars Kai Hansen

Partial Least Squares (PLS) learns shared structure from paired data via the top singular vectors of the empirical cross-covariance (PLS-SVD), but multimodal datasets often have missing entries in both views. We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.

### 2. [Differential Dynamic Causal Nets: Model Construction, Identification and Group Comparisons](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21478v1)

Authors: Kang You, Gary Green, Jian Zhang

Pathophysiolpgical modelling of brain systems from microscale to macroscale remains difficult in group comparisons partly because of the infeasibility of modelling the interactions of thousands of neurons at the scales involved. Here, to address the challenge, we present a novel approach to construct differential causal networks directly from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed network is based on conditionally coupled neuronal circuits which describe the average behaviour of interacting neuron populations that contribute to observed EEG data. In the network, each node represents a parameterised local neural system while directed edges stand for node-wise connections with transmission parameters. The network is hierarchically structured in the sense that node and edge parameters are varying in subjects but follow a mixed-effects model. A novel evolutionary optimisation algorithm for parameter inference in the proposed method is developed using a loss function derived from Chen-Fliess expansions of stochastic differential equations. The method is demonstrated by application to the fitting of coupled Jansen-Rit local models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real EEG data. In the real EEG data analysis, we track changes in the parameters that characterise dynamic causality within brains that demonstrate epileptic activity. We show evidence of network functional disruptions, due to imbalance of excitatory-inhibitory interneurons and altered epileptic brain connectivity, before and during seizure periods.

### 3. [Partial Feedback Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21462v1)

Authors: Shihao Shao, Cong Fang, Zhouchen Lin, Dacheng Tao

We study partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of correct labels, but the learner only observes one correct label per round; any prediction within the correct set is counted as correct. This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.

### 4. [Generative Modeling of Discrete Data Using Geometric Latent Subspaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21831v1)

Authors: Daniel Gonzalez-Alvarado, Jonas Cassel, Stefania Petra, Christoph Schnörr

We introduce the use of latent subspaces in the exponential parameter space of product manifolds of categorial distributions, as a tool for learning generative models of discrete data. The low-dimensional latent space encodes statistical dependencies and removes redundant degrees of freedom among the categorial variables. We equip the parameter domain with a Riemannian geometry such that the spaces and distances are related by isometries which enables consistent flow matching. In particular, geodesics become straight lines which makes model training by flow matching effective. Empirical results demonstrate that reduced latent dimensions suffice to represent data for generative modeling.

### 5. [Mean-field Variational Bayes for Sparse Probit Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21765v1)

Authors: Augusto Fasano, Giovanni Rebaudo

We consider Bayesian variable selection for binary outcomes under a probit link with a spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients. Motivated by the computational challenges encountered by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers in high-dimensional regimes, we develop a mean-field variational Bayes approximation in which all variational factors admit closed-form updates, and the evidence lower bound is available in closed form. This, in turn, allows the development of an efficient coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm to find the optimal values of the variational parameters. The approach produces posterior inclusion probabilities and parameter estimates, enabling interpretable selection and prediction within a single framework. As shown in both simulated and real data applications, the proposed method successfully identifies the important variables and is orders of magnitude faster than MCMC, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

### 6. [Efficient Stochastic Optimisation via Sequential Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22003v1)

Authors: James Cuin, Davide Carbone, Yanbo Tang, O. Deniz Akyildiz

The problem of optimising functions with intractable gradients frequently arise in machine learning and statistics, ranging from maximum marginal likelihood estimation procedures to fine-tuning of generative models. Stochastic approximation methods for this class of problems typically require inner sampling loops to obtain (biased) stochastic gradient estimates, which rapidly becomes computationally expensive. In this work, we develop sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers for optimisation of functions with intractable gradients. Our approach replaces expensive inner sampling methods with efficient SMC approximations, which can result in significant computational gains. We establish convergence results for the basic recursions defined by our methodology which SMC samplers approximate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the reward-tuning of energy-based models within various settings.

### 7. [Diffusion Path Samplers via Sequential Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21951v1)

Authors: James Matthew Young, Paula Cordero-Encinar, Sebastian Reich, Andrew Duncan, O. Deniz Akyildiz

We develop a diffusion-based sampler for target distributions known up to a normalising constant. To this end, we rely on the well-known diffusion path that smoothly interpolates between a (simple) base distribution and the target distribution, widely used in diffusion models. Our approach is based on a practical implementation of diffusion-annealed Langevin Monte Carlo, which approximates the diffusion path with convergence guarantees. We tackle the score estimation problem by developing an efficient sequential Monte Carlo sampler that evolves auxiliary variables from conditional distributions along the path, which provides principled score estimates for time-varying distributions. We further develop novel control variate schedules that minimise the variance of these score estimates. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several synthetic and real-world datasets.

### 8. [VSE: Variational state estimation of complex model-free process](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21887v1)

Authors: Gustav Norén, Anubhab Ghosh, Fredrik Cumlin, Saikat Chatterjee

We design a variational state estimation (VSE) method that provides a closed-form Gaussian posterior of an underlying complex dynamical process from (noisy) nonlinear measurements. The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model. The VSE is shown to be competitive against a particle filter that knows the Lorenz system model and a recently proposed data-driven state estimation method that does not know the Lorenz system model.

### 9. [Sampling-Free Privacy Accounting for Matrix Mechanisms under Random Allocation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21636v1)

Authors: Jan Schuchardt, Nikita Kalinin

We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

### 10. [A Flexible Empirical Bayes Approach to Generalized Linear Models, with Applications to Sparse Logistic Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21217v1)

Authors: Dongyue Xie, Wanrong Zhu, Matthew Stephens

We introduce a flexible empirical Bayes approach for fitting Bayesian generalized linear models. Specifically, we adopt a novel mean-field variational inference (VI) method and the prior is estimated within the VI algorithm, making the method tuning-free. Unlike traditional VI methods that optimize the posterior density function, our approach directly optimizes the posterior mean and prior parameters. This formulation reduces the number of parameters to optimize and enables the use of scalable algorithms such as L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, our method automatically determines the optimal posterior based on the prior and likelihood, distinguishing it from existing VI methods that often assume a Gaussian variational. Our approach represents a unified framework applicable to a wide range of exponential family distributions, removing the need to develop unique VI methods for each combination of likelihood and prior distributions. We apply the framework to solve sparse logistic regression and demonstrate the superior predictive performance of our method in extensive numerical studies, by comparing it to prevalent sparse logistic regression approaches.

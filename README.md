### 1. [Falcon-H1R: Pushing the Reasoning Frontiers with a Hybrid Model for Efficient Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02346v1)

Authors: Falcon LLM Team, Iheb Chaabane, Puneesh Khanna, Suhail Mohmad, Slim Frikha, Shi Hu, Abdalgader Abubaker, Reda Alami, Mikhail Lubinets, Mohamed El Amine Seddik, Hakim Hacid

This work introduces Falcon-H1R, a 7B-parameter reasoning-optimized model that establishes the feasibility of achieving competitive reasoning performance with small language models (SLMs). Falcon-H1R stands out for its parameter efficiency, consistently matching or outperforming SOTA reasoning models that are $2\times$ to $7\times$ larger across a variety of reasoning-intensive benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of careful data curation and targeted training strategies (via both efficient SFT and RL scaling) in delivering significant performance gains without increasing model size. Furthermore, Falcon-H1R advances the 3D limits of reasoning efficiency by combining faster inference (through its hybrid-parallel architecture design), token efficiency, and higher accuracy. This unique blend makes Falcon-H1R-7B a practical backbone for scaling advanced reasoning systems, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive chain-of-thoughts generation and parallel test-time scaling. Leveraging the recently introduced DeepConf approach, Falcon-H1R achieves state-of-the-art test-time scaling efficiency, offering substantial improvements in both accuracy and computational cost. As a result, Falcon-H1R demonstrates that compact models, through targeted model training and architectural choices, can deliver robust and scalable reasoning performance.

### 2. [Crafting Adversarial Inputs for Large Vision-Language Models Using Black-Box Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01747v1)

Authors: Jiwei Guan, Haibo Jin, Haohan Wang

Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown groundbreaking capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs

### 3. [Explicit World Models for Reliable Human-Robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01705v1)

Authors: Kenneth Kwok, Basura Fernando, Qianli Xu, Vigneshwaran Subbaraju, Dongkyu Choi, Boon Kiat Quek

This paper addresses the topic of robustness under sensing noise, ambiguous instructions, and human-robot interaction. We take a radically different tack to the issue of reliable embodied AI: instead of focusing on formal verification methods aimed at achieving model predictability and robustness, we emphasise the dynamic, ambiguous and subjective nature of human-robot interactions that requires embodied AI systems to perceive, interpret, and respond to human intentions in a manner that is consistent, comprehensible and aligned with human expectations. We argue that when embodied agents operate in human environments that are inherently social, multimodal, and fluid, reliability is contextually determined and only has meaning in relation to the goals and expectations of humans involved in the interaction. This calls for a fundamentally different approach to achieving reliable embodied AI that is centred on building and updating an accessible "explicit world model" representing the common ground between human and AI, that is used to align robot behaviours with human expectations.

### 4. [Jenius Agent: Towards Experience-Driven Accuracy Optimization in Real-World Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01857v1)

Authors: Defei Xia, Bingfeng Pi, Shenbin Zhang, Song Hua, Yunfei Wei, Lei Zuo

As agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) advance, improving the task performance of an autonomous agent, especially in context understanding, tool usage, and response generation, has become increasingly critical. Although prior studies have advanced the overall design of LLM-based agents, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored. This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback. The experiments show a 20 percent improvement in task accuracy, along with a reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures. The framework is already deployed in Jenius (https://www.jenius.cn), providing a lightweight and scalable solution for robust, protocol-compatible autonomous agents.

### 5. [Yukthi Opus: A Multi-Chain Hybrid Metaheuristic for Large-Scale NP-Hard Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01832v1)

Authors: SB Danush Vikraman, Hannah Abagail, Prasanna Kesavraj, Gajanan V Honnavar

We present Yukthi Opus (YO), a multi-chain hybrid metaheuristic designed for NP-hard optimization under explicit evaluation budget constraints. YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization.
  We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction. Overall, YO achieves competitive performance on large and multimodal problems while maintaining predictable evaluation budgets, making it suitable for expensive black-box optimization settings.

### 6. [Output Embedding Centering for Stable LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02031v1)

Authors: Felix Stollenwerk, Anna Lokrantz, Niclas Hertzberg

Pretraining of large language models is not only expensive but also prone to certain training instabilities. A specific instability that often occurs for large learning rates at the end of training is output logit divergence. The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called μ-centering, or a regularization method called μ-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that μ-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss.

### 7. [MindChat: A Privacy-preserving Large Language Model for Mental Health Support](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01993v1)

Authors: Dong Xue, Jicheng Tu, Ming Wang, Xin Yan, Fangzhou Liu, Jie Hu

Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for mental health support, yet training such models is constrained by the scarcity and sensitivity of real counseling dialogues. In this article, we present MindChat, a privacy-preserving LLM for mental health support, together with MindCorpus, a synthetic multi-turn counseling dataset constructed via a multi-agent role-playing framework. To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks.

### 8. [MMP-A*: Multimodal Perception Enhanced Incremental Heuristic Search on Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01910v1)

Authors: Minh Hieu Ha, Khanh Ly Ta, Hung Phan, Tung Doan, Tung Dao, Dao Tran, Huynh Thi Thanh Binh

Autonomous path planning requires a synergy between global reasoning and geometric precision, especially in complex or cluttered environments. While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.
  We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation.

### 9. [CogFlow: Bridging Perception and Reasoning through Knowledge Internalization for Visual Mathematical Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01874v1)

Authors: Shuhang Chen, Yunqiu Xu, Junjie Xie, Aojun Lu, Tao Feng, Zeying Huang, Ning Zhang, Yi Sun, Yi Yang, Hangjie Yuan

Despite significant progress, multimodal large language models continue to struggle with visual mathematical problem solving. Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\Rightarrow$internalization$\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on commonly used visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed CogFlow.

### 10. [TopoLoRA-SAM: Topology-Aware Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of Foundation Segmenters for Thin-Structure and Cross-Domain Binary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02273v1)

Authors: Salim Khazem

Foundation segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit strong zero-shot generalization through large-scale pretraining, but adapting them to domain-specific semantic segmentation remains challenging, particularly for thin structures (e.g., retinal vessels) and noisy modalities (e.g., SAR imagery). Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose \textbf{TopoLoRA-SAM}, a topology-aware and parameter-efficient adaptation framework for binary semantic segmentation. TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former. TopoLoRA-SAM achieves the best retina-average Dice and the best overall average Dice across datasets, while training only \textbf{5.2\%} of model parameters ($\sim$4.9M). On the challenging CHASE\_DB1 dataset, our method substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating that topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [HFRWKV: A High-Performance Fully On-Chip Hardware Accelerator for RWKV](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02135v1)

Authors: Liu Shijie, Zeng Zhenghao, Jiao Han, Huang Yihua

RWKV is a modern RNN architecture that approaches the performance of Transformers, with the advantage of processing long contexts at a linear memory cost. However, its sequential computation pattern struggles to efficiently leverage GPU parallelism, which leads to low compute resource utilization. Furthermore, frequent off-chip weight accesses create a memory bottleneck. To address these challenges, we propose HFRWKV, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator specifically designed for RWKV. Within the matrix operation module, we propose a novel hardware-friendly hybrid-precision quantization strategy, which enhances performance while maintaining acceptable accuracy. For the complex operations including exponentiation and division, we introduce a method featuring reusable architectures combined with lookup tables or piecewise linear approximation, which is algorithmically refined to effectively balance precision and hardware resource consumption. Based on this foundation, we adopt a fully on-chip computing system integrating parallel matrix-vector processing array and an efficient pipeline architecture. Through computation reordering and chunked double buffering, it effectively eliminates data transfer bottlenecks and improves overall throughput. We implement HFRWKV on the Alveo U50 and U280 platform. Experimental results show that compared to a CPU, a throughput improvement of 63.48$\times$ and an energy efficiency improvement of 139.17$\times$. Compared to GPUs, achieves a throughput improvement of 32.33$\times$ and an energy efficiency improvement of 171.36$\times$.

### 2. [Ageing Monitoring for Commercial Microcontrollers Based on Timing Windows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02053v1)

Authors: Leandro Lanzieri, Jiri Kral, Goerschwin Fey, Holger Schlarb, Thomas C. Schmidt

Microcontrollers are increasingly present in embedded deployments and dependable applications, for which malfunctions due to hardware ageing can have severe impact. The lack of deployable techniques for ageing monitoring on these devices has spread the application of guard bands to prevent timing errors due to degradation. Applying this static technique can limit performance and lead to sudden failures as devices age. In this paper, we follow a software-based self-testing approach to design monitoring of hardware degradation for microcontrollers. Deployable in the field, our technique leverages timing windows of variable lengths to determine the maximum operational frequency of the devices. We empirically validate the method on real hardware and find that it consistently detects temperature-induced degradations in maximum operating frequency of up to 13.79 % across devices for 60 °C temperature increase.

### 3. [Neuro-Channel Networks: A Multiplication-Free Architecture by Biological Signal Transmission](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02253v1)

Authors: Emrah Mete, Emin Erkan Korkmaz

The rapid proliferation of Deep Learning is increasingly constrained by its heavy reliance on high-performance hardware, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These specialized accelerators are not only prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive but also suffer from significant supply scarcity, limiting the ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment on edge devices. The core of this inefficiency stems from the standard artificial perceptron's dependence on intensive matrix multiplications. However, biological nervous systems achieve unparalleled efficiency without such arithmetic intensity; synaptic signal transmission is regulated by physical ion channel limits and chemical neurotransmitter levels rather than a process that can be analogous to arithmetic multiplication. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose Neuro-Channel Networks (NCN), a novel multiplication-free architecture designed to decouple AI from expensive hardware dependencies. In our model, weights are replaced with Channel Widths that physically limit the signal magnitude, while a secondary parameter acts as a Neurotransmitter to regulate Signal Transmission based on sign logic. The forward pass relies exclusively on addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations (minimum, sign), eliminating floating-point multiplication entirely. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that NCNs can solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR and the Majority function with 100% accuracy using standard backpropagation, proving their capability to form complex decision boundaries without multiplicative weights. This architecture offers a highly efficient alternative for next-generation neuromorphic hardware, paving the way for running complex models on commodity CPUs or ultra-low-power chips without relying on costly GPU clusters.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [Hidden costs for inference with deep network on embedded system devices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01698v1)

Authors: Chankyu Lee, Woohyun Choi, Sangwook Park

This study evaluates the inference performance of various deep learning models under an embedded system environment. In previous works, Multiply-Accumulate operation is typically used to measure computational load of a deep model. According to this study, however, this metric has a limitation to estimate inference time on embedded devices. This paper poses the question of what aspects are overlooked when expressed in terms of Multiply-Accumulate operations. In experiments, an image classification task is performed on an embedded system device using the CIFAR-100 dataset to compare and analyze the inference times of ten deep models with the theoretically calculated Multiply-Accumulate operations for each model. The results highlight the importance of considering additional computations between tensors when optimizing deep learning models for real-time performing in embedded systems.

### 2. [Context-Free Recognition with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01754v1)

Authors: Selim Jerad, Anej Svete, Sophie Hao, Ryan Cotterell, William Merrill

Transformers excel on tasks that process well-formed inputs according to some grammar, such as natural language and code. However, it remains unclear how they can process grammatical syntax. In fact, under standard complexity conjectures, standard transformers cannot recognize context-free languages (CFLs), a canonical formalism to describe syntax, or even regular languages, a subclass of CFLs (Merrill et al., 2022). Merrill & Sabharwal (2024) show that $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length $n$) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open. In this work, we show that looped transformers with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ looping layers and $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens can recognize all CFLs. However, training and inference with $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens is potentially impractical. Fortunately, we show that, for natural subclasses such as unambiguous CFLs, the recognition problem on transformers becomes more tractable, requiring $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ padding. We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms.

### Computational Engineering

### 1. [Can Large Language Models Solve Engineering Equations? A Systematic Comparison of Direct Prediction and Solver-Assisted Approaches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01774v1)

Authors: Sai Varun Kodathala, Rakesh Vunnam

Transcendental equations requiring iterative numerical solution pervade engineering practice, from fluid mechanics friction factor calculations to orbital position determination. We systematically evaluate whether Large Language Models can solve these equations through direct numerical prediction or whether a hybrid architecture combining LLM symbolic manipulation with classical iterative solvers proves more effective. Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition. These findings establish that contemporary LLMs excel at symbolic manipulation and domain knowledge retrieval but struggle with precision-critical iterative arithmetic, suggesting their optimal deployment as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines.

### 2. [Semantic Non-Fungibility and Violations of the Law of One Price in Prediction Markets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01706v1)

Authors: Jonas Gebele, Florian Matthes

Prediction markets are designed to aggregate dispersed information about future events, yet today's ecosystem is fragmented across heterogeneous operator-run platforms and blockchain-based protocols that independently list economically identical events. In the absence of a shared notion of event identity, liquidity fails to pool across venues, arbitrage becomes capital-intensive or unenforceable, and prices systematically violate the Law of One Price. As a result, market prices reflect platform-local beliefs rather than a single, globally aggregated probability, undermining the core information-aggregation function of prediction markets. We address this gap by introducing a semantic alignment framework that makes cross-platform event identity explicit through joint analysis of natural-language descriptions, resolution semantics, and temporal scope. Applying this framework, we construct the first human-validated, cross-platform dataset of aligned prediction markets, covering over 100 000 events across ten major venues from 2018 to 2025. Using this dataset, we show that roughly 6% of all events are concurrently listed across platforms and that semantically equivalent markets exhibit persistent execution-aware price deviations of 2-4% on average, even in highly liquid and information-rich settings. These mispricings give rise to persistent cross-platform arbitrage opportunities driven by structural frictions rather than informational disagreement. Overall, our results demonstrate that semantic non-fungibility is a fundamental barrier to price convergence, and that resolving event identity is a prerequisite for prediction markets to aggregate information at a global scale.

### 3. [PRIMAD-LID: A Developed Framework for Computational Reproducibility](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02349v1)

Authors: Meznah Aloqalaa, Stian Soiland-Reyes, Carole Goble

Over the past decade alongside increased focus on computational reproducibility significant efforts have been made to define reproducibility. However, these definitions provide a textual description rather than a framework. The community has sought conceptual frameworks that identify all factors that must be controlled and described for credible computational reproducibility. The PRIMAD model was initially introduced to address inconsistencies in terminology surrounding computational reproducibility by outlining six key factors: P (Platforms), R (Research objective), I (Implementations), M (Methods), A (Actors), and D (Data). Subsequently various studies across different fields adopted the model and proposed extensions. However, these contributions remain fragmented and require systematic integration and cross-disciplinary validation. To bridge this gap and recognising that PRIMAD provides a broadly applicable framework for reproducibility in computational science, this work undertakes a focused investigation of the PRIMAD model. It combines the models previous extensions into a unified framework suitable for diverse research contexts. The result is PRIMAD-LID, a discipline-diagnostic reproducibility framework that retains the original six PRIMAD dimensions and enhances each with three overarching modifiers: Lifespan (temporal qualifier), Interpretation (contextual reasoning) and Depth (necessary granularity), thereby establishing a more cohesive and robust foundation for computational reproducibility practices.

### 4. [Density-based topology optimization for turbulent fluid flow using the standard k-epsilon RANS model with wall-functions imposed through an implicit wall penalty formulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02202v1)

Authors: Amirhossein Bayat, Hao Li, Joe Alexandersen

Turbulent flows have high requirements for very fine meshes near the boundary to ensure accuracy. In the context of topology optimization (TO), such fine meshes become unrealistic and common approaches are hampered by low accuracy and overestimation of boundary layer thickness. Wall-functions are a natural way to ease the computational requirements, but they are not naturally imposed in density-based TO due to the diffuse design parametrization. We propose an implicit wall-function formulation for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), standard k-epsilon model that extracts wall-normal information directly from the gradient of the design variable and enables a penalty-based formulation for imposing wall-functions to the RANS equations, without the need for body-fitted meshes. The method provides a reliable route to high Reynolds number turbulent topology optimization, delivering boundary layer accuracy comparable to explicit-wall body-fitted analyses, while retaining the flexibility of density-based TO. Furthermore, because wall effects are modeled using wall-functions, accurate solutions are obtained on substantially coarser meshes, leading to significant reductions in computational cost. The approach is validated on three canonical benchmarks over Reynolds numbers up to Re = 2e5: a pipe-bend; a U-bend; and a Tesla-valve. Across all cases, the proposed method accurately recovers near-wall velocity profiles, closely matching verification simulations on body-fitted meshes with explicit wall-functions. In contrast, a conventional turbulent TO formulation, without the proposed wall-function treatment, mispredicts boundary-layer development and yields sub-optimal results.

### 5. [A stable and accurate X-FFT solver for linear elastic homogenization problems in 3D](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02172v1)

Authors: Flavia Gehrig, Matti Schneider

Although FFT-based methods are renowned for their numerical efficiency and stability, traditional discretizations fail to capture material interfaces that are not aligned with the grid, resulting in suboptimal accuracy. To address this issue, the work at hand introduces a novel FFT-based solver that achieves interface-conforming accuracy for three-dimensional mechanical problems. More precisely, we integrate the extended finite element (X-FEM) discretization into the FFT-based framework, leveraging its ability to resolve discontinuities via additional shape functions. We employ the modified abs(olute) enrichment and develop a preconditioner based on the concept of strongly stable GFEM, which mitigates the conditioning issues observed in traditional X-FEM implementations. Our computational studies demonstrate that the developed X-FFT solver achieves interface-conforming accuracy, numerical efficiency, and stability when solving three-dimensional linear elastic homogenization problems with smooth material interfaces.

### 6. [MDAgent2: Large Language Model for Code Generation and Knowledge Q&A in Molecular Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02075v1)

Authors: Zhuofan Shi, Hubao A, Yufei Shao, Mengyan Dai, Yadong Yu, Pan Xiang, Dongliang Huang, Hongxu An, Chunxiao Xin, Haiyang Shen, Zhenyu Wang, Yunshan Na, Gang Huang, Xiang Jing

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding atomic-scale behaviors in materials science, yet writing LAMMPS scripts remains highly specialized and time-consuming tasks. Although LLMs show promise in code generation and domain-specific question answering, their performance in MD scenarios is limited by scarce domain data, the high deployment cost of state-of-the-art LLMs, and low code executability. Building upon our prior MDAgent, we present MDAgent2, the first end-to-end framework capable of performing both knowledge Q&A and code generation within the MD domain. We construct a domain-specific data-construction pipeline that yields three high-quality datasets spanning MD knowledge, question answering, and code generation. Based on these datasets, we adopt a three stage post-training strategy--continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL)--to train two domain-adapted models, MD-Instruct and MD-Code. Furthermore, we introduce MD-GRPO, a closed-loop RL method that leverages simulation outcomes as reward signals and recycles low-reward trajectories for continual refinement. We further build MDAgent2-RUNTIME, a deployable multi-agent system that integrates code generation, execution, evaluation, and self-correction. Together with MD-EvalBench proposed in this work, the first benchmark for LAMMPS code generation and question answering, our models and system achieve performance surpassing several strong baselines.This work systematically demonstrates the adaptability and generalization capability of large language models in industrial simulation tasks, laying a methodological foundation for automatic code generation in AI for Science and industrial-scale simulations.

### Computation and Language

### 1. [BanglaIPA: Towards Robust Text-to-IPA Transcription with Contextual Rewriting in Bengali](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01778v1)

Authors: Jakir Hasan, Shrestha Datta, Md Saiful Islam, Shubhashis Roy Dipta, Ameya Debnath

Despite its widespread use, Bengali lacks a robust automated International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription system that effectively supports both standard language and regional dialectal texts. Existing approaches struggle to handle regional variations, numerical expressions, and generalize poorly to previously unseen words. To address these limitations, we propose BanglaIPA, a novel IPA generation system that integrates a character-based vocabulary with word-level alignment. The proposed system accurately handles Bengali numerals and demonstrates strong performance across regional dialects. BanglaIPA improves inference efficiency by leveraging a precomputed word-to-IPA mapping dictionary for previously observed words. The system is evaluated on the standard Bengali and six regional variations of the DUAL-IPA dataset. Experimental results show that BanglaIPA outperforms baseline IPA transcription models by 58.4-78.7% and achieves an overall mean word error rate of 11.4%, highlighting its robustness in phonetic transcription generation for the Bengali language.

### 2. [CSCBench: A PVC Diagnostic Benchmark for Commodity Supply Chain Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01825v1)

Authors: Yaxin Cui, Yuanqiang Zeng, Jiapeng Yan, Keling Lin, Kai Ji, Jianhui Zeng, Sheng Zhang, Xin Luo, Binzhu Su, Chaolai Shen, Jiahao Yu

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in general benchmarks, yet their competence in commodity supply chains (CSCs) -- a domain governed by institutional rule systems and feasibility constraints -- remains under-explored. CSC decisions are shaped jointly by process stages (e.g., planning, procurement, delivery), variety-specific rules (e.g., contract specifications and delivery grades), and reasoning depth (from retrieval to multi-step analysis and decision selection). We introduce CSCBench, a 2.3K+ single-choice benchmark for CSC reasoning, instantiated through our PVC 3D Evaluation Framework (Process, Variety, and Cognition). The Process axis aligns tasks with SCOR+Enable; the Variety axis operationalizes commodity-specific rule systems under coupled material-information-financial constraints, grounded in authoritative exchange guidebooks/rulebooks and industry reports; and the Cognition axis follows Bloom's revised taxonomy. Evaluating representative LLMs under a direct prompting setting, we observe strong performance on the Process and Cognition axes but substantial degradation on the Variety axis, especially on Freight Agreements. CSCBench provides a diagnostic yardstick for measuring and improving LLM capabilities in this high-stakes domain.

### 3. [Output Embedding Centering for Stable LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02031v1)

Pretraining of large language models is not only expensive but also prone to certain training instabilities. A specific instability that often occurs for large learning rates at the end of training is output logit divergence. The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called μ-centering, or a regularization method called μ-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that μ-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss.

### 4. [Power-of-Two Quantization-Aware-Training (PoT-QAT) in Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02298v1)

Authors: Mahmoud Elgenedy

In Large Language Models (LLMs), the number of parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years, e.g., from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT-2 to 175 billion in GPT-3 to possibly more than trillion in higher versions. This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices. Unlike cloud computing, memory and processing power for Edge devices are very limited, which necessitates developing novel ideas to make such applications feasible. In this work, we investigate compressing weights with a special quantization that limits numbers to only power-of-two (PoT). This helps save a huge amount of memory as only exponents need to be stored, more importantly, it significantly reduces processing power by replacing costly multiplication with low cost bit shifting. To overcome performance loss due to this strict quantization, we investigate Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to enhance performance through additional training. Results on GPT-2 124M show a major enhancement for quantized PoT model after additional training, with a perplexity enhancement of 66% and BERT-Score loss to baseline GPT-2 of 1%. The memory saving is estimated to be 87.5% while the inference speed is expected to be 3-10x faster with PoT quantization versus full-precision.

### 5. [HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01792v1)

Authors: NAVER Cloud HyperCLOVA X Team

In this report, we present HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni, the first any-to-any omnimodal model in the HyperCLOVA X family that supports text, audio, and vision as both inputs and outputs. By consolidating multimodal understanding and generation into a single model rather than separate modality-specific pipelines, HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni serves as an 8B-scale omni-pathfinding point toward practical any-to-any omni assistants. At a high level, the model unifies modalities through a shared next-token prediction interface over an interleaved multimodal sequence, while vision and audio encoders inject continuous embeddings for fine-grained understanding and grounding. Empirical evaluations demonstrate competitive performance against comparably sized models across diverse input-output combinations spanning text, audio, and vision, in both Korean and English. We anticipate that the open-weight release of HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni will support a wide range of research and deployment scenarios.

### 6. [Confidence Estimation for LLMs in Multi-turn Interactions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02179v1)

Authors: Caiqi Zhang, Ruihan Yang, Xiaochen Zhu, Chengzu Li, Tiancheng Hu, Yijiang River Dong, Deqing Yang, Nigel Collier

While confidence estimation is a promising direction for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), current research dominantly focuses on single-turn settings. The dynamics of model confidence in multi-turn conversations, where context accumulates and ambiguity is progressively resolved, remain largely unexplored. Reliable confidence estimation in multi-turn settings is critical for many downstream applications, such as autonomous agents and human-in-the-loop systems. This work presents the first systematic study of confidence estimation in multi-turn interactions, establishing a formal evaluation framework grounded in two key desiderata: per-turn calibration and monotonicity of confidence as more information becomes available. To facilitate this, we introduce novel metrics, including a length-normalized Expected Calibration Error (InfoECE), and a new "Hinter-Guesser" paradigm for generating controlled evaluation datasets. Our experiments reveal that widely-used confidence techniques struggle with calibration and monotonicity in multi-turn dialogues. We propose P(Sufficient), a logit-based probe that achieves comparatively better performance, although the task remains far from solved. Our work provides a foundational methodology for developing more reliable and trustworthy conversational agents.

Authors: Almaz Ermilov

This paper presents FormationEval, an open multiple-choice question benchmark for evaluating language models on petroleum geoscience and subsurface disciplines. The dataset contains 505 questions across seven domains including petrophysics, petroleum geology and reservoir engineering, derived from three authoritative sources using a reasoning model with detailed instructions and a concept-based approach that avoids verbatim copying of copyrighted text. Each question includes source metadata to support traceability and audit. The evaluation covers 72 models from major providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta and open-weight alternatives. The top performers achieve over 97\% accuracy, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview reaching 99.8\%, while tier and domain gaps persist. Among open-weight models, GLM-4.7 leads at 98.6\%, with several DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen and Mistral models also exceeding 93\%. The performance gap between open-weight and closed models is narrower than expected, with several lower-cost open-weight models exceeding 90\% accuracy. Petrophysics emerges as the most challenging domain across all models, while smaller models show wider performance variance. Residual length bias in the dataset (correct answers tend to be longer) is documented along with bias mitigation strategies applied during construction. The benchmark, evaluation code and results are publicly available.

### 8. [Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning: Resolving Confident Conflicts to Mitigate Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02151v1)

Authors: Muxi Diao, Lele Yang, Wuxuan Gong, Yutong Zhang, Zhonghao Yan, Yufei Han, Kongming Liang, Weiran Xu, Zhanyu Ma

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the standard paradigm for domain adaptation, yet it frequently incurs the cost of catastrophic forgetting. In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as "Confident Conflicts" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities.

### 9. [Routing by Analogy: kNN-Augmented Expert Assignment for Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02144v1)

Authors: Boxuan Lyu, Soichiro Murakami, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Peinan Zhang

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale large language models efficiently by employing a parametric "router" to dispatch tokens to a sparse subset of experts. Typically, this router is trained once and then frozen, rendering routing decisions brittle under distribution shifts. We address this limitation by introducing kNN-MoE, a retrieval-augmented routing framework that reuses optimal expert assignments from a memory of similar past cases. This memory is constructed offline by directly optimizing token-wise routing logits to maximize the likelihood on a reference set. Crucially, we use the aggregate similarity of retrieved neighbors as a confidence-driven mixing coefficient, thus allowing the method to fall back to the frozen router when no relevant cases are found. Experiments show kNN-MoE outperforms zero-shot baselines and rivals computationally expensive supervised fine-tuning.

Authors: Juan-José Guzmán-Landa, Juan-Manuel Torres-Moreno, Miguel Figueroa-Saavedra, Carlos-Emiliano González-Gallardo, Graham Ranger, Martha Lorena-Avendaño-Garrido

Mexico is a country with a large number of indigenous languages, among which the most widely spoken is Nawatl, with more than two million people currently speaking it (mainly in North and Central America). Despite its rich cultural heritage, which dates back to the 15th century, Nawatl is a language with few computer resources. The problem is compounded when it comes to its dialectal varieties, with approximately 30 varieties recognised, not counting the different spellings in the written forms of the language. In this research work, we addressed the problem of classifying Nawatl varieties using Machine Learning and Neural Networks.

### 1. [Why Commodity WiFi Sensors Fail at Multi-Person Gait Identification: A Systematic Analysis Using ESP32](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02177v1)

Authors: Oliver Custance, Saad Khan, Simon Parkinson

WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) has shown promise for single-person gait identification, with numerous studies reporting high accuracy. However, multi-person identification remains largely unexplored, with the limited existing work relying on complex, expensive setups requiring modified firmware. A critical question remains unanswered: is poor multi-person performance an algorithmic limitation or a fundamental hardware constraint? We systematically evaluate six diverse signal separation methods (FastICA, SOBI, PCA, NMF, Wavelet, Tensor Decomposition) across seven scenarios with 1-10 people using commodity ESP32 WiFi sensors--a simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf solution. Through novel diagnostic metrics (intra-subject variability, inter-subject distinguishability, performance degradation rate), we reveal that all methods achieve similarly low accuracy (45-56\%, $σ$=3.74\%) with statistically insignificant differences (p $>$ 0.05). Even the best-performing method, NMF, achieves only 56\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals high intra-subject variability, low inter-subject distinguishability, and severe performance degradation as person count increases, indicating that commodity ESP32 sensors cannot provide sufficient signal quality for reliable multi-person separation.

### 2. [Crafting Adversarial Inputs for Large Vision-Language Models Using Black-Box Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01747v1)

Authors: Jiwei Guan, Haibo Jin, Haohan Wang

Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown groundbreaking capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs

### 3. [Improved Accuracy for Private Continual Cardinality Estimation in Fully Dynamic Streams via Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02257v1)

Authors: Joel Daniel Andersson, Palak Jain, Satchit Sivakumar

We study differentially-private statistics in the fully dynamic continual observation model, where many updates can arrive at each time step and updates to a stream can involve both insertions and deletions of an item. Earlier work (e.g., Jain et al., NeurIPS 2023 for counting distinct elements; Raskhodnikova & Steiner, PODS 2025 for triangle counting with edge updates) reduced the respective cardinality estimation problem to continual counting on the difference stream associated with the true function values on the input stream. In such reductions, a change in the original stream can cause many changes in the difference stream, this poses a challenge for applying private continual counting algorithms to obtain optimal error bounds. We improve the accuracy of several such reductions by studying the associated $\ell_p$-sensitivity vectors of the resulting difference streams and isolating their properties.
  We demonstrate that our framework gives improved bounds for counting distinct elements, estimating degree histograms, and estimating triangle counts (under a slightly relaxed privacy model), thus offering a general approach to private continual cardinality estimation in streaming settings. Our improved accuracy stems from tight analysis of known factorization mechanisms for the counting matrix in this setting; the key technical challenge is arguing that one can use state-of-the-art factorizations for sensitivity vector sets with the properties we isolate. Empirically and analytically, we demonstrate that our improved error bounds offer a substantial improvement in accuracy for cardinality estimation problems over a large range of parameters.

### 4. [From Chat Control to Robot Control: The Backdoors Left Open for the Sake of Safety](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02205v1)

Authors: Neziha Akalin, Alberto Giaretta

This paper explores how a recent European Union proposal, the so-called Chat Control law, which creates regulatory incentives for providers to implement content detection and communication scanning, could transform the foundations of human-robot interaction (HRI). As robots increasingly act as interpersonal communication channels in care, education, and telepresence, they convey not only speech but also gesture, emotion, and contextual cues. We argue that extending digital surveillance laws to such embodied systems would entail continuous monitoring, embedding observation into the very design of everyday robots. This regulation blurs the line between protection and control, turning companions into potential informants. At the same time, monitoring mechanisms that undermine end-to-end encryption function as de facto backdoors, expanding the attack surface and allowing adversaries to exploit legally induced monitoring infrastructures. This creates a paradox of safety through insecurity: systems introduced to protect users may instead compromise their privacy, autonomy, and trust. This work does not aim to predict the future, but to raise awareness and help prevent certain futures from materialising.

### 5. [UnPII: Unlearning Personally Identifiable Information with Quantifiable Exposure Risk](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01786v1)

Authors: Intae Jeon, Yujeong Kwon, Hyungjoon Koo

The ever-increasing adoption of Large Language Models in critical sectors like finance, healthcare, and government raises privacy concerns regarding the handling of sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) during training. In response, regulations such as European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate the deletion of PII upon requests, underscoring the need for reliable and cost-effective data removal solutions. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising direction for selectively forgetting data points. However, existing unlearning techniques typically apply a uniform forgetting strategy that neither accounts for the varying privacy risks posed by different PII attributes nor reflects associated business risks. In this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning approach that prioritizes forgetting based on the risk of individual or combined PII attributes. To this end, we introduce the PII risk index (PRI), a composite metric that incorporates multiple dimensions of risk factors: identifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy. The PRI enables a nuanced evaluation of privacy risks associated with PII exposures and can be tailored to align with organizational privacy policies. To support realistic assessment, we systematically construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that simulates realistic exposure scenarios. UnPII seamlessly integrates with established unlearning algorithms, such as Gradient Ascent, Negative Preference Optimization, and Direct Preference Optimization, without modifying their underlying principles. Our experimental results demonstrate that UnPII achieves the improvements of accuracy up to 11.8%, utility up to 6.3%, and generalizability up to 12.4%, respectively, while incurring a modest fine-tuning overhead of 27.5% on average during unlearning.

### 6. [Vouchsafe: A Zero-Infrastructure Capability Graph Model for Offline Identity and Trust](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02254v1)

Authors: Jay Kuri

Modern identity and trust systems collapse in the environments where they are needed most: disaster zones, disconnected or damaged networks, and adversarial conditions such as censorship or infrastructure interference. These systems depend on functioning networks to reach online authorities, resolvers, directories, and revocation services, leaving trust unverifiable whenever communication is unavailable or untrusted. This work demonstrates that secure identity and trust are possible without such infrastructure. We introduce the Zero-Infrastructure Capability Graph (ZI-CG), a model showing that identity, delegation, and revocation can be represented as self-contained, signed statements whose validity is determined entirely by local, deterministic evaluation. We further present Vouchsafe, a complete working instantiation of this model built using widely deployed primitives including Ed25519, SHA-256, and structured JSON Web Tokens, requiring no new cryptography or online services. The results show that a practical, offline-verifiable trust substrate can be constructed today using only the cryptographic data presented at evaluation time.

### 7. [Quantum AI for Cybersecurity: A hybrid Quantum-Classical models for attack path analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02237v1)

Authors: Jessica A. Sciammarelli, Waqas Ahmed

Modern cyberattacks are increasingly complex, posing significant challenges to classical machine learning methods, particularly when labeled data is limited and feature interactions are highly non-linear. In this study we investigates the potential of hybrid quantum-classical learning to enhance feature representations for intrusion detection and explore possible quantum advantages in cybersecurity analytics. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, network traffic is transformed into structured feature vectors through classical preprocessing and normalization. Classical models, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines with linear and RBF kernels, are evaluated on the full dataset to establish baseline performance under large-sample conditions. Simultaneously, a quantum-enhanced pipeline maps classical features into variational quantum circuits via angle encoding and entangling layers, executed on a CPU-based quantum simulator, with resulting quantum embeddings classified using a classical SVM. Experiments show that while classical models achieve higher overall accuracy with large datasets, quantum-enhanced representations demonstrate superior attack recall and improved class separability when data is scarce, suggesting that quantum feature spaces capture complex correlations inaccessible to shallow classical models. These results highlight the potential of quantum embeddings to improve generalization and representation quality in cybersecurity tasks and provide a reproducible framework for evaluating quantum advantages as quantum hardware and simulators continue to advance.

Authors: Michiel Van Kenhove, Erik Pohle, Leonard Schild, Martin Zbudila, Merlijn Sebrechts, Filip De Turck, Bruno Volckaert, Aysajan Abidin

The rapid increase of Internet of Things (IoT) systems across several domains has led to the generation of vast volumes of sensitive data, presenting significant challenges in terms of storage and data analytics. Cloud-assisted IoT solutions offer storage, scalability, and computational resources, but introduce new security and privacy risks that conventional trust-based approaches fail to adequately mitigate. To address these challenges, this paper presents MOZAIK, a novel end-to-end privacy-preserving confidential data storage and distributed processing architecture tailored for IoT-to-cloud scenarios. MOZAIK ensures that data remains encrypted throughout its lifecycle, including during transmission, storage, and processing. This is achieved by employing a cryptographic privacy-enhancing technology known as computing on encrypted data (COED). Two distinct COED techniques are explored, specifically secure multi-party computation (MPC) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The paper includes a comprehensive analysis of the MOZAIK architecture, including a proof-of-concept implementation and performance evaluations. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of the MOZAIK system and indicate the cost of an end-to-end privacy-preserving system compared to regular plaintext alternatives. All components of the MOZAIK platform are released as open-source software alongside this publication, with the aim of advancing secure and privacy-preserving data processing practices.

### 9. [Local Layer-wise Differential Privacy in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01737v1)

Authors: Yunbo Li, Jiaping Gui, Fanchao Meng, Yue Wu

Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct data sharing, yet it remains vulnerable to privacy attacks such as model inversion and membership inference. Existing differential privacy (DP) solutions for FL often inject noise uniformly across the entire model, degrading utility while providing suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs. To address this, we propose LaDP, a novel layer-wise adaptive noise injection mechanism for FL that optimizes privacy protection while preserving model accuracy. LaDP leverages two key insights: (1) neural network layers contribute unevenly to model utility, and (2) layer-wise privacy leakage can be quantified via KL divergence between local and global model distributions. LaDP dynamically injects noise into selected layers based on their privacy sensitivity and importance to model performance.
  We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that LaDP satisfies $(ε, δ)$-DP guarantees and converges under bounded noise. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 datasets demonstrate that LaDP reduces noise injection by 46.14% on average compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while improving accuracy by 102.99%. Under the same privacy budget, LaDP outperforms SOTA solutions like Dynamic Privacy Allocation LDP and AdapLDP by 25.18% and 6.1% in accuracy, respectively. Additionally, LaDP robustly defends against reconstruction attacks, increasing the FID of the reconstructed private data by $>$12.84% compared to all baselines. Our work advances the practical deployment of privacy-preserving FL with minimal utility loss.

### 10. [Structural Representations for Cross-Attack Generalization in AI Agent Threat Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01723v1)

Authors: Vignesh Iyer

Autonomous AI agents executing multi-step tool sequences face semantic attacks that manifest in behavioral traces rather than isolated prompts. A critical challenge is cross-attack generalization: can detectors trained on known attack families recognize novel, unseen attack types? We discover that standard conversational tokenization -- capturing linguistic patterns from agent interactions -- fails catastrophically on structural attacks like tool hijacking (AUC 0.39) and data exfiltration (AUC 0.46), while succeeding on linguistic attacks like social engineering (AUC 0.78). We introduce structural tokenization, encoding execution-flow patterns (tool calls, arguments, observations) rather than conversational content. This simple representational change dramatically improves cross-attack generalization: +46 AUC points on tool hijacking, +39 points on data exfiltration, and +71 points on unknown attacks, while simultaneously improving in-distribution performance (+6 points). For attacks requiring linguistic features, we propose gated multi-view fusion that adaptively combines both representations, achieving AUC 0.89 on social engineering without sacrificing structural attack detection. Our findings reveal that AI agent security is fundamentally a structural problem: attack semantics reside in execution patterns, not surface language. While our rule-based tokenizer serves as a baseline, the structural abstraction principle generalizes even with simple implementation.

### 1. [ExposeAnyone: Personalized Audio-to-Expression Diffusion Models Are Robust Zero-Shot Face Forgery Detectors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02359v1)

Authors: Kaede Shiohara, Toshihiko Yamasaki, Vladislav Golyanik

Detecting unknown deepfake manipulations remains one of the most challenging problems in face forgery detection. Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection.

Authors: Tom Burgert, Leonard Hackel, Paolo Rota, Begüm Demir

Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a powerful paradigm for learning from large, unlabeled datasets, particularly in computer vision (CV). However, applying SSL to multispectral remote sensing (RS) images presents unique challenges and opportunities due to the geographical and temporal variability of the data. In this paper, we introduce GeoRank, a novel regularization method for contrastive SSL that improves upon prior techniques by directly optimizing spherical distances to embed geographical relationships into the learned feature space. GeoRank outperforms or matches prior methods that integrate geographical metadata and consistently improves diverse contrastive SSL algorithms (e.g., BYOL, DINO). Beyond this, we present a systematic investigation of key adaptations of contrastive SSL for multispectral RS images, including the effectiveness of data augmentations, the impact of dataset cardinality and image size on performance, and the task dependency of temporal views.

Authors: Salim Khazem

Foundation segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit strong zero-shot generalization through large-scale pretraining, but adapting them to domain-specific semantic segmentation remains challenging, particularly for thin structures (e.g., retinal vessels) and noisy modalities (e.g., SAR imagery). Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose \textbf{TopoLoRA-SAM}, a topology-aware and parameter-efficient adaptation framework for binary semantic segmentation. TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former. TopoLoRA-SAM achieves the best retina-average Dice and the best overall average Dice across datasets, while training only \textbf{5.2\%} of model parameters ($\sim$4.9M). On the challenging CHASE\_DB1 dataset, our method substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating that topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models.

Authors: Dachun Kai, Zeyu Xiao, Huyue Zhu, Jiaxiao Wang, Yueyi Zhang, Xiaoyan Sun

This paper addresses low-light video super-resolution (LVSR), aiming to restore high-resolution videos from low-light, low-resolution (LR) inputs. Existing LVSR methods often struggle to recover fine details due to limited contrast and insufficient high-frequency information. To overcome these challenges, we present RetinexEVSR, the first event-driven LVSR framework that leverages high-contrast event signals and Retinex-inspired priors to enhance video quality under low-light scenarios. Unlike previous approaches that directly fuse degraded signals, RetinexEVSR introduces a novel bidirectional cross-modal fusion strategy to extract and integrate meaningful cues from noisy event data and degraded RGB frames. Specifically, an illumination-guided event enhancement module is designed to progressively refine event features using illumination maps derived from the Retinex model, thereby suppressing low-light artifacts while preserving high-contrast details. Furthermore, we propose an event-guided reflectance enhancement module that utilizes the enhanced event features to dynamically recover reflectance details via a multi-scale fusion mechanism. Experimental results show that our RetinexEVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Notably, on the SDSD benchmark, our method can get up to 2.95 dB gain while reducing runtime by 65% compared to prior event-based methods. Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/RetinexEVSR.

### 6. [Efficient Unrolled Networks for Large-Scale 3D Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02141v1)

Authors: Romain Vo, Julián Tachella

Deep learning-based methods have revolutionized the field of imaging inverse problems, yielding state-of-the-art performance across various imaging domains. The best performing networks incorporate the imaging operator within the network architecture, typically in the form of deep unrolling. However, in large-scale problems, such as 3D imaging, most existing methods fail to incorporate the operator in the architecture due to the prohibitive amount of memory required by global forward operators, which hinder typical patching strategies. In this work, we present a domain partitioning strategy and normal operator approximations that enable the training of end-to-end reconstruction models incorporating forward operators of arbitrarily large problems into their architecture. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D X-ray cone-beam tomography and 3D multi-coil accelerated MRI, while requiring only a single GPU for both training and inference.

### 7. [Car Drag Coefficient Prediction from 3D Point Clouds Using a Slice-Based Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02112v1)

Authors: Utkarsh Singh, Absaar Ali, Adarsh Roy

The automotive industry's pursuit of enhanced fuel economy and performance necessitates efficient aerodynamic design. However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration.

### 8. [GCR: Geometry-Consistent Routing for Task-Agnostic Continual Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01856v1)

Authors: Joongwon Chae, Lihui Luo, Yang Liu, Runming Wang, Dongmei Yu, Zeming Liang, Xi Yuan, Dayan Zhang, Zhenglin Chen, Peiwu Qin, Ilmoon Chae

Feature-based anomaly detection is widely adopted in industrial inspection due to the strong representational power of large pre-trained vision encoders. While most existing methods focus on improving within-category anomaly scoring, practical deployments increasingly require task-agnostic operation under continual category expansion, where the category identity is unknown at test time. In this setting, overall performance is often dominated by expert selection, namely routing an input to an appropriate normality model before any head-specific scoring is applied. However, routing rules that compare head-specific anomaly scores across independently constructed heads are unreliable in practice, as score distributions can differ substantially across categories in scale and tail behavior.
  We propose GCR, a lightweight mixture-of-experts framework for stabilizing task-agnostic continual anomaly detection through geometry-consistent routing. GCR routes each test image directly in a shared frozen patch-embedding space by minimizing an accumulated nearest-prototype distance to category-specific prototype banks, and then computes anomaly maps only within the routed expert using a standard prototype-based scoring rule. By separating cross-head decision making from within-head anomaly scoring, GCR avoids cross-head score comparability issues without requiring end-to-end representation learning.
  Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA show that geometry-consistent routing substantially improves routing stability and mitigates continual performance collapse, achieving near-zero forgetting while maintaining competitive detection and localization performance. These results indicate that many failures previously attributed to representation forgetting can instead be explained by decision-rule instability in cross-head routing.

Authors: Chuhang Ma, Shuai Tan, Ye Pan, Jiaolong Yang, Xin Tong

Most current audio-driven facial animation research primarily focuses on generating videos with neutral emotions. While some studies have addressed the generation of facial videos driven by emotional audio, efficiently generating high-quality talking head videos that integrate both emotional expressions and style features remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ESGaussianFace, an innovative framework for emotional and stylized audio-driven facial animation. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct 3D scenes and render videos, ensuring efficient generation of 3D consistent results. We propose an emotion-audio-guided spatial attention method that effectively integrates emotion features with audio content features. Through emotion-guided attention, the model is able to reconstruct facial details across different emotional states more accurately. To achieve emotional and stylized deformations of the 3D Gaussian points through emotion and style features, we introduce two 3D Gaussian deformation predictors. Futhermore, we propose a multi-stage training strategy, enabling the step-by-step learning of the character's lip movements, emotional variations, and style features. Our generated results exhibit high efficiency, high quality, and 3D consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of lip movement accuracy, expression variation, and style feature expressiveness.

Authors: Haato Watanabe, Nobuyuki Umetani

Physics simulation of slender elastic objects often requires discretization as a polyline. However, constructing a polyline from Gaussian splatting is challenging as Gaussian splatting lacks connectivity information and the configuration of Gaussian primitives contains much noise. This paper presents a method to extract a polyline representation of the slender part of the objects in a Gaussian splatting scene from the user's sketching input. Our method robustly constructs a polyline mesh that represents the slender parts using the screen-space shortest path analysis that can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several in-the-wild examples.

### 1. [From Chat Control to Robot Control: The Backdoors Left Open for the Sake of Safety](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02205v1)

Authors: Neziha Akalin, Alberto Giaretta

This paper explores how a recent European Union proposal, the so-called Chat Control law, which creates regulatory incentives for providers to implement content detection and communication scanning, could transform the foundations of human-robot interaction (HRI). As robots increasingly act as interpersonal communication channels in care, education, and telepresence, they convey not only speech but also gesture, emotion, and contextual cues. We argue that extending digital surveillance laws to such embodied systems would entail continuous monitoring, embedding observation into the very design of everyday robots. This regulation blurs the line between protection and control, turning companions into potential informants. At the same time, monitoring mechanisms that undermine end-to-end encryption function as de facto backdoors, expanding the attack surface and allowing adversaries to exploit legally induced monitoring infrastructures. This creates a paradox of safety through insecurity: systems introduced to protect users may instead compromise their privacy, autonomy, and trust. This work does not aim to predict the future, but to raise awareness and help prevent certain futures from materialising.

### 2. [When Attention Becomes Exposure in Generative Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01750v1)

Authors: Shayan Alipour, Mehdi Kargar, Morteza Zihayat

Generative search engines are reshaping information access by replacing traditional ranked lists with synthesized answers and references. In parallel, with the growth of Web3 platforms, incentive-driven creator ecosystems have become an essential part of how enterprises build visibility and community by rewarding creators for contributing to shared narratives. However, the extent to which exposure in generative search engine citations is shaped by external attention markets remains uncertain. In this study, we audit the exposure for 44 Web3 enterprises. First, we show that the creator community around each enterprise is persistent over time. Second, enterprise-specific queries reveal that more popular voices systematically receive greater citation exposure than others. Third, we find that larger follower bases and enterprises with more concentrated creator cores are associated with higher-ranked exposure. Together, these results show that generative search engine citations exhibit exposure bias toward already prominent voices, which risks entrenching incumbents and narrowing viewpoint diversity.

As large language models are deployed in high-stakes enterprise applications, from healthcare to finance, ensuring adherence to organization-specific policies has become essential. Yet existing safety evaluations focus exclusively on universal harms. We present COMPASS (Company/Organization Policy Alignment Assessment), the first systematic framework for evaluating whether LLMs comply with organizational allowlist and denylist policies. We apply COMPASS to eight diverse industry scenarios, generating and validating 5,920 queries that test both routine compliance and adversarial robustness through strategically designed edge cases. Evaluating seven state-of-the-art models, we uncover a fundamental asymmetry: models reliably handle legitimate requests (>95% accuracy) but catastrophically fail at enforcing prohibitions, refusing only 13-40% of adversarial denylist violations. These results demonstrate that current LLMs lack the robustness required for policy-critical deployments, establishing COMPASS as an essential evaluation framework for organizational AI safety.

### 4. [Theory Trace Card: Theory-Driven Socio-Cognitive Evaluation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01878v1)

Authors: Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi, Suhaib Abdurahman, Zhivar Sourati, Jackson Trager, Morteza Dehghani

Socio-cognitive benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often fail to predict real-world behavior, even when models achieve high benchmark scores. Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory.

The Arabic language is characterized by a rich tapestry of regional dialects that differ substantially in phonetics and lexicon, reflecting the geographic and cultural diversity of its speakers. Despite the availability of many multi-dialect datasets, mapping speech to fine-grained dialect sources, such as cities, remains underexplored. We present ARCADE (Arabic Radio Corpus for Audio Dialect Evaluation), the first Arabic speech dataset designed explicitly with city-level dialect granularity. The corpus comprises Arabic radio speech collected from streaming services across the Arab world. Our data pipeline captures 30-second segments from verified radio streams, encompassing both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and diverse dialectal speech. To ensure reliability, each clip was annotated by one to three native Arabic reviewers who assigned rich metadata, including emotion, speech type, dialect category, and a validity flag for dialect identification tasks. The resulting corpus comprises 6,907 annotations and 3,790 unique audio segments spanning 58 cities across 19 countries. These fine-grained annotations enable robust multi-task learning, serving as a benchmark for city-level dialect tagging. We detail the data collection methodology, assess audio quality, and provide a comprehensive analysis of label distributions. The dataset is available on: https://huggingface.co/datasets/riotu-lab/ARCADE-full

### 1. [Octopus: A Lightweight Entity-Aware System for Multi-Table Data Discovery and Cell-Level Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02304v1)

Authors: Wen-Zhi Li, Sainyam Galhotra

Tabular data constitute a dominant form of information in modern data lakes and repositories, yet discovering the relevant tables to answer user questions remains challenging. Existing data discovery systems assume that each question can be answered by a single table and often rely on resource-intensive offline preprocessing, such as model training or large-scale content indexing. In practice, however, many questions require information spread across multiple tables -- either independently or through joins -- and users often seek specific cell values rather than entire tables. In this paper, we present Octopus, a lightweight, entity-aware, and training-free system for multi-table data discovery and cell-level value retrieval. Instead of embedding entire questions, Octopus identifies fine-grained entities (column mentions and value mentions) from natural-language queries using an LLM parser. It then matches these entities to table headers through a compact embedding index and scans table contents directly for value occurrences, eliminating the need for heavy content indexing or costly offline stages. The resulting fine-grained alignment not only improves table retrieval accuracy but also facilitates efficient downstream NL2SQL execution by reducing token usage and redundant LLM calls. To evaluate Octopus, we introduce a new benchmark covering both table- and cell-level discovery under multi-table settings, including five datasets for independent discovery and two for join-based discovery. Experimental results show that Octopus consistently outperforms existing systems while achieving substantially lower computational and token costs. Code is available at https://github.com/wenzhilics/octopus.

### 2. [AeroSketch: Near-Optimal Time Matrix Sketch Framework for Persistent, Sliding Window, and Distributed Streams](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02019v1)

Authors: Hanyan Yin, Dongxie Wen, Jiajun Li, Zhewei Wei, Xiao Zhang, Peng Zhao, Zhi-Hua Zhou

Many real-world matrix datasets arrive as high-throughput vector streams, making it impractical to store or process them in their entirety. To enable real-time analytics under limited computational, memory, and communication resources, matrix sketching techniques have been developed over recent decades to provide compact approximations of such streaming data. Some algorithms have achieved optimal space and communication complexity. However, these approaches often require frequent time-consuming matrix factorization operations. In particular, under tight approximation error bounds, each matrix factorization computation incurs cubic time complexity, thereby limiting their update efficiency.
  In this paper, we introduce AeroSketch, a novel matrix sketching framework that leverages recent advances in randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA). AeroSketch achieves optimal communication and space costs while delivering near-optimal update time complexity (within logarithmic factors) across persistent, sliding window, and distributed streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AeroSketch consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in update throughput. In particular, under tight approximation error constraints, AeroSketch reduces the cubic time complexity to the quadratic level. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable approximation quality while retaining optimal communication and space costs.

### 3. [SafeLoad: Efficient Admission Control Framework for Identifying Memory-Overloading Queries in Cloud Data Warehouses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01888v1)

Authors: Yifan Wu, Yuhan Li, Zhenhua Wang, Zhongle Xie, Dingyu Yang, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou, Bo Tang, Liang Lin, Huan Li, Gang Chen

Memory overload is a common form of resource exhaustion in cloud data warehouses. When database queries fail due to memory overload, it not only wastes critical resources such as CPU time but also disrupts the execution of core business processes, as memory-overloading (MO) queries are typically part of complex workflows. If such queries are identified in advance and scheduled to memory-rich serverless clusters, it can prevent resource wastage and query execution failure. Therefore, cloud data warehouses desire an admission control framework with high prediction precision, interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability to effectively identify MO queries. However, existing admission control frameworks primarily focus on scenarios like SLA satisfaction and resource isolation, with limited precision in identifying MO queries. Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available MO-labeled datasets with workloads for training and benchmarking. To tackle these challenges, we propose SafeLoad, the first query admission control framework specifically designed to identify MO queries. Alongside, we release SafeBench, an open-source, industrial-scale benchmark for this task, which includes 150 million real queries. SafeLoad first filters out memory-safe queries using the interpretable discriminative rule. It then applies a hybrid architecture that integrates both a global model and cluster-level models, supplemented by a misprediction correction module to identify MO queries. Additionally, a self-tuning quota management mechanism dynamically adjusts prediction quotas per cluster to improve precision. Experimental results show that SafeLoad achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance with low online and offline time overhead. Specifically, SafeLoad improves precision by up to 66% over the best baseline and reduces wasted CPU time by up to 8.09x compared to scenarios without SafeLoad.

### 4. [Multivariate Time-series Anomaly Detection via Dynamic Model Pool & Ensembling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02037v1)

Authors: Wei Hu, Zewei Yu, Jianqiu Xu

Multivariate time-series (MTS) anomaly detection is critical in domains such as service monitor, IoT, and network security. While multi-model methods based on selection or ensembling outperform single-model ones, they still face limitations: (i) selection methods rely on a single chosen model and are sensitive to the strategy; (ii) ensembling methods often combine all models or are restricted to univariate data; and (iii) most methods depend on fixed data dimensionality, limiting scalability. To address these, we propose DMPEAD, a Dynamic Model Pool and Ensembling framework for MTS Anomaly Detection. The framework first (i) constructs a diverse model pool via parameter transfer and diversity metric, then (ii) updates it with a meta-model and similarity-based strategy for adaptive pool expansion, subset selection, and pool merging, finally (iii) ensembles top-ranked models through proxy metric ranking and top-k aggregation in the selected subset, outputting the final anomaly detection result. Extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets show that our model outperforms all baselines, demonstrating superior adaptability and scalability.

### 5. [Vector Search for the Future: From Memory-Resident, Static Heterogeneous Storage, to Cloud-Native Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01937v1)

Authors: Yitong Song, Xuanhe Zhou, Christian S. Jensen, Jianliang Xu

Vector search (VS) has become a fundamental component in multimodal data management, enabling core functionalities such as image, video, and code retrieval. As vector data scales rapidly, VS faces growing challenges in balancing search, latency, scalability, and cost. The evolution of VS has been closely driven by changes in storage architecture. Early VS methods rely on all-in-memory designs for low latency, but scalability is constrained by memory capacity and cost. To address this, recent research has adopted heterogeneous architectures that offload space-intensive vectors and index structures to SSDs, while exploiting block locality and I/O-efficient strategies to maintain high search performance at billion scale. Looking ahead, the increasing demand for trillion-scale vector retrieval and cloud-native elasticity is driving a further shift toward memory-SSD-object storage architectures, which enable cost-efficient data tiering and seamless scalability.
  In this tutorial, we review the evolution of VS techniques from a storage-architecture perspective. We first review memory-resident methods, covering classical IVF, hash, quantization, and graph-based designs. We then present a systematic overview of heterogeneous storage VS techniques, including their index designs, block-level layouts, query strategies, and update mechanisms. Finally, we examine emerging cloud-native systems and highlight open research opportunities for future large-scale vector retrieval systems.

### 6. [Beyond Homophily: Community Search on Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01703v1)

Authors: Qing Sima, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenjie Zhang

Community search aims to identify a refined set of nodes that are most relevant to a given query, supporting tasks ranging from fraud detection to recommendation. Unlike homophilic graphs, many real-world networks are heterophilic, where edges predominantly connect dissimilar nodes. Therefore, structural signals that once reflected smooth, low-frequency similarity now appear as sharp, high-frequency contrasts. However, both classical algorithms (e.g., k-core, k-truss) and recent ML-based models struggle to achieve effective community search on heterophilic graphs, where edge signs or semantics are generally unknown. Algorithm-based methods often return communities with mixed class labels, while GNNs, built on homophily, smooth away meaningful signals and blur community boundaries. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Community Search (AdaptCS), a unified framework featuring three key designs: (i) an AdaptCS Encoder that disentangles multi-hop and multi-frequency signals, enabling the model to capture both smooth (homophilic) and contrastive (heterophilic) relations; (ii) a memory-efficient low-rank optimization that removes the main computational bottleneck and ensures model scalability; and (iii) an Adaptive Community Score (ACS) that guides online search by balancing embedding similarity and topological relations. Extensive experiments on both heterophilic and homophilic benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptCS outperforms the best-performing baseline by an average of 11% in F1-score, retains robustness across heterophily levels, and achieves up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup.

### 1. [Bringing computation to the data: A MOEA-driven approach for optimising data processing in the context of the SKA and SRCNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01980v1)

Authors: Manuel Parra-Royón, Álvaro Rodríguez-Gallardo, Susana Sánchez-Expósito, Laura Darriba-Pol, Jesús Sánchez-Castañeda, M. Ángeles Mendoza, Julián Garrido, Javier Moldón, Lourdes Verdes-Montenegro

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will generate unprecedented data volumes, making efficient data processing a critical challenge. Within this context, the SKA Regional Centres Network (SRCNet) must operate in a near-exascale environment where traditional data-centric computing models based on moving large datasets to centralised resources are no longer viable due to network and storage bottlenecks.
  To address this limitation, this work proposes a shift towards distributed and in-situ computing, where computation is moved closer to the data. We explore the integration of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) with an intelligent decision-making entity based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to optimise data-intensive workflows within SRCNet. FaaS enables lightweight and modular function execution near data sources while abstracting infrastructure management.
  The proposed decision-making entity employs Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to explore near-optimal execution plans considering execution time and energy consumption, together with constraints related to data location and transfer costs. This work establishes a baseline framework for efficient and cost-aware computation-to-data strategies within the SRCNet architecture.

### 2. [pMSz: A Distributed Parallel Algorithm for Correcting Extrema and Morse Smale Segmentations in Lossy Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01787v1)

Authors: Yuxiao Li, Mingze Xia, Xin Liang, Bei Wang, Robert Underwood, Sheng Di, Hemant Sharma, Dishant Beniwal, Franck Cappello, Hanqi Guo

Lossy compression, widely used by scientists to reduce data from simulations, experiments, and observations, can distort features of interest even under bounded error. Such distortions may compromise downstream analyses and lead to incorrect scientific conclusions in applications such as combustion and cosmology. This paper presents a distributed and parallel algorithm for correcting topological features, specifically, piecewise linear Morse Smale segmentations (PLMSS), which decompose the domain into monotone regions labeled by their corresponding local minima and maxima. While a single GPU algorithm (MSz) exists for PLMSS correction after compression, no methodology has been developed that scales beyond a single GPU for extreme scale data. We identify the key bottleneck in scaling PLMSS correction as the parallel computation of integral paths, a communication-intensive computation that is notoriously difficult to scale. Instead of explicitly computing and correcting integral paths, our algorithm simplifies MSz by preserving steepest ascending and descending directions across all locations, thereby minimizing interprocess communication while introducing negligible additional storage overhead. With this simplified algorithm and relaxed synchronization, our method achieves over 90% parallel efficiency on 128 GPUs on the Perlmutter supercomputer for real world datasets.

Real-time recommender systems execute multi-stage cascades (retrieval, pre-processing, fine-grained ranking) under strict tail-latency SLOs, leaving only tens of milliseconds for ranking. Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads. We implement RelayGR on Huawei Ascend NPUs and evaluate it with real queries. Under a fixed P99 SLO, RelayGR supports up to 1.5$\times$ longer sequences and improves SLO-compliant throughput by up to 3.6$\times$.

Authors: Rahul Sengupta, Nooshin Yousefzadeh, Manav Sanghvi, Yash Ranjan, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka, Yashaswi Karnati, Jeremy Dilmore, Tushar Patel, Ryan Casburn

With growing urbanization worldwide, efficient management of traffic infrastructure is critical for transportation agencies and city planners. It is essential to have tools that help analyze large volumes of stored traffic data and make effective interventions. To address this need, we present ``BigSUMO", an end-to-end, scalable, open-source framework for analytics, interruption detection, and parallel traffic simulation. Our system ingests high-resolution loop detector and signal state data, along with sparse probe trajectory data. It first performs descriptive analytics and detects potential interruptions. It then uses the SUMO microsimulator for prescriptive analytics, testing hundreds of what-if scenarios to optimize traffic performance. The modular design allows integration of different algorithms for data processing and outlier detection. Built using open-source software and libraries, the pipeline is cost-effective, scalable, and easy to deploy. We hope BigSUMO will be a valuable aid in developing smart city mobility solutions.

### 5. [Deciding Serializability in Network Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02251v1)

Authors: Guy Amir, Mark Barbone, Nicolas Amat, Jules Jacobs

We present the SER modeling language for automatically verifying serializability of concurrent programs, i.e., whether every concurrent execution of the program is equivalent to some serial execution.
  SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps.
  Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace.
  We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query.
  Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation.
  We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.

### 6. [Vouchsafe: A Zero-Infrastructure Capability Graph Model for Offline Identity and Trust](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02254v1)

Authors: Jay Kuri

Modern identity and trust systems collapse in the environments where they are needed most: disaster zones, disconnected or damaged networks, and adversarial conditions such as censorship or infrastructure interference. These systems depend on functioning networks to reach online authorities, resolvers, directories, and revocation services, leaving trust unverifiable whenever communication is unavailable or untrusted. This work demonstrates that secure identity and trust are possible without such infrastructure. We introduce the Zero-Infrastructure Capability Graph (ZI-CG), a model showing that identity, delegation, and revocation can be represented as self-contained, signed statements whose validity is determined entirely by local, deterministic evaluation. We further present Vouchsafe, a complete working instantiation of this model built using widely deployed primitives including Ed25519, SHA-256, and structured JSON Web Tokens, requiring no new cryptography or online services. The results show that a practical, offline-verifiable trust substrate can be constructed today using only the cryptographic data presented at evaluation time.

### 7. [Placement Semantics for Distributed Deep Learning: A Systematic Framework for Analyzing Parallelism Strategies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02311v1)

Authors: Deep Pankajbhai Mehta

Training large language models requires distributing computation across many accelerators, yet practitioners select parallelism strategies (data, tensor, pipeline, ZeRO) through trial and error because no unified systematic framework predicts their behavior. We introduce placement semantics: each strategy is specified by how it places four training states (parameters, optimizer, gradients, activations) across devices using five modes (replicated, sharded, sharded-with-gather, materialized, offloaded). From placement alone, without implementation details, we derive memory consumption and communication volume. Our predictions match published results exactly: ZeRO-3 uses 8x less memory than data parallelism at 1.5x communication cost, as reported in the original paper. We prove two conditions (gradient integrity, state consistency) are necessary and sufficient for distributed training to match single-device results, and provide composition rules for combining strategies safely. The framework unifies ZeRO Stages 1-3, Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism as instances with different placement choices.

Authors: Abdullah Al Asif, Sixing Yu, Juan Pablo Munoz, Arya Mazaheri, Ali Jannesari

SplitFed Learning (SFL) combines federated learning and split learning to enable collaborative training across distributed edge devices; however, it faces significant challenges in heterogeneous environments with diverse computational and communication capabilities. This paper proposes \textit{SuperSFL}, a federated split learning framework that leverages a weight-sharing super-network to dynamically generate resource-aware client-specific subnetworks, effectively mitigating device heterogeneity. SuperSFL introduces Three-Phase Gradient Fusion (TPGF), an optimization mechanism that coordinates local updates, server-side computation, and gradient fusion to accelerate convergence. In addition, a fault-tolerant client-side classifier and collaborative client--server aggregation enable uninterrupted training under intermittent communication failures. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with up to 100 heterogeneous clients show that SuperSFL converges $2$--$5\times$ faster in terms of communication rounds than baseline SFL while achieving higher accuracy, resulting in up to $20\times$ lower total communication cost and $13\times$ shorter training time. SuperSFL also demonstrates improved energy efficiency compared to baseline methods, making it a practical solution for federated learning in heterogeneous edge environments.

Authors: Manav Seksaria, Anil Prabhakar

We extend quantum circuit cutting to heterogeneous registers comprising mixed-dimensional qudits. By decomposing non-local interactions into tensor products of local generalised Gell-Mann matrices, we enable the simulation and execution of high-dimensional circuits on disconnected hardware fragments. We validate this framework on qubit--qutrit ($2$--$3$) interfaces, achieving exact state reconstruction with a Total Variation Distance of 0 within single-precision floating-point tolerance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the memory advantage in an 8-particle, dimension-8 system, reducing memory usage from 128 MB to 64 KB per circuit.

### 10. [Tackling Resource-Constrained and Data-Heterogeneity in Federated Learning with Double-Weight Sparse Pack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01840v1)

Authors: Qiantao Yang, Liquan Chen, Mingfu Xue, Songze Li

Federated learning has drawn widespread interest from researchers, yet the data heterogeneity across edge clients remains a key challenge, often degrading model performance. Existing methods enhance model compatibility with data heterogeneity by splitting models and knowledge distillation. However, they neglect the insufficient communication bandwidth and computing power on the client, failing to strike an effective balance between addressing data heterogeneity and accommodating limited client resources. To tackle this limitation, we propose a personalized federated learning method based on cosine sparsification parameter packing and dual-weighted aggregation (FedCSPACK), which effectively leverages the limited client resources and reduces the impact of data heterogeneity on model performance. In FedCSPACK, the client packages model parameters and selects the most contributing parameter packages for sharing based on cosine similarity, effectively reducing bandwidth requirements. The client then generates a mask matrix anchored to the shared parameter package to improve the alignment and aggregation efficiency of sparse updates on the server. Furthermore, directional and distribution distance weights are embedded in the mask to implement a weighted-guided aggregation mechanism, enhancing the robustness and generalization performance of the global model. Extensive experiments across four datasets using ten state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that FedCSPACK effectively improves communication and computational efficiency while maintaining high model accuracy.

Authors: Haochen Dong, Sun Qiao, Yanping Mu, Lu Liao, Diogo Rodrigues, Frank Sauerburger, Yi Bu, Robin Haunschild

In this study, we systematically elucidate the background and functionality of the Scilit database and evaluate the feasibility and advantages of the comprehensive impact metrics I3 and I3/N, introduced within the Scilit framework. Using a matched dataset of 17,816 journals, we conduct a comparative analysis of Scilit I3/N, Journal Impact Factor, and CiteScore for 2023 and 2024, covering descriptive statistics and distributional characteristics from both disciplinary and publisher perspectives. The comparison reveals that the Scilit I3 and I3/N framework significantly outperforms traditional mean-based metrics in terms of coverage, methodological robustness, and disciplinary fairness. It provides a more accurate, diagnosable, and responsible solution for interdisciplinary journal impact assessment. Our research serves as a "getting started guide" for Scilit, offering scholars, librarians, and academic publishers in the fields of bibliometrics or scientometrics a valuable perspective for exploring I3 and I3/N within an inclusive database. This enables a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of disciplinary development and scientific progress. We advocate for piloting and validating this method in broader evaluation contexts to foster a more precise and diverse representation of scientific progress.

Authors: Biegzat Murat, Zhichao Fang, Ed Noyons, Rodrigo Costas

Overton, a global policy index, provides new opportunities to study the interactions between science and policy. This study aims to characterize the presence of scholarly and policy references in Overton-indexed policy documents and examine their distribution across key bibliographic dimensions, thereby assessing Overton's potential as a data source for policy metrics. We analyze a dataset of approximately 17.5 million policy documents from Overton, incorporating metadata such as publication year, policy source, country, language, subject area, and policy topic. Descriptive statistics are employed to assess the presence and distribution of reference data across these dimensions. Overton indexes a substantial volume of policy documents and identifies considerable reference data within them: 7.7% of documents contain scholarly references and 10.6% contain policy references. However, the presence of references varies significantly across publications years, source types, countries, languages, subject areas, and policy topics, indicating coverage biases that may affect interpretations of policy impact. The analysis is based on the Overton database as of June 2025. As Overton is regularly updated, the distribution patterns of indexed documents and references may evolve over time. The findings offer insights into the opportunities and constraints of using Overton for investigating evidence-based policymaking and for assessing the policy uptake of research outputs in the context of research evaluation. This is the first large-scale study to systematically examine the distribution of reference data in Overton. It contributes a foundational understanding of this emerging source for policy metrics, highlighting both its potential applications and limitations, and underlining the importance of addressing current coverage imbalances.

### 1. [Learning with Monotone Adversarial Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02193v1)

Authors: Kasper Green Larsen, Chirag Pabbaraju, Abhishek Shetty

We study the extent to which standard machine learning algorithms rely on exchangeability and independence of data by introducing a monotone adversarial corruption model. In this model, an adversary, upon looking at a "clean" i.i.d. dataset, inserts additional "corrupted" points of their choice into the dataset. These added points are constrained to be monotone corruptions, in that they get labeled according to the ground-truth target function. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that in this setting, all known optimal learning algorithms for binary classification can be made to achieve suboptimal expected error on a new independent test point drawn from the same distribution as the clean dataset. On the other hand, we show that uniform convergence-based algorithms do not degrade in their guarantees. Our results showcase how optimal learning algorithms break down in the face of seemingly helpful monotone corruptions, exposing their overreliance on exchangeability.

### 2. [Solving Matrix Games with Even Fewer Matrix-Vector Products](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02347v1)

Authors: Ishani Karmarkar, Liam O'Carroll, Aaron Sidford

We study the problem of computing an $ε$-approximate Nash equilibrium of a two-player, bilinear, zero-sum game with a bounded payoff matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, when the players' strategies are constrained to lie in simple sets. We provide algorithms which solve this problem in $\tilde{O}(ε^{-2/3})$ matrix-vector multiplies (matvecs) in two well-studied cases: $\ell_1$-$\ell_1$ games, where the players' strategies are both in the probability simplex, and $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$ games, where the players' strategies are in the unit Euclidean ball and probability simplex respectively. These results improve upon the previous state-of-the-art complexities of $\tilde{O}(ε^{-8/9})$ for $\ell_1$-$\ell_1$ and of $\tilde{O}(ε^{-7/9})$ for $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$ due to [KOS '25]. In particular, our result for $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$, which corresponds to hard-margin support vector machines (SVMs), matches the lower bound of [KS '25] up to polylogarithmic factors.

### 3. [Improved Approximation Algorithms for the Multiple-Depot Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01841v1)

Authors: Jingyang Zhao, Yonghang Su, Mingyu Xiao

The Multiple-Depot Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (MD-SDVRP) is a challenging problem with broad applications in logistics. The goal is to serve customers' demand using a fleet of capacitated vehicles located in multiple depots, where each customer's demand can be served by more than one vehicle, while minimizing the total travel cost of all vehicles. We study approximation algorithms for this problem. Previously, the only known result was a $6$-approximation algorithm for a constant number of depots (INFORMS J. Comput. 2023), and whether this ratio could be improved was left as an open question. In this paper, we resolve it by proposing a $(6-2\cdot 10^{-36})$-approximation algorithm for this setting. Moreover, we develop constant-factor approximation algorithms that work beyond a constant number of depots, improved parameterized approximation algorithms related to the vehicle capacity and the number of depots, as well as bi-factor approximation algorithms.

### 4. [Exact Clique Number Manipulation via Edge Interdiction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01869v1)

Authors: Yi Zhou, Haoyu Jiang, Chenghao Zhu, André Rossi

The Edge Interdiction Clique Problem (EICP) aims to remove at most $k$ edges from a graph so as to minimize the size of the largest clique in the remaining graph. This problem captures a fundamental question in graph manipulation: which edges are structurally critical for preserving large cliques? Such a problem is also motivated by practical applications including protein function maintenance and image matching. The EICP is computationally challenging and belongs to a complexity class beyond NP. Existing approaches rely on general mixed-integer bilevel programming solvers or reformulate the problem into a single-level mixed integer linear program. However, they are still not scalable when the graph size and interdiction budget $k$ grow. To overcome this, we investigate new mixed integer linear formulations, which recast the problem into a sequence of parameterized Edge Blocker Clique Problems (EBCP). This perspective decomposes the original problem into simpler subproblems and enables tighter modeling of clique-related inequalities. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage exact algorithm, \textsc{RLCM}, which first applies problem-specific reduction techniques to shrink the graph and then solves the reduced problem using a tailored branch-and-cut framework. Extensive computational experiments on maximum clique benchmark graphs, large real-world sparse networks, and random graphs demonstrate that \textsc{RLCM} consistently outperforms existing approaches.

### 5. [Improved Accuracy for Private Continual Cardinality Estimation in Fully Dynamic Streams via Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02257v1)

Authors: Joel Daniel Andersson, Palak Jain, Satchit Sivakumar

We study differentially-private statistics in the fully dynamic continual observation model, where many updates can arrive at each time step and updates to a stream can involve both insertions and deletions of an item. Earlier work (e.g., Jain et al., NeurIPS 2023 for counting distinct elements; Raskhodnikova & Steiner, PODS 2025 for triangle counting with edge updates) reduced the respective cardinality estimation problem to continual counting on the difference stream associated with the true function values on the input stream. In such reductions, a change in the original stream can cause many changes in the difference stream, this poses a challenge for applying private continual counting algorithms to obtain optimal error bounds. We improve the accuracy of several such reductions by studying the associated $\ell_p$-sensitivity vectors of the resulting difference streams and isolating their properties.
  We demonstrate that our framework gives improved bounds for counting distinct elements, estimating degree histograms, and estimating triangle counts (under a slightly relaxed privacy model), thus offering a general approach to private continual cardinality estimation in streaming settings. Our improved accuracy stems from tight analysis of known factorization mechanisms for the counting matrix in this setting; the key technical challenge is arguing that one can use state-of-the-art factorizations for sensitivity vector sets with the properties we isolate. Empirically and analytically, we demonstrate that our improved error bounds offer a substantial improvement in accuracy for cardinality estimation problems over a large range of parameters.

### 6. [Publishing Below-Threshold Triangle Counts under Local Weight Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01710v1)

Authors: Kevin Pfisterer, Quentin Hillebrand, Vorapong Suppakitpaisarn

We propose an algorithm for counting below-threshold triangles in weighted graphs under local weight differential privacy. While prior work focused on unweighted graphs, many real-world networks naturally include edge weights. We study the setting where the graph topology is public known and the privacy of the influence of an individual on the edge weights is protected. This captures realistic scenarios such as road networks and telecommunication networks. Our approach consists of two rounds of communication. In the first round, each node publishes their incident weight information under local weight differential privacy while in the second round, the nodes locally count below-threshold triangles, for which we introduce a biased and unbiased variant. We further propose two different improvements. We present a pre-computation step that reduces the covariance and thereby lowers the expected error. Secondly, we develop an algorithm for computing the smooth-sensitivity, which significantly reduces the running time compared to a straightforward approach. Finally, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the differences between the biased and unbiased variants and the effectiveness of the proposed improvements.

### 1. [Physics-Informed Deep Recurrent Back-Projection Network for Tunnel Propagation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02007v1)

Authors: Kunyu Wu, Qiushi Zhao, Jingyi Zhou, Junqiao Wang, Hao Qin, Xinyue Zhang, Xingqi Zhang

Accurate and efficient modeling of radio wave propagation in railway tunnels is is critical for ensuring reliable communication-based train control (CBTC) systems. Fine-grid parabolic wave equation (PWE) solvers provide high-fidelity field predictions but are computationally expensive for large-scale tunnels, whereas coarse-grid models lose essential modal and geometric details. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-informed recurrent back-projection propagation network (PRBPN) that reconstructs fine-resolution received-signal-strength (RSS) fields from coarse PWE slices. The network integrates multi-slice temporal fusion with an iterative projection/back-projection mechanism that enforces physical consistency and avoids any pre-upsampling stage, resulting in strong data efficiency and improved generalization. Simulations across four tunnel cross-section geometries and four frequencies show that the proposed PRBPN closely tracks fine-mesh PWE references. Engineering-level validation on the Massif Central tunnel in France further confirms robustness in data-scarce scenarios, trained with only a few paired coarse/fine RSS. These results indicate that the proposed PRBPN can substantially reduce reliance on computationally intensive fine-grid solvers while maintaining high-fidelity tunnel propagation predictions.

### 2. [Enhancing Object Detection with Privileged Information: A Model-Agnostic Teacher-Student Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02016v1)

Authors: Matthias Bartolo, Dylan Seychell, Gabriel Hili, Matthew Montebello, Carl James Debono, Saviour Formosa, Konstantinos Makantasis

This paper investigates the integration of the Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm in object detection to exploit fine-grained, descriptive information available during training but not at inference. We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs. The findings affirm that the LUPI framework provides an effective and practical strategy for advancing object detection systems in both resource-constrained and real-world settings.

Authors: Gabriel Timothy, Syeda Amna Rizvi, Muhammad Umair, Athman Bouguettaya, Balsam Alkouz

We present a novel investigation into the impact of inter-drone interference on delivery efficiencies within multi-drone skyway networks. We conduct controlled experiments to analyze the behavior of drones in an indoor testbed environment. Our study compares performance between solo flights and concurrent multi-drone operations along predefined routes. This analysis captures interference occurring during both flight and at charging stations, providing a comprehensive evaluation of its effects on overall network performance. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments across diverse scenarios to systematically understand and model the dynamics of inter-drone interference. Key metrics, such as power consumption and delivery times, are considered. This generates a comprehensive dataset for in-depth analysis of interference at both the node and segment levels. These findings are then formalized into a predictive model. The results validate the effectiveness of the developed model, demonstrating its potential to accurately forecast inter-drone interferences.

Authors: Vejaykarthy Srithar, Syeda Amna Rizvi, Amani Abusafia, Athman Bouguettaya, Balsam Alkouz

We demonstrate the peer-to-peer impact of drones flying in close proximity. Understanding these impacts is crucial for planning efficient drone delivery services. In this regard, we conducted a set of experiments using drones at varying positions in a 3D space under different wind conditions. We collected data on drone energy consumption traveling in a skyway segment. We developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that plots drone trajectories within a segment. The GUI facilitates analyzing the peer-to-peer influence of drones on their energy consumption. The analysis includes drones' positions, distance of separation, and wind impact.

Authors: Leon Müller, Adelina Bärligea, Alexander Knapp, Jakob S. Kottmann

Quantum computation is inherently hybrid, and fast classical manipulation of qubit operators is necessary to ensure scalability in quantum software. We introduce PauliEngine, a high-performance C++ framework that provides efficient primitives for Pauli string multiplication, commutators, symbolic phase tracking, and structural transformations. Built on a binary symplectic representation and optimized bit-wise operations, PauliEngine supports both numerical and symbolic coefficients and is accessible through a Python interface. Runtime benchmarks demonstrate substantial speedups over state-of-the-art implementations. PauliEngine provides a scalable backend for operator-based quantum software tools and simulations.

### Formal Languages and Automata Theory

### 1. [Deciding Serializability in Network Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02251v1)

Authors: Guy Amir, Mark Barbone, Nicolas Amat, Jules Jacobs

We present the SER modeling language for automatically verifying serializability of concurrent programs, i.e., whether every concurrent execution of the program is equivalent to some serial execution.
  SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps.
  Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace.
  We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query.
  Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation.
  We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.

### 2. [Context-Free Recognition with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01754v1)

Authors: Selim Jerad, Anej Svete, Sophie Hao, Ryan Cotterell, William Merrill

Transformers excel on tasks that process well-formed inputs according to some grammar, such as natural language and code. However, it remains unclear how they can process grammatical syntax. In fact, under standard complexity conjectures, standard transformers cannot recognize context-free languages (CFLs), a canonical formalism to describe syntax, or even regular languages, a subclass of CFLs (Merrill et al., 2022). Merrill & Sabharwal (2024) show that $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length $n$) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open. In this work, we show that looped transformers with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ looping layers and $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens can recognize all CFLs. However, training and inference with $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens is potentially impractical. Fortunately, we show that, for natural subclasses such as unambiguous CFLs, the recognition problem on transformers becomes more tractable, requiring $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ padding. We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms.

### 1. [SketchRodGS: Sketch-based Extraction of Slender Geometries for Animating Gaussian Splatting Scenes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02072v1)

Authors: Haato Watanabe, Nobuyuki Umetani

Physics simulation of slender elastic objects often requires discretization as a polyline. However, constructing a polyline from Gaussian splatting is challenging as Gaussian splatting lacks connectivity information and the configuration of Gaussian primitives contains much noise. This paper presents a method to extract a polyline representation of the slender part of the objects in a Gaussian splatting scene from the user's sketching input. Our method robustly constructs a polyline mesh that represents the slender parts using the screen-space shortest path analysis that can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several in-the-wild examples.

### 2. [Dancing Points: Synthesizing Ballroom Dancing with Three-Point Inputs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02096v1)

Authors: Peizhuo Li, Sebastian Starke, Yuting Ye, Olga Sorkine-Hornung

Ballroom dancing is a structured yet expressive motion category. Its highly diverse movement and complex interactions between leader and follower dancers make the understanding and synthesis challenging. We demonstrate that the three-point trajectory available from a virtual reality (VR) device can effectively serve as a dancer's motion descriptor, simplifying the modeling and synthesis of interplay between dancers' full-body motions down to sparse trajectories. Thanks to the low dimensionality, we can employ an efficient MLP network to predict the follower's three-point trajectory directly from the leader's three-point input for certain types of ballroom dancing, addressing the challenge of modeling high-dimensional full-body interaction. It also prevents our method from overfitting thanks to its compact yet explicit representation. By leveraging the inherent structure of the movements and carefully planning the autoregressive procedure, we show a deterministic neural network is able to translate three-point trajectories into a virtual embodied avatar, which is typically considered under-constrained and requires generative models for common motions. In addition, we demonstrate this deterministic approach generalizes beyond small, structured datasets like ballroom dancing, and performs robustly on larger, more diverse datasets such as LaFAN. Our method provides a computationally- and data-efficient solution, opening new possibilities for immersive paired dancing applications. Code and pre-trained models for this paper are available at https://peizhuoli.github.io/dancing-points.

### 2. [Metric Distortion with Preference Intensities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02095v1)

Authors: Mehrad Abbaszadeh, Ali Ansarifar, Mohamad Latifian, Masoud Seddighin

In voting with ranked ballots, each agent submits a strict ranking of the form $a \succ b \succ c \succ d$ over the alternatives, and the voting rule decides on the winner based on these rankings. Although this ballot format has desirable characteristics, there is a question of whether it is expressive enough for the agents. Kahng, Latifian, and Shah address this issue by adding intensities to the rankings. They introduce the ranking with intensities ballot format, where agents can use both $\succ\!\!\succ$ and $\succ$ in their rankings to express intensive and normal preferences between consecutive alternatives in their rankings. While they focus on analyzing this ballot format in the utilitarian distortion framework, in this work, we look at the potential of using this ballot format from the metric distortion viewpoint. We design a class of voting rules coined Positional Scoring Matching rules, which can be used for different problems in the metric setting, and show that by solving a zero-sum game, we can find the optimal member of this class for our problem. This rule takes intensities into account and achieves a distortion lower than $3$. In addition, by proving a bound on the price of ignoring intensities, we show that we might lose a great deal in terms of distortion by not taking the intensities into account.

### 1. [Realistic adversarial scenario generation via human-like pedestrian model for autonomous vehicle control parameter optimisation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02082v1)

Authors: Yueyang Wang, Mehmet Dogar, Gustav Markkula

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly advancing and are expected to play a central role in future mobility. Ensuring their safe deployment requires reliable interaction with other road users, not least pedestrians. Direct testing on public roads is costly and unsafe for rare but critical interactions, making simulation a practical alternative. Within simulation-based testing, adversarial scenarios are widely used to probe safety limits, but many prioritise difficulty over realism, producing exaggerated behaviours which may result in AV controllers that are overly conservative. We propose an alternative method, instead using a cognitively inspired pedestrian model featuring both inter-individual and intra-individual variability to generate behaviourally plausible adversarial scenarios. We provide a proof of concept demonstration of this method's potential for AV control optimisation, in closed-loop testing and tuning of an AV controller. Our results show that replacing the rule-based CARLA pedestrian with the human-like model yields more realistic gap acceptance patterns and smoother vehicle decelerations. Unsafe interactions occur only for certain pedestrian individuals and conditions, underscoring the importance of human variability in AV testing. Adversarial scenarios generated by this model can be used to optimise AV control towards safer and more efficient behaviour. Overall, this work illustrates how incorporating human-like road user models into simulation-based adversarial testing can enhance the credibility of AV evaluation and provide a practical basis to behaviourally informed controller optimisation.

Authors: Wei He, Xiang Li, Per Ola Kristensson, Ge Lin Kan

Virtual locomotion remains a challenge in VR, especially in space-limited environments where room-scale walking is impractical. We present LocoScooter, a low-cost, deployable locomotion interface combining foot-sliding on a compact treadmill with handlebar steering inspired by scooter riding. Built from commodity hardware, it supports embodied navigation through familiar, physically engaging movement. In a within-subject study (N = 14), LocoScooter significantly improved immersion, enjoyment, and bodily involvement over joystick navigation, while maintaining comparable efficiency and usability. Despite higher physical demand, users did not report increased fatigue, suggesting familiar movements can enrich VR navigation.

Authors: Manh-Dat Nguyen, Thomas Do, Nguyen Thanh Trung Le, Xuan-The Tran, Fred Chang, Chin-Teng Lin

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) enable users to interact with machines directly via neural activity, yet their real-world deployment is often hindered by bulky and powerhungry hardware. We present EdgeSSVEP, a fully embedded microcontroller-based Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) BCI platform that performs real-time EEG acquisition, zero-phase filtering, and on-device classification within a lowpower 240 MHz MCU operating at only 222 mW. The system incorporates an 8-channel EEG front end, supports 5-second stimulus durations, and executes the entire SSVEP decoding pipeline locally, eliminating dependence on PC-based processing. EdgeSSVEP was evaluated using six stimulus frequencies (7, 8, 9, 11, 7.5, and 8.5 Hz) with 10 participants. The device achieved 99.17% classification accuracy and 27.33 bits/min Information Transfer Rate (ITR), while consuming substantially less power than conventional desktop-based systems. The system integrates motion sensing to support artifact detection and improve robustness and signal stability in practical environments. For development and debugging, the system also provides optional TCP data streaming to external clients. Overall, EdgeSSVEP offers a scalable, energy-efficient, and secure embedded BCI platform suitable for assistive communication and neurofeedback applications, with potential extensions to accelerometer-based artifact mitigation and broader real-world deployments.

Authors: Daniel Hienert, Heiko Schmidt, Thomas Krämer, Dagmar Kern

Existing eye tracking software have certain limitations, especially with respect to monitoring reading online: (1) Most eye tracking software record eye tracking data as raw coordinates and stimuli as screen images/videos, but without inherent links between both. Analysts must draw areas of interest (AOIs) on webpage text for more fine-grained reading analysis. (2) The computation and analysis of fixation and reading metrics are done after the experiment and thus cannot be used for live applications. We present EyeLiveMetrics, a browser plugin that automatically maps raw gaze coordinates to text in real time. The plugin instantly calculates, stores, and provides fixation, saccade, and reading measures on words and paragraphs so that gaze behavior can be analyzed immediately. We also discuss the results of a comparative evaluation. EyeLiveMetrics offers a flexible way to measure reading on the web - for research experiments and live applications.

### 5. [From Metrics to Meaning: Insights from a Mixed-Methods Field Experiment on Retail Robot Deployment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01946v1)

Authors: Sichao Song, Yuki Okafuji, Takuya Iwamoto, Jun Baba, Hiroshi Ishiguro

We report a mixed-methods field experiment of a conversational service robot deployed under everyday staffing discretion in a live bedding store. Over 12 days we alternated three conditions--Baseline (no robot), Robot-only, and Robot+Fixture--and video-annotated the service funnel from passersby to purchase. An explanatory sequential design then used six post-experiment staff interviews to interpret the quantitative patterns.
  Quantitatively, the robot increased stopping per passerby (highest with the fixture), yet clerk-led downstream steps per stopper--clerk approach, store entry, assisted experience, and purchase--decreased. Interviews explained this divergence: clerks avoided interrupting ongoing robot-customer talk, struggled with ambiguous timing amid conversational latency, and noted child-centered attraction that often satisfied curiosity at the doorway. The fixture amplified visibility but also anchored encounters at the threshold, creating a well-defined micro-space where needs could ``close'' without moving inside.
  We synthesize these strands into an integrative account from the initial show of interest on the part of a customer to their entering the store and derive actionable guidance. The results advance the understanding of interactions between customers, staff members, and the robot and offer practical recommendations for deploying service robots in high-touch retail.

Authors: Manuela Chessa, Michela Chessa, Lorenzo Gerini, Matteo Martini, Kaloyana Naneva, Fabio Solari

Digital platforms increasingly support collective action initiatives, yet coordinating geographically dispersed users through digital interfaces remains challenging, particularly in threshold settings where success requires critical mass participation. This study investigates how avatar-based social representation in Virtual Reality (VR) influences coordination in threshold collective action problems. Through a randomized controlled experiment with 188 participants organized in 94 pairs, we examine whether brief avatar exposure affects perceived co-presence and coordination outcomes in a two-player threshold public goods game implemented as a real-effort recycling task. We manipulate a single design feature: participants either briefly interact through avatars before the main task (Pre-Task Avatar treatment) or complete an equivalent activity individually without peer visibility (No Pre-Task Avatar treatment). Our findings reveal that minimal avatar exposure significantly increases perceived co-presence and improves strategic coordination, though not through increased contribution quantity. Participants exposed to peer avatars achieve higher social welfare by coordinating to avoid wasteful over-contribution beyond the threshold. Additionally, we identify VR presence-the sense of 'being there' in the virtual environment-as a stronger predictor of task performance than co-presence itself. This research contributes to Information Systems theory by establishing causal pathways from specific design features to presence to coordination outcomes, demonstrates VR as a rigorous experimental methodology for IS research, and provides actionable insights for designing collaborative platforms supporting sustainability initiatives and threshold collective action problems.

### 7. [From Chat Control to Robot Control: The Backdoors Left Open for the Sake of Safety](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02205v1)

Authors: Neziha Akalin, Alberto Giaretta

This paper explores how a recent European Union proposal, the so-called Chat Control law, which creates regulatory incentives for providers to implement content detection and communication scanning, could transform the foundations of human-robot interaction (HRI). As robots increasingly act as interpersonal communication channels in care, education, and telepresence, they convey not only speech but also gesture, emotion, and contextual cues. We argue that extending digital surveillance laws to such embodied systems would entail continuous monitoring, embedding observation into the very design of everyday robots. This regulation blurs the line between protection and control, turning companions into potential informants. At the same time, monitoring mechanisms that undermine end-to-end encryption function as de facto backdoors, expanding the attack surface and allowing adversaries to exploit legally induced monitoring infrastructures. This creates a paradox of safety through insecurity: systems introduced to protect users may instead compromise their privacy, autonomy, and trust. This work does not aim to predict the future, but to raise awareness and help prevent certain futures from materialising.

### 8. [Escaping the Filter Bubble: Evaluating Electroencephalographic Theta Band Synchronization as Indicator for Selective Exposure in Online News Reading](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02047v1)

Authors: Thomas Krämer, Daniel Hienert, Francesco Chiossi, Thomas Kosch, Dagmar Kern

Selective exposure to online news occurs when users favor information that confirms their beliefs, creating filter bubbles and limiting diverse perspectives. Interactive systems can counter this by recommending different perspectives, but to achieve this, they need a real-time metric for selective exposure. We present an experiment where we evaluate Electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking as indicators for selective exposure by using eye tracking to recognize which textual parts participants read and using EEG to quantify the magnitude of selective exposure. Participants read online news while we collected EEG and eye movements with their agreement towards the news. We show that the agreement with news correlates positively with the theta band power in the parietal area. Our results indicate that future interactive systems can sense selective exposure using EEG and eye tracking to propose a more balanced information diet. This work presents an integrated experimental setup that identifies selective exposure using gaze and EEG-based metrics.

Authors: Lilu Cheng, Jingjun Lu, Yi Xuan Chan, Quoc Khai Nguyen, John Bi, Sean Ho

Claims documents are fundamental to healthcare and insurance operations, serving as the basis for reimbursement, auditing, and compliance. However, these documents are typically not born digital; they often exist as scanned PDFs or photographs captured under uncontrolled conditions. Consequently, they exhibit significant content heterogeneity, ranging from typed invoices to handwritten medical reports, as well as linguistic diversity. This challenge is exemplified by operations at Fullerton Health, which handles tens of millions of claims annually across nine markets, including Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, and Cambodia. Such variability, coupled with inconsistent image quality and diverse layouts, poses a significant obstacle to automated parsing and structured information extraction.
  This paper presents a robust multi-stage pipeline that integrates the multilingual optical character recognition (OCR) engine PaddleOCR, a traditional Logistic Regression classifier, and a compact Vision-Language Model (VLM), Qwen 2.5-VL-7B, to achieve efficient and accurate field extraction from large-scale claims data. The proposed system achieves a document-type classification accuracy of over 95 percent and a field-level extraction accuracy of approximately 87 percent, while maintaining an average processing latency of under 2 seconds per document. Compared to manual processing, which typically requires around 10 minutes per claim, our system delivers a 300x improvement in efficiency. These results demonstrate that combining traditional machine learning models with modern VLMs enables production-grade accuracy and speed for real-world automation. The solution has been successfully deployed in our mobile application and is currently processing tens of thousands of claims weekly from Vietnam and Singapore.

### 2. [MergeRec: Model Merging for Data-Isolated Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01753v1)

Authors: Hyunsoo Kim, Jaewan Moon, Seongmin Park, Jongwuk Lee

Modern recommender systems trained on domain-specific data often struggle to generalize across multiple domains. Cross-domain sequential recommendation has emerged as a promising research direction to address this challenge; however, existing approaches face fundamental limitations, such as reliance on overlapping users or items across domains, or unrealistic assumptions that ignore privacy constraints. In this work, we propose a new framework, MergeRec, based on model merging under a new and realistic problem setting termed data-isolated cross-domain sequential recommendation, where raw user interaction data cannot be shared across domains. MergeRec consists of three key components: (1) merging initialization, (2) pseudo-user data construction, and (3) collaborative merging optimization. First, we initialize a merged model using training-free merging techniques. Next, we construct pseudo-user data by treating each item as a virtual sequence in each domain, enabling the synthesis of meaningful training samples without relying on real user interactions. Finally, we optimize domain-specific merging weights through a joint objective that combines a recommendation loss, which encourages the merged model to identify relevant items, and a distillation loss, which transfers collaborative filtering signals from the fine-tuned source models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeRec not only preserves the strengths of the original models but also significantly enhances generalizability to unseen domains. Compared to conventional model merging methods, MergeRec consistently achieves superior performance, with average improvements of up to 17.21% in Recall@10, highlighting the potential of model merging as a scalable and effective approach for building universal recommender systems.

Authors: Nuo Chen, Hanpei Fang, Piaohong Wang, Jiqun Liu, Tetsuya Sakai, Xiao-Ming Wu

Recent studies have shown that prompting can enable large language models (LLMs) to simulate specific personality traits and produce behaviors that align with those traits. However, there is limited understanding of how these simulated personalities influence critical web search decisions, specifically relevance assessment. Moreover, few studies have examined how simulated personalities impact confidence calibration, specifically the tendencies toward overconfidence or underconfidence. This gap exists even though psychological literature suggests these biases are trait-specific, often linking high extraversion to overconfidence and high neuroticism to underconfidence. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive study evaluating multiple LLMs, including commercial models and open-source models, prompted to simulate Big Five personality traits. We tested these models across three test collections (TREC DL 2019, TREC DL 2020, and LLMJudge), collecting two key outputs for each query-document pair: a relevance judgment and a self-reported confidence score.
  The findings show that personalities such as low agreeableness consistently align more closely with human labels than the unprompted condition. Additionally, low conscientiousness performs well in balancing the suppression of both overconfidence and underconfidence. We also observe that relevance scores and confidence distributions vary systematically across different personalities. Based on the above findings, we incorporate personality-conditioned scores and confidence as features in a random forest classifier. This approach achieves performance that surpasses the best single-personality condition on a new dataset (TREC DL 2021), even with limited training data. These findings highlight that personality-derived confidence offers a complementary predictive signal, paving the way for more reliable and human-aligned LLM evaluators.

### 4. [When Attention Becomes Exposure in Generative Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01750v1)

Authors: Shayan Alipour, Mehdi Kargar, Morteza Zihayat

Generative search engines are reshaping information access by replacing traditional ranked lists with synthesized answers and references. In parallel, with the growth of Web3 platforms, incentive-driven creator ecosystems have become an essential part of how enterprises build visibility and community by rewarding creators for contributing to shared narratives. However, the extent to which exposure in generative search engine citations is shaped by external attention markets remains uncertain. In this study, we audit the exposure for 44 Web3 enterprises. First, we show that the creator community around each enterprise is persistent over time. Second, enterprise-specific queries reveal that more popular voices systematically receive greater citation exposure than others. Third, we find that larger follower bases and enterprises with more concentrated creator cores are associated with higher-ranked exposure. Together, these results show that generative search engine citations exhibit exposure bias toward already prominent voices, which risks entrenching incumbents and narrowing viewpoint diversity.

### 5. [Exploring Approaches for Detecting Memorization of Recommender System Data in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02002v1)

Authors: Antonio Colacicco, Vito Guida, Dario Di Palma, Fedelucio Narducci, Tommaso Di Noia

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommendation scenarios due to their strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, they are trained on vast corpora whose contents are not publicly disclosed, raising concerns about data leakage. Recent work has shown that the MovieLens-1M dataset is memorized by both the LLaMA and OpenAI model families, but the extraction of such memorized data has so far relied exclusively on manual prompt engineering. In this paper, we pose three main questions: Is it possible to enhance manual prompting? Can LLM memorization be detected through methods beyond manual prompting? And can the detection of data leakage be automated? To address these questions, we evaluate three approaches: (i) jailbreak prompt engineering; (ii) unsupervised latent knowledge discovery, probing internal activations via Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) and Cluster-Norm; and (iii) Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE), which frames prompt discovery as a meta-learning process that iteratively refines candidate instructions. Experiments on MovieLens-1M using LLaMA models show that jailbreak prompting does not improve the retrieval of memorized items and remains inconsistent; CCS reliably distinguishes genuine from fabricated movie titles but fails on numerical user and rating data; and APE retrieves item-level information with moderate success yet struggles to recover numerical interactions. These findings suggest that automatically optimizing prompts is the most promising strategy for extracting memorized samples.

Authors: Dario Di Palma, Giovanni Maria Biancofiore, Vito Walter Anelli, Fedelucio Narducci, Tommaso Di Noia

ChatGPT has emerged as a versatile tool, demonstrating capabilities across diverse domains. Given these successes, the Recommender Systems (RSs) community has begun investigating its applications within recommendation scenarios primarily focusing on accuracy. While the integration of ChatGPT into RSs has garnered significant attention, a comprehensive analysis of its performance across various dimensions remains largely unexplored. Specifically, the capabilities of providing diverse and novel recommendations or exploring potential biases such as popularity bias have not been thoroughly examined. As the use of these models continues to expand, understanding these aspects is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and achieving long-term personalization.
  This study investigates the recommendations provided by ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 by assessing ChatGPT's capabilities in terms of diversity, novelty, and popularity bias. We evaluate these models on three distinct datasets and assess their performance in Top-N recommendation and cold-start scenarios. The findings reveal that ChatGPT-4 matches or surpasses traditional recommenders, demonstrating the ability to balance novelty and diversity in recommendations. Furthermore, in the cold-start scenario, ChatGPT models exhibit superior performance in both accuracy and novelty, suggesting they can be particularly beneficial for new users. This research highlights the strengths and limitations of ChatGPT's recommendations, offering new perspectives on the capacity of these models to provide recommendations beyond accuracy-focused metrics.

Authors: Matteo Esposito, Andrea Janes, Valentina Lenarduzzi, Davide Taibi

In the early 1980s, Open Source Software emerged as a revolutionary concept amidst the dominance of proprietary software. What began as a revolutionary idea has now become the cornerstone of computer science. Amidst OSS projects, AI is increasing its presence and relevance. However, despite the growing popularity of AI, its adoption and impacts on OSS projects remain underexplored.
  We aim to assess the adoption of AI libraries in Python and Java OSS projects and examine how they shape development, including the technical ecosystem and community engagement. To this end, we will perform a large-scale analysis on 157.7k potential OSS repositories, employing repository metrics and software metrics to compare projects adopting AI libraries against those that do not. We expect to identify measurable differences in development activity, community engagement, and code complexity between OSS projects that adopt AI libraries and those that do not, offering evidence-based insights into how AI integration reshapes software development practices.

Authors: Mikel Robredo, Matteo Esposito, Fabio Palomba, Rafael Peñaloza, Valentina Lenarduzzi

Background. Defect prediction has been a highly active topic among researchers in the Empirical Software Engineering field. Previous literature has successfully achieved the most accurate prediction of an incoming fault and identified the features and anomalies that precede it through just-in-time prediction. As software systems evolve continuously, there is a growing need for time-sensitive methods capable of forecasting defects before they manifest.
  Aim. Our study seeks to explore the effectiveness of time-sensitive techniques for defect forecasting. Moreover, we aim to investigate the early indicators that precede the occurrence of a defect.
  Method. We will train multiple time-sensitive forecasting techniques to forecast the future bug density of a software project, as well as identify the early symptoms preceding the occurrence of a defect.
  Expected results. Our expected results are translated into empirical evidence on the effectiveness of our approach for early estimation of bug proneness.

### 9. [Cold-Starting Podcast Ads and Promotions with Multi-Task Learning on Spotify](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02306v1)

Authors: Shivam Verma, Hannes Karlbom, Yu Zhao, Nick Topping, Vivian Chen, Kieran Stanley, Bharath Rengarajan

We present a unified multi-objective model for targeting both advertisements and promotions within the Spotify podcast ecosystem. Our approach addresses key challenges in personalization and cold-start initialization, particularly for new advertising objectives. By leveraging transfer learning from large-scale ad and content interactions within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, a single joint model can be fine-tuned or directly applied to new or low-data targeting tasks, including in-app promotions. This multi-objective design jointly optimizes podcast outcomes such as streams, clicks, and follows for both ads and promotions using a shared representation over user, content, context, and creative features, effectively supporting diverse business goals while improving user experience. Online A/B tests show up to a 22% reduction in effective Cost-Per-Stream (eCPS), particularly for less-streamed podcasts, and an 18-24% increase in podcast stream rates. Offline experiments and ablations highlight the contribution of ancillary objectives and feature groups to cold-start performance. Our experience shows that a unified modeling strategy improves maintainability, cold-start performance, and coverage, while breaking down historically siloed targeting pipelines. We discuss practical trade-offs of such joint models in a real-world advertising system.

### 10. [ARIES: A Scalable Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework for Real-Time Epidemiological Surveillance and Outbreak Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01831v1)

Authors: Aniket Wattamwar, Sampson Akwafuo

Global health surveillance is currently facing a challenge of Knowledge Gaps. While general-purpose AI has proliferated, it remains fundamentally unsuited for the high-stakes epidemiological domain due to chronic hallucinations and an inability to navigate specialized data silos. This paper introduces ARIES (Agentic Retrieval Intelligence for Epidemiological Surveillance), a specialized, autonomous multi-agent framework designed to move beyond static, disease-specific dashboards toward a dynamic intelligence ecosystem. Built on a hierarchical command structure, ARIES utilizes GPTs to orchestrate a scalable swarm of sub-agents capable of autonomously querying World Health Organization (WHO), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and peer-reviewed research papers. By automating the extraction and logical synthesis of surveillance data, ARIES provides a specialized reasoning that identifies emergent threats and signal divergence in near real-time. This modular architecture proves that a task-specific agentic swarm can outperform generic models, offering a robust, extensible for next-generation outbreak response and global health intelligence.

### 1. [Learning with Monotone Adversarial Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02193v1)

Authors: Kasper Green Larsen, Chirag Pabbaraju, Abhishek Shetty

We study the extent to which standard machine learning algorithms rely on exchangeability and independence of data by introducing a monotone adversarial corruption model. In this model, an adversary, upon looking at a "clean" i.i.d. dataset, inserts additional "corrupted" points of their choice into the dataset. These added points are constrained to be monotone corruptions, in that they get labeled according to the ground-truth target function. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that in this setting, all known optimal learning algorithms for binary classification can be made to achieve suboptimal expected error on a new independent test point drawn from the same distribution as the clean dataset. On the other hand, we show that uniform convergence-based algorithms do not degrade in their guarantees. Our results showcase how optimal learning algorithms break down in the face of seemingly helpful monotone corruptions, exposing their overreliance on exchangeability.

### 2. [Crafting Adversarial Inputs for Large Vision-Language Models Using Black-Box Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01747v1)

Authors: Jiwei Guan, Haibo Jin, Haohan Wang

Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown groundbreaking capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs

Authors: Ziheng Chen, Minxuan Hu, Jiayu Yi, Wenxi Sun

We extend the Q-learner in Black-Scholes (QLBS) framework by incorporating risk aversion and trading costs, and propose a novel Replication Learning of Option Pricing (RLOP) approach. Both methods are fully compatible with standard reinforcement learning algorithms and operate under market frictions. Using SPY and XOP option data, we evaluate performance along static and dynamic dimensions. Adaptive-QLBS achieves higher static pricing accuracy in implied volatility space, while RLOP delivers superior dynamic hedging performance by reducing shortfall probability. These results highlight the importance of evaluating option pricing models beyond static fit, emphasizing realized hedging outcomes.

### 4. [A Differentiable Adversarial Framework for Task-Aware Data Subsampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02081v1)

Authors: Jiacheng Lyu, Bihua Bao

The proliferation of large-scale datasets poses a major computational challenge to model training. The traditional data subsampling method works as a static, task independent preprocessing step which usually discards information that is critical to downstream prediction. In this paper, we introduces the antagonistic soft selection subsampling (ASSS) framework as is a novel paradigm that reconstructs data reduction into a differentiable end-to-end learning problem. ASSS uses the adversarial game between selector network and task network, and selector network learning assigns continuous importance weights to samples. This direct optimization implemented by Gumbel-Softmax relaxation allows the selector to identify and retain samples with the maximum amount of information for a specific task target under the guidance of the loss function that balances the fidelity and sparsity of the prediction. Theoretical analysis links this framework with the information bottleneck principle. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale real world datasets show that ASSS has always been better than heuristic subsampling baselines such as clustering and nearest neighbor thinning in maintaining model performance. It is worth noting that ASSS can not only match, but also sometimes exceed the training performance of the entire dataset, showcasing the effect of intelligent denoising. This work establishes task aware data subsampling as a learnable component, providing a principled solution for effective large-scale data learning.

### 5. [GDRO: Group-level Reward Post-training Suitable for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02036v1)

Authors: Yiyang Wang, Xi Chen, Xiaogang Xu, Yu Liu, Hengshuang Zhao

Recent advancements adopt online reinforcement learning (RL) from LLMs to text-to-image rectified flow diffusion models for reward alignment. The use of group-level rewards successfully aligns the model with the targeted reward. However, it faces challenges including low efficiency, dependency on stochastic samplers, and reward hacking. The problem is that rectified flow models are fundamentally different from LLMs: 1) For efficiency, online image sampling takes much more time and dominates the time of training. 2) For stochasticity, rectified flow is deterministic once the initial noise is fixed. Aiming at these problems and inspired by the effects of group-level rewards from LLMs, we design Group-level Direct Reward Optimization (GDRO). GDRO is a new post-training paradigm for group-level reward alignment that combines the characteristics of rectified flow models. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we point out that GDRO supports full offline training that saves the large time cost for image rollout sampling. Also, it is diffusion-sampler-independent, which eliminates the need for the ODE-to-SDE approximation to obtain stochasticity. We also empirically study the reward hacking trap that may mislead the evaluation, and involve this factor in the evaluation using a corrected score that not only considers the original evaluation reward but also the trend of reward hacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDRO effectively and efficiently improves the reward score of the diffusion model through group-wise offline optimization across the OCR and GenEval tasks, while demonstrating strong stability and robustness in mitigating reward hacking.

### 6. [Output Embedding Centering for Stable LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02031v1)

Authors: Felix Stollenwerk, Anna Lokrantz, Niclas Hertzberg

Pretraining of large language models is not only expensive but also prone to certain training instabilities. A specific instability that often occurs for large learning rates at the end of training is output logit divergence. The most widely used mitigation strategy, z-loss, merely addresses the symptoms rather than the underlying cause of the problem. In this paper, we analyze the instability from the perspective of the output embeddings' geometry and identify its cause. Based on this, we propose output embedding centering (OEC) as a new mitigation strategy, and prove that it suppresses output logit divergence. OEC can be implemented in two different ways, as a deterministic operation called μ-centering, or a regularization method called μ-loss. Our experiments show that both variants outperform z-loss in terms of training stability and learning rate sensitivity. In particular, they ensure that training converges even for large learning rates when z-loss fails. Furthermore, we find that μ-loss is significantly less sensitive to regularization hyperparameter tuning than z-loss.

### 7. [TopoLoRA-SAM: Topology-Aware Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of Foundation Segmenters for Thin-Structure and Cross-Domain Binary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02273v1)

Authors: Salim Khazem

Foundation segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit strong zero-shot generalization through large-scale pretraining, but adapting them to domain-specific semantic segmentation remains challenging, particularly for thin structures (e.g., retinal vessels) and noisy modalities (e.g., SAR imagery). Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose \textbf{TopoLoRA-SAM}, a topology-aware and parameter-efficient adaptation framework for binary semantic segmentation. TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former. TopoLoRA-SAM achieves the best retina-average Dice and the best overall average Dice across datasets, while training only \textbf{5.2\%} of model parameters ($\sim$4.9M). On the challenging CHASE\_DB1 dataset, our method substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating that topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models.

### 8. [ELLA: Efficient Lifelong Learning for Adapters in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02232v1)

Authors: Shristi Das Biswas, Yue Zhang, Anwesan Pal, Radhika Bhargava, Kaushik Roy

Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer severe catastrophic forgetting when adapted sequentially to new tasks in a continual learning (CL) setting. Existing approaches are fundamentally limited: replay-based methods are impractical and privacy-violating, while strict orthogonality-based methods collapse under scale: each new task is projected onto an orthogonal complement, progressively reducing the residual degrees of freedom and eliminating forward transfer by forbidding overlap in shared representations. In this work, we introduce ELLA, a training framework built on the principle of selective subspace de-correlation. Rather than forbidding all overlap, ELLA explicitly characterizes the structure of past updates and penalizes alignments along their high-energy, task-specific directions, while preserving freedom in the low-energy residual subspaces to enable transfer. Formally, this is realized via a lightweight regularizer on a single aggregated update matrix. We prove this mechanism corresponds to an anisotropic shrinkage operator that bounds interference, yielding a penalty that is both memory- and compute-constant regardless of task sequence length. ELLA requires no data replay, no architectural expansion, and negligible storage. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art CL performance on three popular benchmarks, with relative accuracy gains of up to $9.6\%$ and a $35\times$ smaller memory footprint. Further, ELLA scales robustly across architectures and actively enhances the model's zero-shot generalization performance on unseen tasks, establishing a principled and scalable solution for constructive lifelong LLM adaptation.

### 9. [ACDZero: Graph-Embedding-Based Tree Search for Mastering Automated Cyber Defense](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02196v1)

Authors: Yu Li, Sizhe Tang, Rongqian Chen, Fei Xu Yu, Guangyu Jiang, Mahdi Imani, Nathaniel D. Bastian, Tian Lan

Automated cyber defense (ACD) seeks to protect computer networks with minimal or no human intervention, reacting to intrusions by taking corrective actions such as isolating hosts, resetting services, deploying decoys, or updating access controls. However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines.

### 10. [Moments Matter:Stabilizing Policy Optimization using Return Distributions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01803v1)

Authors: Dennis Jabs, Aditya Mohan, Marius Lindauer

Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often learn policies that achieve the same episodic return yet behave very differently, due to a combination of environmental (random transitions, initial conditions, reward noise) and algorithmic (minibatch selection, exploration noise) factors. In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(θ)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $θ$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(θ)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(θ)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(θ)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(θ)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns.

Authors: N. Sukumar, Ritwick Roy

In this paper, we present a Wachspress-based transfinite formulation on convex polygonal domains for exact enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions in physics-informed neural networks. This approach leverages prior advances in geometric design such as blending functions and transfinite interpolation over convex domains. For prescribed Dirichlet boundary function $\mathcal{B}$, the transfinite interpolant of $\mathcal{B}$, $g : \bar P \to C^0(\bar P)$, $\textit{lifts}$ functions from the boundary of a two-dimensional polygonal domain to its interior. The trial function is expressed as the difference between the neural network's output and the extension of its boundary restriction into the interior of the domain, with $g$ added to it. This ensures kinematic admissibility of the trial function in the deep Ritz method. Wachspress coordinates for an $n$-gon are used in the transfinite formula, which generalizes bilinear Coons transfinite interpolation on rectangles to convex polygons. The neural network trial function has a bounded Laplacian, thereby overcoming a limitation in a previous contribution where approximate distance functions were used to exactly enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions. For a point $\boldsymbol{x} \in \bar{P}$, Wachspress coordinates, $\boldsymbolλ : \bar P \to [0,1]^n$, serve as a geometric feature map for the neural network: $\boldsymbolλ$ encodes the boundary edges of the polygonal domain. This offers a framework for solving problems on parametrized convex geometries using neural networks. The accuracy of physics-informed neural networks and deep Ritz is assessed on forward, inverse, and parametrized geometric Poisson boundary-value problems.

Authors: SB Danush Vikraman, Hannah Abagail, Prasanna Kesavraj, Gajanan V Honnavar

We present Yukthi Opus (YO), a multi-chain hybrid metaheuristic designed for NP-hard optimization under explicit evaluation budget constraints. YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization.
  We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction. Overall, YO achieves competitive performance on large and multimodal problems while maintaining predictable evaluation budgets, making it suitable for expensive black-box optimization settings.

Authors: Francisco Angulo de Lafuente, Vladimir Veselov, Richard Goodman

We propose a theoretical framework--Holographic Reservoir Computing (HRC)--which hypothesizes that the thermodynamic noise and timing dynamics in voltage-stressed Bitcoin mining ASICs (BM1366) could potentially serve as a physical reservoir computing substrate. We present the CHIMERA (Conscious Hybrid Intelligence via Miner-Embedded Resonance Architecture) system architecture, which treats the SHA-256 hashing pipeline not as an entropy source, but as a deterministic diffusion operator whose timing characteristics under controlled voltage and frequency conditions may exhibit computationally useful dynamics. We report preliminary observations of non-Poissonian variability in inter-arrival time statistics during edge-of-stability operation, which we term the "Silicon Heartbeat" hypothesis. Theoretical analysis based on Hierarchical Number System (HNS) representations suggests that such architectures could achieve O(log n) energy scaling compared to traditional von Neumann O(2^n) dependencies. However, we emphasize that these are theoretical projections requiring experimental validation. We present the implemented measurement infrastructure, acknowledge current limitations, and outline the experimental program necessary to confirm or refute these hypotheses. This work contributes to the emerging field of thermodynamic computing by proposing a novel approach to repurposing obsolete cryptographic hardware for neuromorphic applications.

### 4. [SerpentFlow: Generative Unpaired Domain Alignment via Shared-Structure Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01979v1)

Authors: Julie Keisler, Anastase Alexandre Charantonis, Yannig Goude, Boutheina Oueslati, Claire Monteleoni

Domain alignment refers broadly to learning correspondences between data distributions from distinct domains. In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment.

To enhance the coverage rate of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), this paper proposes an advanced optimization strategy based on a multi-strategy integrated Northern Goshawk Optimization (NGO) algorithm. Specifically, multivariate chaotic mapping is first employed to improve the randomness and uniformity of the initial population. To further bolster population diversity and prevent the algorithm from stagnating in local optima, a bidirectional population evolutionary dynamics strategy is incorporated following the pursuit-and-evasion phase, thereby facilitating the attainment of the global optimal solution. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-strategy NGO in WSN coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of both coverage enhancement and node connectivity.

Authors: Henok Daniel, Omar Alhussein, Jie Liang, Cheng Li, Ernesto Damiani

The network data analytics function (NWDAF) has been introduced in the fifth-generation (5G) core standards to enable event-driven analytics and support intelligent network automation. However, existing implementations remain largely proprietary, and open-source alternatives lack comprehensive support for end-to-end event subscription and notification. In this paper, we present an open source NWDAF framework integrated into an existing Free5GC implementation, which serves as an open-source 5G core implementation. Our implementation extends the session management function to support standardized event exposure interfaces and introduces custom-built notification mechanisms into the SMF and the access and mobility management function for seamless data delivery. The NWDAF subscribes to events and generates analytics on user equipment (UE) behavior, session lifecycle, and handover dynamics. We validate our system through a two-week deployment involving four virtual next-generation NodeBs (gNBs) and multiple virtual UEs with dynamic mobility patterns. To demonstrate predictive capabilities, we incorporate a mobility-aware module that achieves 80.65\% accuracy in forecasting the next gNB handover cell. The framework supports reliable UE registration, state tracking, and cross-cell handovers.

Authors: Shunpu Tang, Yuanyuan Jia, Zijiu Yang, Qianqian Yang, Ruichen Zhang, Jun Du, Jihong Park, Zhiguo Shi, Khaled B. Letaief

Semantic communication (SemCom) improves communication efficiency by transmitting task-relevant information instead of raw bits and is expected to be a key technology for 6G networks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI) further enhance SemCom by enabling robust semantic encoding and decoding under limited channel conditions. However, these efficiency gains also introduce new security and privacy vulnerabilities. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, eavesdroppers can also use powerful GenAI-based semantic decoders to recover private information from intercepted signals. Moreover, rapid advances in agentic AI enable eavesdroppers to perform long-term and adaptive inference through the integration of memory, external knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. This allows eavesdroppers to further infer user private behavior and intent beyond the transmitted content. Motivated by these emerging challenges, this paper comprehensively rethinks the security and privacy of SemCom systems in the age of generative and agentic AI. We first present a systematic taxonomy of eavesdropping threat models in SemCom systems. Then, we provide insights into how GenAI and agentic AI can enhance eavesdropping threats. Meanwhile, we also highlight potential opportunities for leveraging GenAI and agentic AI to design privacy-preserving SemCom systems.

Authors: Runze Zheng, Yuqing Zheng, Zhengyi Cheng, Long Luo, Haoxiang Luo, Gang Sun, Hongfang Yu, Dusit Niyato

The Internet of Agents is propelling edge computing toward agentic AI and edge general intelligence (EGI). However, deploying multi-agent service (MAS) on resource-constrained edge infrastructure presents severe challenges. MAS service workflows are driven by complex cross-node interactions, dynamic memory accumulation, and collaborative tool usage. Exhibiting chain-like topological dependencies and strict affinity constraints, these workflows demand real-time responsiveness that exceeds the capabilities of traditional VNE algorithms designed for static resources. To address this, we propose AgentVNE, a cloud-edge collaborative framework utilizing a dual-layer architecture. First, AgentVNE employs a large language model (LLM) to identify implicit semantic constraints and generate affinity-based resource augmentation to resolve physical dependency issues. Second, it constructs a resource similarity-aware neural network, utilizing a pre-training and PPO fine-tuning strategy to precisely capture topological similarities between dynamic workflows and heterogeneous networks. By coupling semantic perception with topological reasoning, this mechanism effectively bridges the gap between dynamic service requirements and physical infrastructure. Simulation results demonstrate that AgentVNE reduces workflow communication latency to less than 40% of baselines and improves the service acceptance rate by approximately 5%-10% under high-load scenarios. Ultimately, this work provides a foundational solution for the semantic-aware deployment of agentic AI.

Authors: Matteo Bordin, Andrea Lacava, Michele Polese, Francesca Cuomo, Tommaso Melodia

The growing performance demands and higher deployment densities of next-generation wireless systems emphasize the importance of adopting strategies to manage the energy efficiency of mobile networks. In this demo, we showcase a framework that enables research on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for improving the energy efficiency of intelligent and programmable Open Radio Access Network (RAN) systems. Using the open-source simulator ns-O-RAN and the reinforcement learning environment Gymnasium, the framework enables to train and evaluate DRL agents that dynamically control the activation and deactivation of cells in a 5G network. We show how to collect data for training and evaluate the impact of DRL on energy efficiency in a realistic 5G network scenario, including users' mobility and handovers, a full protocol stack, and 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant channel models. The tool will be open-sourced and a tutorial for energy efficiency testing in ns-O-RAN.

### 5. [Near-Field Multi-Cell ISCAP with Extremely Large-Scale Antenna Array](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01968v1)

Authors: Yuan Guo, Yilong Chen, Zixiang Ren, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Jie Xu

This paper investigates a coordinated multi-cell integrated sensing, communication, and powering (ISCAP) system operating in the electromagnetic near field, where each base station (BS) employs an extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) to simultaneously support downlink communication, wireless power transfer (WPT), and environmental sensing. Three categories of communication users (CUs) with different interference cancellation capabilities are considered, and sensing is enabled through a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar architecture. To address the resulting design challenges, a robust optimization framework is proposed by optimizing the beamforming strategy to maximize the worst-case detection probability over a prescribed sensing region, subject to per-user signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and energy harvesting requirements at energy receivers (ERs), while explicitly capturing the uncertainty in ER locations. By leveraging semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the original non-convex problem is reformulated as a convex semidefinite program with a provably tight relaxation. Furthermore, a low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT)-based suboptimal scheme is developed, yielding a closed-form solution in the asymptotic regime as the number of antenna elements approaches infinity. Extensive numerical results reveal the fundamental trade-offs among sensing accuracy, communication reliability, and WPT efficiency.

Authors: Wenhui Chu, Aobo Jin, Hardik A. Gohel

Designing a robotic system that functions effectively within the specific environment of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner requires solving numerous technical issues, such as maintaining the robot's precision and stability under strong magnetic fields. This research focuses on enhancing MRI's role in medical imaging, especially in its application to guide intravascular interventions using robot-assisted devices. A newly developed computational system is introduced, designed for seamless integration with the MRI scanner, including a computational unit and user interface. This system processes MR images to delineate the vascular network, establishing virtual paths and boundaries within vessels to prevent procedural damage. Key findings reveal the system's capability to create tailored magnetic field gradient patterns for device control, considering the vessel's geometry and safety norms, and adapting to different blood flow characteristics for finer navigation. Additionally, the system's modeling aspect assesses the safety and feasibility of navigating pre-set vascular paths. Conclusively, this system, based on the Qt framework and C/C++, with specialized software modules, represents a major step forward in merging imaging technology with robotic aid, significantly enhancing precision and safety in intravascular procedures.

### 2. [Explicit World Models for Reliable Human-Robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01705v1)

Authors: Kenneth Kwok, Basura Fernando, Qianli Xu, Vigneshwaran Subbaraju, Dongkyu Choi, Boon Kiat Quek

This paper addresses the topic of robustness under sensing noise, ambiguous instructions, and human-robot interaction. We take a radically different tack to the issue of reliable embodied AI: instead of focusing on formal verification methods aimed at achieving model predictability and robustness, we emphasise the dynamic, ambiguous and subjective nature of human-robot interactions that requires embodied AI systems to perceive, interpret, and respond to human intentions in a manner that is consistent, comprehensible and aligned with human expectations. We argue that when embodied agents operate in human environments that are inherently social, multimodal, and fluid, reliability is contextually determined and only has meaning in relation to the goals and expectations of humans involved in the interaction. This calls for a fundamentally different approach to achieving reliable embodied AI that is centred on building and updating an accessible "explicit world model" representing the common ground between human and AI, that is used to align robot behaviours with human expectations.

### 3. [Realistic adversarial scenario generation via human-like pedestrian model for autonomous vehicle control parameter optimisation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02082v1)

Authors: Yueyang Wang, Mehmet Dogar, Gustav Markkula

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly advancing and are expected to play a central role in future mobility. Ensuring their safe deployment requires reliable interaction with other road users, not least pedestrians. Direct testing on public roads is costly and unsafe for rare but critical interactions, making simulation a practical alternative. Within simulation-based testing, adversarial scenarios are widely used to probe safety limits, but many prioritise difficulty over realism, producing exaggerated behaviours which may result in AV controllers that are overly conservative. We propose an alternative method, instead using a cognitively inspired pedestrian model featuring both inter-individual and intra-individual variability to generate behaviourally plausible adversarial scenarios. We provide a proof of concept demonstration of this method's potential for AV control optimisation, in closed-loop testing and tuning of an AV controller. Our results show that replacing the rule-based CARLA pedestrian with the human-like model yields more realistic gap acceptance patterns and smoother vehicle decelerations. Unsafe interactions occur only for certain pedestrian individuals and conditions, underscoring the importance of human variability in AV testing. Adversarial scenarios generated by this model can be used to optimise AV control towards safer and more efficient behaviour. Overall, this work illustrates how incorporating human-like road user models into simulation-based adversarial testing can enhance the credibility of AV evaluation and provide a practical basis to behaviourally informed controller optimisation.

### 4. [Differential Barometric Altimetry for Submeter Vertical Localization and Floor Recognition Indoors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02184v1)

Authors: Yuhang Zhang, Sören Schwertfeger

Accurate altitude estimation and reliable floor recognition are critical for mobile robot localization and navigation within complex multi-storey environments. In this paper, we present a robust, low-cost vertical estimation framework leveraging differential barometric sensing integrated within a fully ROS-compliant software package. Our system simultaneously publishes real-time altitude data from both a stationary base station and a mobile sensor, enabling precise and drift-free vertical localization. Empirical evaluations conducted in challenging scenarios -- such as fully enclosed stairwells and elevators, demonstrate that our proposed barometric pipeline achieves sub-meter vertical accuracy (RMSE: 0.29 m) and perfect (100%) floor-level identification. In contrast, our results confirm that standalone height estimates, obtained solely from visual- or LiDAR-based SLAM odometry, are insufficient for reliable vertical localization. The proposed ROS-compatible barometric module thus provides a practical and cost-effective solution for robust vertical awareness in real-world robotic deployments. The implementation of our method is released as open source at https://github.com/witsir/differential-barometric.

### 5. [AlignDrive: Aligned Lateral-Longitudinal Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01762v1)

Authors: Yanhao Wu, Haoyang Zhang, Fei He, Rui Wu, Congpei Qiu, Liang Gao, Wei Ke, Tong Zhang

End-to-end autonomous driving has rapidly progressed, enabling joint perception and planning in complex environments. In the planning stage, state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end autonomous driving models decouple planning into parallel lateral and longitudinal predictions. While effective, this parallel design can lead to i) coordination failures between the planned path and speed, and ii) underutilization of the drive path as a prior for longitudinal planning, thus redundantly encoding static information. To address this, we propose a novel cascaded framework that explicitly conditions longitudinal planning on the drive path, enabling coordinated and collision-aware lateral and longitudinal planning. Specifically, we introduce a path-conditioned formulation that explicitly incorporates the drive path into longitudinal planning. Building on this, the model predicts longitudinal displacements along the drive path rather than full 2D trajectory waypoints. This design simplifies longitudinal reasoning and more tightly couples it with lateral planning. Additionally, we introduce a planning-oriented data augmentation strategy that simulates rare safety-critical events, such as vehicle cut-ins, by adding agents and relabeling longitudinal targets to avoid collision. Evaluated on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, our method sets a new SOTA, achieving a driving score of 89.07 and a success rate of 73.18%, demonstrating significantly improved coordination and safety

### 6. [Deep Robust Koopman Learning from Noisy Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01971v1)

Authors: Aditya Singh, Rajpal Singh, Jishnu Keshavan

Koopman operator theory has emerged as a leading data-driven approach that relies on a judicious choice of observable functions to realize global linear representations of nonlinear systems in the lifted observable space. However, real-world data is often noisy, making it difficult to obtain an accurate and unbiased approximation of the Koopman operator. The Koopman operator generated from noisy datasets is typically corrupted by noise-induced bias that severely degrades prediction and downstream tracking performance. In order to address this drawback, this paper proposes a novel autoencoder-based neural architecture to jointly learn the appropriate lifting functions and the reduced-bias Koopman operator from noisy data. The architecture initially learns the Koopman basis functions that are consistent for both the forward and backward temporal dynamics of the system. Subsequently, by utilizing the learned forward and backward temporal dynamics, the Koopman operator is synthesized with a reduced bias making the method more robust to noise compared to existing techniques. Theoretical analysis is used to demonstrate significant bias reduction in the presence of training noise. Dynamics prediction and tracking control simulations are conducted for multiple serial manipulator arms, including performance comparisons with leading alternative designs, to demonstrate its robustness under various noise levels. Experimental studies with the Franka FR3 7-DoF manipulator arm are further used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a practical setting.

### 7. [From Metrics to Meaning: Insights from a Mixed-Methods Field Experiment on Retail Robot Deployment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01946v1)

Authors: Sichao Song, Yuki Okafuji, Takuya Iwamoto, Jun Baba, Hiroshi Ishiguro

We report a mixed-methods field experiment of a conversational service robot deployed under everyday staffing discretion in a live bedding store. Over 12 days we alternated three conditions--Baseline (no robot), Robot-only, and Robot+Fixture--and video-annotated the service funnel from passersby to purchase. An explanatory sequential design then used six post-experiment staff interviews to interpret the quantitative patterns.
  Quantitatively, the robot increased stopping per passerby (highest with the fixture), yet clerk-led downstream steps per stopper--clerk approach, store entry, assisted experience, and purchase--decreased. Interviews explained this divergence: clerks avoided interrupting ongoing robot-customer talk, struggled with ambiguous timing amid conversational latency, and noted child-centered attraction that often satisfied curiosity at the doorway. The fixture amplified visibility but also anchored encounters at the threshold, creating a well-defined micro-space where needs could ``close'' without moving inside.
  We synthesize these strands into an integrative account from the initial show of interest on the part of a customer to their entering the store and derive actionable guidance. The results advance the understanding of interactions between customers, staff members, and the robot and offer practical recommendations for deploying service robots in high-touch retail.

The development of robust and generalizable robot learning models is critically contingent upon the availability of large-scale, diverse training data and reliable evaluation benchmarks. Collecting data in the physical world poses prohibitive costs and scalability challenges, and prevailing simulation benchmarks frequently suffer from fragmentation, narrow scope, or insufficient fidelity to enable effective sim-to-real transfer. To address these challenges, we introduce Genie Sim 3.0, a unified simulation platform for robotic manipulation. We present Genie Sim Generator, a large language model (LLM)-powered tool that constructs high-fidelity scenes from natural language instructions. Its principal strength resides in rapid and multi-dimensional generalization, facilitating the synthesis of diverse environments to support scalable data collection and robust policy evaluation. We introduce the first benchmark that pioneers the application of LLM for automated evaluation. It leverages LLM to mass-generate evaluation scenarios and employs Vision-Language Model (VLM) to establish an automated assessment pipeline. We also release an open-source dataset comprising more than 10,000 hours of synthetic data across over 200 tasks. Through systematic experimentation, we validate the robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability of our open-source dataset, demonstrating that synthetic data can server as an effective substitute for real-world data under controlled conditions for scalable policy training.

Authors: Hongbo Duan, Shangyi Luo, Zhiyuan Deng, Yanbo Chen, Yuanhao Chiang, Yi Liu, Fangming Liu, Xueqian Wang

Autonomous language-guided navigation in large-scale outdoor environments remains a key challenge in mobile robotics, due to difficulties in semantic reasoning, dynamic conditions, and long-term stability. We propose CausalNav, the first scene graph-based semantic navigation framework tailored for dynamic outdoor environments. We construct a multi-level semantic scene graph using LLMs, referred to as the Embodied Graph, that hierarchically integrates coarse-grained map data with fine-grained object entities. The constructed graph serves as a retrievable knowledge base for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling semantic navigation and long-range planning under open-vocabulary queries. By fusing real-time perception with offline map data, the Embodied Graph supports robust navigation across varying spatial granularities in dynamic outdoor environments. Dynamic objects are explicitly handled in both the scene graph construction and hierarchical planning modules. The Embodied Graph is continuously updated within a temporal window to reflect environmental changes and support real-time semantic navigation. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate superior robustness and efficiency.

### 10. [Real-Time Lane Detection via Efficient Feature Alignment and Covariance Optimization for Low-Power Embedded Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01696v1)

Authors: Yian Liu, Xiong Wang, Ping Xu, Lei Zhu, Ming Yan, Linyun Xue

Real-time lane detection in embedded systems encounters significant challenges due to subtle and sparse visual signals in RGB images, often constrained by limited computational resources and power consumption. Although deep learning models for lane detection categorized into segmentation-based, anchor-based, and curve-based methods there remains a scarcity of universally applicable optimization techniques tailored for low-power embedded environments. To overcome this, we propose an innovative Covariance Distribution Optimization (CDO) module specifically designed for efficient, real-time applications. The CDO module aligns lane feature distributions closely with ground-truth labels, significantly enhancing detection accuracy without increasing computational complexity. Evaluations were conducted on six diverse models across all three method categories, including two optimized for real-time applications and four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, tested comprehensively on three major datasets: CULane, TuSimple, and LLAMAS. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements ranging from 0.01% to 1.5%. The proposed CDO module is characterized by ease of integration into existing systems without structural modifications and utilizes existing model parameters to facilitate ongoing training, thus offering substantial benefits in performance, power efficiency, and operational flexibility in embedded systems.

Authors: Alexander Korn, Lea Zaruchas, Chetan Arora, Andreas Metzger, Sven Smolka, Fanyu Wang, Andreas Vogelsang

Large Language Models, particularly decoder-only generative models such as GPT, are increasingly used to automate Software Engineering tasks. These models are primarily guided through natural language prompts, making prompt engineering a critical factor in system performance and behavior. Despite their growing role in SE research, prompt-related decisions are rarely documented in a systematic or transparent manner, hindering reproducibility and comparability across studies. To address this gap, we conducted a two-phase empirical study. First, we analyzed nearly 300 papers published at the top-3 SE conferences since 2022 to assess how prompt design, testing, and optimization are currently reported. Second, we surveyed 105 program committee members from these conferences to capture their expectations for prompt reporting in LLM-driven research. Based on the findings, we derived a structured guideline that distinguishes essential, desirable, and exceptional reporting elements. Our results reveal significant misalignment between current practices and reviewer expectations, particularly regarding version disclosure, prompt justification, and threats to validity. We present our guideline as a step toward improving transparency, reproducibility, and methodological rigor in LLM-based SE research.

Authors: Mohammad Reza Heidari Iman, Giorgio Di Natale, Katell Morin-Allory

Functional verification increasingly relies on Assertion-Based Verification (ABV), which has become a key approach for verifying hardware designs due to its efficiency and effectiveness. Central to ABV are automatic assertion miners, which apply different techniques to generate assertions automatically. This paper reviews the most recent, advanced, and widely adopted assertion miners, offering a comparative analysis of their methodologies. The goal is to provide researchers and verification practitioners with insights into the capabilities and limitations of existing miners. By identifying their shortcomings, this work also points toward directions for developing more powerful and advanced assertion miners in the future.

### 3. [LIA: Supervised Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models for Automatic Issue Assignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01780v1)

Authors: Arsham Khosravani, Alireza Hosseinpour, Arshia Akhavan, Mehdi Keshani, Abbas Heydarnoori

Issue assignment is a critical process in software maintenance, where new issue reports are validated and assigned to suitable developers. However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly. Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment. By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score. These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-adapted LLMs for software maintenance tasks and establish LIA as a practical, high-performing solution for issue assignment.

### 4. [The State of Open Science in Software Engineering Research: A Case Study of ICSE Artifacts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02066v1)

Authors: Al Muttakin, Saikat Mondal, Chanchal Roy

Replication packages are crucial for enabling transparency, validation, and reuse in software engineering (SE) research. While artifact sharing is now a standard practice and even expected at premier SE venues such as ICSE, the practical usability of these replication packages remains underexplored. In particular, there is a marked lack of studies that comprehensively examine the executability and reproducibility of replication packages in SE research. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by evaluating 100 replication packages published as part of ICSE proceedings over the past decade (2015--2024). We assess the (1) executability of the replication packages, (2) efforts and modifications required to execute them, (3) challenges that prevent executability, and (4) reproducibility of the original findings. We spent approximately 650 person-hours in total executing the artifacts and reproducing the study findings. Our findings reveal that only 40\% of the 100 evaluated artifacts were executable, of which 32.5\% (13 out of 40) ran without any modification. Regarding effort levels, 17.5\% (7 out of 40) required low effort, while 82.5\% (33 out of 40) required moderate to high effort to execute successfully. We identified five common types of modifications and 13 challenges leading to execution failure, spanning environmental, documentation, and structural issues. Among the executable artifacts, only 35\% (14 out of 40) reproduced the original results. These findings highlight a notable gap between artifact availability, executability, and reproducibility. Our study proposes three actionable guidelines to improve the preparation, documentation, and review of research artifacts, thereby strengthening the rigor and sustainability of open science practices in SE research.

### 5. [Perish or Flourish? A Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Generation in Functional Programming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02060v1)

Authors: Nguyet-Anh H. Lang, Eric Lang, Thanh Le-Cong, Bach Le, Quyet-Thang Huynh

Functional programming provides strong foundations for developing reliable and secure software systems, yet its adoption remains not widespread due to the steep learning curve. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation present new opportunities to lower these barriers. However, extensive evaluations of LLMs largely focus on imperative programming languages, and their capabilities in functional programming languages (FP) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce FPEval, a holistic evaluation framework built on FPBench, a new benchmark of 721 programming tasks across three difficulty levels on three mainstream FP languages: Haskell, Ocaml and Scala. FPEval provides compehensive evaluation infrastructures with both test validations with comprehensive test suites and static analysis tools to assess both functional correctness and code style and maintainability. Using this framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, for code generation in functional programming languages and Java as an imperative baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLM performance in functional programming improves substantially with model advancement; however, error rates remain significantly higher in purely functional languages (Haskell and OCaml) than in hybrid (Scala) or imperative (Java) languages. Moreover, LLMs frequently generate non-idiomatic functional code that follows imperative patterns, raising concerns about code style and long-term maintainability. Finally, we show that LLMs can partially self-repair both correctness and quality issues when provided with static analysis feedback and hand-crafted instructions for common types of issues.

Authors: Patrick Hopf, Erick Ochoa Lopez, Yannick Stade, Damian Rovara, Nils Quetschlich, Ioan Albert Florea, Josh Izaac, Robert Wille, Lukas Burgholzer

Compilers transform code into action. They convert high-level programs into executable hardware instructions - a crucial step in enabling reliable and scalable quantum computation. However, quantum compilation is still in its infancy, and many existing solutions are ad hoc, often developed independently and from scratch. The resulting lack of interoperability leads to significant missed potential, as quantum software tools remain isolated and cannot be seamlessly integrated into cohesive toolchains.
  The Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) has addressed analogous challenges in the classical domain. It was developed within the LLVM project, which has long powered robust software stacks and enabled compilation across diverse software and hardware components, with particular importance in high-performance computing environments. However, MLIR's steep learning curve poses a significant barrier to entry, particularly in quantum computing, where much of the software stack is still predominantly built by experimentalists out of necessity rather than by experienced software engineers.
  This paper provides a practical and hands-on guide for quantum software engineers to overcome this steep learning curve. Through a concrete case study linking Xanadu's PennyLane framework with the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), we outline actionable integration steps, highlight best practices, and share hard-earned insights from real-world development. This work aims to support quantum tool developers in navigating MLIR's complexities and to foster its adoption as a unifying bridge across a rapidly growing ecosystem of quantum software tools, ultimately guiding the development of more modular, interoperable, and integrated quantum software stacks.

Authors: Shuoming Zhang, Jiacheng Zhao, Qiuchu Yu, Chunwei Xia, Zheng Wang, Xiaobing Feng, Huimin Cui

This survey has provided a systematic overview of the emerging field of LLM-enabled compilation by addressing several key research questions. We first answered how LLMs are being integrated by proposing a comprehensive, multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes works based on their Design Philosophy (Selector, Translator, Generator), LLM Methodology, their operational Level of Code Abstraction, and the specific Task Type they address. In answering what advancements these approaches offer, we identified three primary benefits: the democratization of compiler development, the discovery of novel optimization strategies, and the broadening of the compiler's traditional scope. Finally, in addressing the field's challenges and opportunities, we highlighted the critical hurdles of ensuring correctness and achieving scalability, while identifying the development of hybrid systems as the most promising path forward. By providing these answers, this survey serves as a foundational roadmap for researchers and practitioners, charting the course for a new generation of LLM-powered, intelligent, adaptive and synergistic compilation tools.

Authors: Matteo Esposito, Andrea Janes, Valentina Lenarduzzi, Davide Taibi

In the early 1980s, Open Source Software emerged as a revolutionary concept amidst the dominance of proprietary software. What began as a revolutionary idea has now become the cornerstone of computer science. Amidst OSS projects, AI is increasing its presence and relevance. However, despite the growing popularity of AI, its adoption and impacts on OSS projects remain underexplored.
  We aim to assess the adoption of AI libraries in Python and Java OSS projects and examine how they shape development, including the technical ecosystem and community engagement. To this end, we will perform a large-scale analysis on 157.7k potential OSS repositories, employing repository metrics and software metrics to compare projects adopting AI libraries against those that do not. We expect to identify measurable differences in development activity, community engagement, and code complexity between OSS projects that adopt AI libraries and those that do not, offering evidence-based insights into how AI integration reshapes software development practices.

Authors: Mikel Robredo, Matteo Esposito, Fabio Palomba, Rafael Peñaloza, Valentina Lenarduzzi

Background. Defect prediction has been a highly active topic among researchers in the Empirical Software Engineering field. Previous literature has successfully achieved the most accurate prediction of an incoming fault and identified the features and anomalies that precede it through just-in-time prediction. As software systems evolve continuously, there is a growing need for time-sensitive methods capable of forecasting defects before they manifest.
  Aim. Our study seeks to explore the effectiveness of time-sensitive techniques for defect forecasting. Moreover, we aim to investigate the early indicators that precede the occurrence of a defect.

Authors: Nenad Petrovic, Vahid Zolfaghari, Fengjunjie Pan, Alois Knoll

This paper presents LLM-empowered workflow to support Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) software development, covering the aspects of security-aware system topology design, as well as event-driven decision-making code analysis. For code analysis we adopt event chains model which provides formal foundations to systematic validation of functional safety, taking into account the semantic validity of messages exchanged between key components, including both CAN and Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS). Analysis of security aspects for topology relies on synergy with Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach and Object Constraint Language (OCL) rules. Both locally deployable and proprietary solution are taken into account for evaluation within Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)-related scenarios.

### 1. [Inferring Network Evolutionary History via Structure-State Coupled Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02121v1)

Authors: En Xu, Shihe Zhou, Huandong Wang, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li

Inferring a network's evolutionary history from a single final snapshot with limited temporal annotations is fundamental yet challenging. Existing approaches predominantly rely on topology alone, which often provides insufficient and noisy cues. This paper leverages network steady-state dynamics -- converged node states under a given dynamical process -- as an additional and widely accessible observation for network evolution history inference. We propose CS$^2$, which explicitly models structure-state coupling to capture how topology modulates steady states and how the two signals jointly improve edge discrimination for formation-order recovery. Experiments on six real temporal networks, evaluated under multiple dynamical processes, show that CS$^2$ consistently outperforms strong baselines, improving pairwise edge precedence accuracy by 4.0% on average and global ordering consistency (Spearman-$ρ$) by 7.7% on average. CS$^2$ also more faithfully recovers macroscopic evolution trajectories such as clustering formation, degree heterogeneity, and hub growth. Moreover, a steady-state-only variant remains competitive when reliable topology is limited, highlighting steady states as an independent signal for evolution inference.

### 2. [Fixed-Size Dynamic Scale-Free Networks: Modeling, Stationarity, and Resilience](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01882v1)

Authors: Yichao Yao, Minyu Feng, Matjaž Perc, Jürgen Kurths

Many real-world scale-free networks, such as neural networks and online communication networks, consist of a fixed number of nodes but exhibit dynamic edge fluctuations. However, traditional models frequently overlook scenarios where the node count remains constant, instead prioritizing node growth. In this work, we depart from the assumptions of node number variation and preferential attachment to present an innovative model that conceptualizes node degree fluctuations as a state-dependent random walk process with stasis and variable diffusion coefficient. We show that this model yields stochastic dynamic networks with stable scale-free properties. Through comprehensive theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the degree distribution converges to a power-law distribution, provided that the lowest degree state within the network is not an absorbing state. Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of the fraction of the largest component and the average shortest path length following deliberate attacks on the network. By using three real-world networks, we confirm that the proposed model accurately replicates actual data. The proposed model thus elucidates mechanisms by which networks, devoid of growth and preferential attachment features, can still exhibit power-law distributions and be used to simulate and study the resilience of attacked fixed-size scale-free networks.

### 3. [Beyond Homophily: Community Search on Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01703v1)

Authors: Qing Sima, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenjie Zhang

Community search aims to identify a refined set of nodes that are most relevant to a given query, supporting tasks ranging from fraud detection to recommendation. Unlike homophilic graphs, many real-world networks are heterophilic, where edges predominantly connect dissimilar nodes. Therefore, structural signals that once reflected smooth, low-frequency similarity now appear as sharp, high-frequency contrasts. However, both classical algorithms (e.g., k-core, k-truss) and recent ML-based models struggle to achieve effective community search on heterophilic graphs, where edge signs or semantics are generally unknown. Algorithm-based methods often return communities with mixed class labels, while GNNs, built on homophily, smooth away meaningful signals and blur community boundaries. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Community Search (AdaptCS), a unified framework featuring three key designs: (i) an AdaptCS Encoder that disentangles multi-hop and multi-frequency signals, enabling the model to capture both smooth (homophilic) and contrastive (heterophilic) relations; (ii) a memory-efficient low-rank optimization that removes the main computational bottleneck and ensures model scalability; and (iii) an Adaptive Community Score (ACS) that guides online search by balancing embedding similarity and topological relations. Extensive experiments on both heterophilic and homophilic benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptCS outperforms the best-performing baseline by an average of 11% in F1-score, retains robustness across heterophily levels, and achieves up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup.

### 4. [A series of real networks invariants](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02052v1)

Authors: Mikhail Tuzhilin

In this article we propose a generalization of two known invariants of real networks: degree and ksi-centrality. More precisely, we found a series of centralities based on Laplacian matrix, that have exponential distributions (power-law for the case $j = 0$) for real networks and different distributions for artificial ones.

### 1. [Learning with Monotone Adversarial Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02193v1)

Authors: Kasper Green Larsen, Chirag Pabbaraju, Abhishek Shetty

We study the extent to which standard machine learning algorithms rely on exchangeability and independence of data by introducing a monotone adversarial corruption model. In this model, an adversary, upon looking at a "clean" i.i.d. dataset, inserts additional "corrupted" points of their choice into the dataset. These added points are constrained to be monotone corruptions, in that they get labeled according to the ground-truth target function. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that in this setting, all known optimal learning algorithms for binary classification can be made to achieve suboptimal expected error on a new independent test point drawn from the same distribution as the clean dataset. On the other hand, we show that uniform convergence-based algorithms do not degrade in their guarantees. Our results showcase how optimal learning algorithms break down in the face of seemingly helpful monotone corruptions, exposing their overreliance on exchangeability.

### 2. [Multi-fidelity graph-based neural networks architectures to learn Navier-Stokes solutions on non-parametrized 2D domains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02157v1)

Authors: Francesco Songia, Raoul Sallé de Chou, Hugues Talbot, Irene Vignon-Clementel

We propose a graph-based, multi-fidelity learning framework for the prediction of stationary Navier--Stokes solutions in non-parametrized two-dimensional geometries. The method is designed to guide the learning process through successive approximations, starting from reduced-order and full Stokes models, and progressively approaching the Navier--Stokes solution. To effectively capture both local and long-range dependencies in the velocity and pressure fields, we combine graph neural networks with Transformer and Mamba architectures. While Transformers achieve the highest accuracy, we show that Mamba can be successfully adapted to graph-structured data through an unsupervised node-ordering strategy. The Mamba approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Physical knowledge is embedded directly into the architecture through an encoding -- processing -- physics informed decoding pipeline. Derivatives are computed through algebraic operators constructed via the Weighted Least Squares method. The flexibility of these operators allows us not only to make the output obey the governing equations, but also to constrain selected hidden features to satisfy mass conservation. We introduce additional physical biases through an enriched graph convolution with the same differential operators describing the PDEs. Overall, we successfully guide the learning process by physical knowledge and fluid dynamics insights, leading to more regular and accurate predictions

### 3. [Sparse Convex Biclustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01757v1)

Authors: Jiakun Jiang, Dewei Xiang, Chenliang Gu, Wei Liu, Binhuan Wang

Biclustering is an essential unsupervised machine learning technique for simultaneously clustering rows and columns of a data matrix, with widespread applications in genomics, transcriptomics, and other high-dimensional omics data. Despite its importance, existing biclustering methods struggle to meet the demands of modern large-scale datasets. The challenges stem from the accumulation of noise in high-dimensional features, the limitations of non-convex optimization formulations, and the computational complexity of identifying meaningful biclusters. These issues often result in reduced accuracy and stability as the size of the dataset increases. To overcome these challenges, we propose Sparse Convex Biclustering (SpaCoBi), a novel method that penalizes noise during the biclustering process to improve both accuracy and robustness. By adopting a convex optimization framework and introducing a stability-based tuning criterion, SpaCoBi achieves an optimal balance between cluster fidelity and sparsity. Comprehensive numerical studies, including simulations and an application to mouse olfactory bulb data, demonstrate that SpaCoBi significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy. These results highlight SpaCoBi as a robust and efficient solution for biclustering in high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

### 4. [Varying-Coefficient Mixture of Experts Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01699v1)

Authors: Qicheng Zhao, Celia M. T. Greenwood, Qihuang Zhang

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a flexible framework that combines multiple specialized submodels (``experts''), by assigning covariate-dependent weights (``gating functions'') to each expert, and have been commonly used for analyzing heterogeneous data. Existing statistical MoE formulations typically assume constant coefficients, for covariate effects within the expert or gating models, which can be inadequate for longitudinal, spatial, or other dynamic settings where covariate influences and latent subpopulation structure evolve across a known dimension. We propose a Varying-Coefficient Mixture of Experts (VCMoE) model that allows all coefficient effects in both the gating functions and expert models to vary along an indexing variable. We establish identifiability and consistency of the proposed model, and develop an estimation procedure, label-consistent EM algorithm, for both fully functional and hybrid specifications, along with the corresponding asymptotic distributions of the resulting estimators. For inference, simultaneous confidence bands are constructed using both asymptotic theory for the maximum discrepancy between the estimated functional coefficients and their true counterparts, and with bootstrap methods. In addition, a generalized likelihood ratio test is developed to examine whether a coefficient function is genuinely varying across the index variable. Simulation studies demonstrate good finite-sample performance, with acceptable bias and satisfactory coverage rates. We illustrate the proposed VCMoE model using a dataset of single nucleus gene expression in embryonic mice to characterize the temporal dynamics of the associations between the expression levels of genes Satb2 and Bcl11b across two latent cell subpopulations of neurons, yielding results that are consistent with prior findings.

### 5. [From Mice to Trains: Amortized Bayesian Inference on Graph Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02241v1)

Authors: Svenja Jedhoff, Elizaveta Semenova, Aura Raulo, Anne Meyer, Paul-Christian Bürkner

Graphs arise across diverse domains, from biology and chemistry to social and information networks, as well as in transportation and logistics. Inference on graph-structured data requires methods that are permutation-invariant, scalable across varying sizes and sparsities, and capable of capturing complex long-range dependencies, making posterior estimation on graph parameters particularly challenging. Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) is a simulation-based framework that employs generative neural networks to enable fast, likelihood-free posterior inference. We adapt ABI to graph data to address these challenges to perform inference on node-, edge-, and graph-level parameters. Our approach couples permutation-invariant graph encoders with flexible neural posterior estimators in a two-module pipeline: a summary network maps attributed graphs to fixed-length representations, and an inference network approximates the posterior over parameters. In this setting, several neural architectures can serve as the summary network. In this work we evaluate multiple architectures and assess their performance on controlled synthetic settings and two real-world domains - biology and logistics - in terms of recovery and calibration.

### 6. [Spatio-temporal modeling and forecasting with Fourier neural operators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01813v1)

Authors: Pratik Nag, Andrew Zammit-Mangion, Sumeetpal Singh, Noel Cressie

Spatio-temporal process models are often used for modeling dynamic physical and biological phenomena that evolve across space and time. These phenomena may exhibit environmental heterogeneity and complex interactions that are difficult to capture using traditional statistical process models such as Gaussian processes. This work proposes the use of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for constructing statistical dynamical spatio-temporal models for forecasting. An FNO is a flexible mapping of functions that approximates the solution operator of possibly unknown linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a computationally efficient manner. It does so using samples of inputs and their respective outputs, and hence explicit knowledge of the underlying PDE is not required. Through simulations from a nonlinear PDE with known solution, we compare FNO forecasts to those from state-of-the-art statistical spatio-temporal-forecasting methods. Further, using sea surface temperature data over the Atlantic Ocean and precipitation data across Europe, we demonstrate the ability of FNO-based dynamic spatio-temporal (DST) statistical modeling to capture complex real-world spatio-temporal dependencies. Using collections of testing instances, we show that the FNO-DST forecasts are accurate with valid uncertainty quantification.

### 7. [A Multilayered Approach to Classifying Customer Responsiveness and Credit Risk](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.01970v1)

Authors: Ayomide Afolabi, Ebere Ogburu, Symon Kimitei

This study evaluates the performance of various classifiers in three distinct models: response, risk, and response-risk, concerning credit card mail campaigns and default prediction. In the response model, the Extra Trees classifier demonstrates the highest recall level (79.1%), emphasizing its effectiveness in identifying potential responders to targeted credit card offers. Conversely, in the risk model, the Random Forest classifier exhibits remarkable specificity of 84.1%, crucial for identifying customers least likely to default. Furthermore, in the multi-class response-risk model, the Random Forest classifier achieves the highest accuracy (83.2%), indicating its efficacy in discerning both potential responders to credit card mail campaign and low-risk credit card users. In this study, we optimized various performance metrics to solve a specific credit risk and mail responsiveness business problem.

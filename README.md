### Artificial Intelligence

### 1. [The Necessity of a Unified Framework for LLM-Based Agent Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03238v1)

Authors: Pengyu Zhu, Li Sun, Philip S. Yu, Sen Su

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results. This lack of standardization introduces substantial unfairness and opacity into the field. We propose that a unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation. To this end, we introduce a proposal aimed at standardizing agent evaluation.

### 2. [Distribution-Aware End-to-End Embedding for Streaming Numerical Features in Click-Through Rate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03223v1)

Authors: Jiahao Liu, Hongji Ruan, Weimin Zhang, Ziye Tong, Derick Tang, Zhanpeng Zeng, Qinsong Zeng, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu

This paper explores effective numerical feature embedding for Click-Through Rate prediction in streaming environments. Conventional static binning methods rely on offline statistics of numerical distributions; however, this inherently two-stage process often triggers semantic drift during bin boundary updates. While neural embedding methods enable end-to-end learning, they often discard explicit distributional information. Integrating such information end-to-end is challenging because streaming features often violate the i.i.d. assumption, precluding unbiased estimation of the population distribution via the expectation of order statistics. Furthermore, the critical context dependency of numerical distributions is often neglected. To this end, we propose DAES, an end-to-end framework designed to tackle numerical feature embedding in streaming training scenarios by integrating distributional information with an adaptive modulation mechanism. Specifically, we introduce an efficient reservoir-sampling-based distribution estimation method and two field-aware distribution modulation strategies to capture streaming distributions and field-dependent semantics. DAES significantly outperforms existing approaches as demonstrated by extensive offline and online experiments and has been fully deployed on a leading short-video platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users.

### 3. [VALUEFLOW: Toward Pluralistic and Steerable Value-based Alignment in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03160v1)

Authors: Woojin Kim, Sieun Hyeon, Jusang Oh, Jaeyoung Do

Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with the diverse spectrum of human values remains a central challenge: preference-based methods often fail to capture deeper motivational principles. Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. This paper establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity, advancing pluralistic alignment of LLMs.

### 4. [Beyond Cropping and Rotation: Automated Evolution of Powerful Task-Specific Augmentations with Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03123v1)

Authors: Judah Goldfeder, Shreyes Kaliyur, Vaibhav Sourirajan, Patrick Minwan Puma, Philippe Martin Wyder, Yuhang Hu, Jiong Lin, Hod Lipson

Data augmentation has long been a cornerstone for reducing overfitting in vision models, with methods like AutoAugment automating the design of task-specific augmentations. Recent advances in generative models, such as conditional diffusion and few-shot NeRFs, offer a new paradigm for data augmentation by synthesizing data with significantly greater diversity and realism. However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations. Our pipeline introduces a novel approach to image augmentation that learns stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling more structured and adaptive transformations. We demonstrate strong performance across fine-grained classification and few-shot learning tasks. Notably, our pipeline discovers augmentations that align with domain knowledge, even in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential of learned generative augmentations, unlocking new possibilities for robust model training.

### 5. [Visual Reasoning over Time Series via Multi-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03026v1)

Authors: Weilin Ruan, Yuxuan Liang

Time series analysis underpins many real-world applications, yet existing time-series-specific methods and pretrained large-model-based approaches remain limited in integrating intuitive visual reasoning and generalizing across tasks with adaptive tool usage. To address these limitations, we propose MAS4TS, a tool-driven multi-agent system for general time series tasks, built upon an Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm that integrates agent communication, visual reasoning, and latent reconstruction within a unified framework. MAS4TS first performs visual reasoning over time series plots with structured priors using a Vision-Language Model to extract temporal structures, and subsequently reconstructs predictive trajectories in latent space. Three specialized agents coordinate via shared memory and gated communication, while a router selects task-specific tool chains for execution. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MAS4TS achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of time series tasks, while exhibiting strong generalization and efficient inference.

### 6. [Consistency Deep Equilibrium Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03024v1)

Authors: Junchao Lin, Zenan Ling, Jingwen Xu, Robert C. Qiu

Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning, offering the ability to model infinite-depth networks with constant memory usage. However, DEQs incur significant inference latency due to the iterative nature of fixed-point solvers. In this work, we introduce the Consistency Deep Equilibrium Model (C-DEQ), a novel framework that leverages consistency distillation to accelerate DEQ inference. We cast the DEQ iterative inference process as evolution along a fixed ODE trajectory toward the equilibrium. Along this trajectory, we train C-DEQs to consistently map intermediate states directly to the fixed point, enabling few-step inference while preserving the performance of the teacher DEQ. At the same time, it facilitates multi-step evaluation to flexibly trade computation for performance gains. Extensive experiments across various domain tasks demonstrate that C-DEQs achieves consistent 2-20$\times$ accuracy improvements over implicit DEQs under the same few-step inference budget.

### 7. [Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder for Reliable and Interpretable Process Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03004v1)

Authors: Xiangrui Zhang, Chunyue Song, Wei Dai, Zheng Zhang, Kaihua Gao, Furong Gao

To improve the reliability and interpretability of industrial process monitoring, this article proposes a Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder (CGSTAE). The network architecture of CGSTAE combines two components: a correlation graph structure learning module based on spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder module utilizing graph convolutional long-short term memory (GCLSTM). The SSAM learns correlation graphs by capturing dynamic relationships between variables, while a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is introduced to derive a causal graph from these correlation graphs. The algorithm leverages a reverse perspective of causal invariance principle to uncover the invariant causal graph from varying correlations. The spatial-temporal encoder-decoder, built with GCLSTM units, reconstructs time-series process data within a sequence-to-sequence framework. The proposed CGSTAE enables effective process monitoring and fault detection through two statistics in the feature space and residual space. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of CGSTAE in process monitoring through the Tennessee Eastman process and a real-world air separation process.

### 8. [NLI:Non-uniform Linear Interpolation Approximation of Nonlinear Operations for Efficient LLMs Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02988v1)

Authors: Jiangyong Yu, Xiaomeng Han, Xing Hu, Chen Xu, Zhe Jiang, Dawei Yang

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, but their deployment is often constrained by substantial memory footprints and computational costs. While prior work has achieved significant progress in compressing and accelerating linear layers, nonlinear layers-such as SiLU, RMSNorm, and Softmax-still heavily depend on high-precision floating-point operations. In this paper, we propose a calibration-free, dynamic-programming-optimal, and hardware-friendly framework called Non-uniform Linear Interpolation (NLI). NLI is capable of efficiently approximating a variety of nonlinear functions, enabling seamless integration into LLMs and other deep neural networks with almost no loss in accuracy. NLI ingeniously recasts cutpoint selection as a dynamic-programming problem, achieving the globally minimal interpolation error in O(MxN2) time via Bellman's optimality principle. Based on the NLI algorithm, we also design and implement a plug-and-play universal nonlinear computation unit. Hardware experiments demonstrate that the NLI Engine achieves more than 4x improvement in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art designs.

### 9. [Where Norms and References Collide: Evaluating LLMs on Normative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02975v1)

Authors: Mitchell Abrams, Kaveh Eskandari Miandoab, Felix Gervits, Vasanth Sarathy, Matthias Scheutz

Embodied agents, such as robots, will need to interact in situated environments where successful communication often depends on reasoning over social norms: shared expectations that constrain what actions are appropriate in context. A key capability in such settings is norm-based reference resolution (NBRR), where interpreting referential expressions requires inferring implicit normative expectations grounded in physical and social context. Yet it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support this kind of reasoning. In this work, we introduce SNIC (Situated Norms in Context), a human-validated diagnostic testbed designed to probe how well state-of-the-art LLMs can extract and utilize normative principles relevant to NBRR. SNIC emphasizes physically grounded norms that arise in everyday tasks such as cleaning, tidying, and serving. Across a range of controlled evaluations, we find that even the strongest LLMs struggle to consistently identify and apply social norms, particularly when norms are implicit, underspecified, or in conflict. These findings reveal a blind spot in current LLMs and highlight a key challenge for deploying language-based systems in socially situated, embodied settings.

### 10. [Nüwa: Mending the Spatial Integrity Torn by VLM Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02951v1)

Authors: Yihong Huang, Fei Ma, Yihua Shao, Jingcai Guo, Zitong Yu, Laizhong Cui, Qi Tian

Vision token pruning has proven to be an effective acceleration technique for the efficient Vision Language Model (VLM). However, existing pruning methods demonstrate excellent performance preservation in visual question answering (VQA) and suffer substantial degradation on visual grounding (VG) tasks. Our analysis of the VLM's processing pipeline reveals that strategies utilizing global semantic similarity and attention scores lose the global spatial reference frame, which is derived from the interactions of tokens' positional information. Motivated by these findings, we propose $\text{Nüwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors. In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\text{Nüwa}$ achieves SOTA performance on multiple VQA benchmarks (from 94% to 95%) and yields substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (from 7% to 47%).

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [Game-Theoretic and Algorithmic Analyses of Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Costs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03455v1)

Authors: Tesshu Hanaka, Nikolaos Melissinos, Hirotaka Ono

Coordinating the movement of multiple autonomous agents over a shared network is a fundamental challenge in algorithmic robotics, intelligent transportation, and distributed systems. The dominant approach, Multi-Agent Path Finding, relies on centralized control and synchronous collision avoidance, which often requires strict synchronization and guarantees of globally conflict-free execution. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Cost model on mixed graphs, a novel framework tailored to asynchronous settings. In our model, instead of treating conflicts as hard constraints, each agent is assigned a path, and the system is evaluated through a cost function that measures potential head-on encounters. This ``crossing cost'', which is defined as the product of the numbers of agents traversing an edge in opposite directions, quantifies the risk of congestion and delay in decentralized execution.
  Our contributions are both game-theoretic and algorithmic. We model the setting as a congestion game with a non-standard cost function, prove the existence of pure Nash equilibria, and analyze the dynamics leading to them. Equilibria can be found in polynomial time under mild conditions, while the general case is PLS-complete. From an optimization perspective, minimizing the total crossing cost is NP-hard, as the problem generalizes Steiner Orientation. To address this hardness barrier, we design a suite of parameterized algorithms for minimizing crossing cost, with parameters including the number of arcs, edges, agents, and structural graph measures. These yield XP or FPT results depending on the parameter, offering algorithmic strategies for structurally restricted instances. Our framework provides a new theoretical foundation for decentralized multi-agent routing, bridging equilibrium analysis and parameterized complexity to support scalable and risk-aware coordination.

### 2. [An Algorithm for Monitoring Edge-geodetic Sets in Chordal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03288v1)

Authors: Nacim Oijid, Clara Marcille

A monitoring edge-geodetic set (or meg-set for short) of a graph is a set of vertices $M$ such that if any edge is removed, then the distance between some two vertices of $M$ increases. This notion was introduced by Foucaud et al. in 2023 as a way to monitor networks for communication failures. As computing a minimal meg-set is hard in general, recent works aimed to find polynomial-time algorithms to compute minimal meg-sets when the input belongs to a restricted class of graphs. Most of these results are based on the property of some classes of graphs to admit a unique minimum meg-set, which is then easy to compute. In this work, we prove that chordal graphs also admit a unique minimal meg-set, answering a standing open question of Foucaud et al.

### Computational Engineering

### 1. [FinMTM: A Multi-Turn Multimodal Benchmark for Financial Reasoning and Agent Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03130v1)

Authors: Chenxi Zhang, Ziliang Gan, Liyun Zhu, Youwei Pang, Qing Zhang, Rongjunchen Zhang

The financial domain poses substantial challenges for vision-language models (VLMs) due to specialized chart formats and knowledge-intensive reasoning requirements. However, existing financial benchmarks are largely single-turn and rely on a narrow set of question formats, limiting comprehensive evaluation in realistic application scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FinMTM, a multi-turn multimodal benchmark that expands diversity along both data and task dimensions. On the data side, we curate and annotate 11{,}133 bilingual (Chinese and English) financial QA pairs grounded in financial visuals, including candlestick charts, statistical plots, and report figures. On the task side, FinMTM covers single- and multiple-choice questions, multi-turn open-ended dialogues, and agent-based tasks. We further design task-specific evaluation protocols, including a set-overlap scoring rule for multiple-choice questions, a weighted combination of turn-level and session-level scores for multi-turn dialogues, and a composite metric that integrates planning quality with final outcomes for agent tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation of 22 VLMs reveal their limitations in fine-grained visual perception, long-context reasoning, and complex agent workflows.

### 2. [When Single Answer Is Not Enough: Rethinking Single-Step Retrosynthesis Benchmarks for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03554v1)

Authors: Bogdan Zagribelnyy, Ivan Ilin, Maksim Kuznetsov, Nikita Bondarev, Roman Schutski, Thomas MacDougall, Rim Shayakhmetov, Zulfat Miftakhutdinov, Mikolaj Mizera, Vladimir Aladinskiy, Alex Aliper, Alex Zhavoronkov

Recent progress has expanded the use of large language models (LLMs) in drug discovery, including synthesis planning. However, objective evaluation of retrosynthesis performance remains limited. Existing benchmarks and metrics typically rely on published synthetic procedures and Top-K accuracy based on single ground-truth, which does not capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning. We propose a new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis that evaluates both general-purpose and chemistry-specialized LLMs using ChemCensor, a novel metric for chemical plausibility. By emphasizing plausibility over exact match, this approach better aligns with human synthesis planning practices. We also introduce CREED, a novel dataset comprising millions of ChemCensor-validated reaction records for LLM training, and use it to train a model that improves over the LLM baselines under this benchmark.

### 3. [Generative Artificial Intelligence creates delicious, sustainable, and nutritious burgers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03092v1)

Authors: Vahidullah Tac, Christopher Gardner, Ellen Kuhl

Food choices shape both human and planetary health; yet, designing foods that are delicious, nutritious, and sustainable remains challenging. Here we show that generative artificial intelligence can learn the structure of the human palate directly from large-scale, human-generated recipe data to create novel foods within a structured design space. Using burgers as a model system, the generative AI rediscovers the classic Big Mac without explicit supervision and generates novel burgers optimized for deliciousness, sustainability, or nutrition. Compared to the Big Mac, its delicious burgers score the same or better in overall liking, flavor, and texture in a blinded sensory evaluation conducted in a restaurant setting with 101 participants; its mushroom burger achieves an environmental impact score more than an order of magnitude lower; and its bean burger attains nearly twice the nutritional score. Together, these results establish generative AI as a quantitative framework for learning human taste and navigating complex trade-offs in principled food design.

### 1. [Point Vortex Dynamics on Closed Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03684v1)

Authors: Marcel Padilla

The theory of point vortex dynamics has existed since Kirchhoff's proposal in 1891 and is still under development with connections to many fields in mathematics. As a strong simplification of the concept of vorticity it excels in computational speed for vorticity based fluid simulations at the cost of accuracy. Recent finding by Stefanella Boatto and Jair Koiller allowed the extension of this theory on to closed surfaces. A comprehensive guide to point vortex dynamics on closed surfaces with genus zero and vanishing total vorticity is presented here. Additionally fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics and surfaces are explained in a way to unify the theory of point vortex dynamics of the plane, the sphere and closed surfaces together with implementation details and supplement material.

Across a range of controlled evaluations, we find that even the strongest LLMs struggle to consistently identify and apply social norms, particularly when norms are implicit, underspecified, or in conflict. These findings reveal a blind spot in current LLMs and highlight a key challenge for deploying language-based systems in socially situated, embodied settings.

Vision token pruning has proven to be an effective acceleration technique for the efficient Vision Language Model (VLM). However, existing pruning methods demonstrate excellent performance preservation in visual question answering (VQA) and suffer substantial degradation on visual grounding (VG) tasks.

In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\text{Nüwa}$ achieves SOTA performance on multiple VQA benchmarks (from 94% to 95%) and yields substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (from 7% to 47%).

### 3. [Equal Access, Unequal Interaction: A Counterfactual Audit of LLM Fairness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02932v1)

Authors: Alireza Amiri-Margavi, Arshia Gharagozlou, Amin Gholami Davodi, Seyed Pouyan Mousavi Davoudi, Hamidreza Hasani Balyani

Prior work on fairness in large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on access-level behaviors such as refusals and safety filtering. However, equitable access does not ensure equitable interaction quality once a response is provided. In this paper, we conduct a controlled fairness audit examining how LLMs differ in tone, uncertainty, and linguistic framing across demographic identities after access is granted. Using a counterfactual prompt design, we evaluate GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-70B on career advice tasks while varying identity attributes along age, gender, and nationality. We assess access fairness through refusal analysis and measure interaction quality using automated linguistic metrics, including sentiment, politeness, and hedging. Identity-conditioned differences are evaluated using paired statistical tests. Both models exhibit zero refusal rates across all identities, indicating uniform access. Nevertheless, we observe systematic, model-specific disparities in interaction quality: GPT-4 expresses significantly higher hedging toward younger male users, while LLaMA exhibits broader sentiment variation across identity groups. These results show that fairness disparities can persist at the interaction level even when access is equal, motivating evaluation beyond refusal-based audits.

### 4. [Efficient Algorithms for Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problems over Control-flow Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03588v1)

Authors: Xuran Cai, Amir Goharshady

In this work, we focus on the Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) over control-flow graphs (CFGs) of programs. PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \(O(|G| \cdot |D|^6)\), where \(|G|\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE. In addition, we provide experimental results over another classical PCSP task, i.e. Optimal Bank Selection, achieving runtimes four times better than the previous state of the art.

### 5. [Learning to Reason Faithfully through Step-Level Faithfulness Maximization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03507v1)

Authors: Runquan Gui, Yafu Li, Xiaoye Qu, Ziyan Liu, Yeqiu Cheng, Yu Cheng

Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has markedly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, most RLVR pipelines rely on sparse outcome-based rewards, providing little supervision over intermediate steps and thus encouraging over-confidence and spurious reasoning, which in turn increases hallucinations. To address this, we propose FaithRL, a general reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes reasoning faithfulness. We formalize a faithfulness-maximization objective and theoretically show that optimizing it mitigates over-confidence. To instantiate this objective, we introduce a geometric reward design and a faithfulness-aware advantage modulation mechanism that assigns step-level credit by penalizing unsupported steps while preserving valid partial derivations. Across diverse backbones and benchmarks, FaithRL consistently reduces hallucination rates while maintaining (and often improving) answer correctness. Further analysis confirms that FaithRL increases step-wise reasoning faithfulness and generalizes robustly. Our code is available at https://github.com/aintdoin/FaithRL.

### 6. [DiscoverLLM: From Executing Intents to Discovering Them](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03429v1)

Authors: Tae Soo Kim, Yoonjoo Lee, Jaesang Yu, John Joon Young Chung, Juho Kim

To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking "what kind of tone do you want?" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.

### 7. [Towards Distillation-Resistant Large Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03396v1)

Authors: Hao Fang, Tianyi Zhang, Tianqu Zhuang, Jiawei Kong, Kuofeng Gao, Bin Chen, Leqi Liang, Shu-Tao Xia, Ke Xu

Proprietary large language models (LLMs) embody substantial economic value and are generally exposed only as black-box APIs, yet adversaries can still exploit their outputs to extract knowledge via distillation. Existing defenses focus exclusively on text-based distillation, leaving the important logit-based distillation largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze this problem and present an effective solution from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize distillation-relevant information in teacher outputs using the conditional mutual information (CMI) between teacher logits and input queries conditioned on ground-truth labels. This quantity captures contextual information beneficial for model extraction, motivating us to defend distillation via CMI minimization. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we propose learning a transformation matrix that purifies the original outputs to enhance distillation resistance. We further derive a CMI-inspired anti-distillation objective to optimize this transformation, which effectively removes distillation-relevant information while preserving output utility. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and strong distillation algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method significantly degrades distillation performance while preserving task accuracy, effectively protecting models' intellectual property.

### 8. [Pursuing Best Industrial Practices for Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the Medical Domain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03368v1)

Authors: Wei Zhu

While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been swiftly adopted in industrial applications based on large language models (LLMs), there is no consensus on what are the best practices for building a RAG system in terms of what are the components, how to organize these components and how to implement each component for the industrial applications, especially in the medical domain. In this work, we first carefully analyze each component of the RAG system and propose practical alternatives for each component. Then, we conduct systematic evaluations on three types of tasks, revealing the best practices for improving the RAG system and how LLM-based RAG systems make trade-offs between performance and efficiency.

### 9. [Bridging Online and Offline RL: Contextual Bandit Learning for Multi-Turn Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03806v1)

Authors: Ziru Chen, Dongdong Chen, Ruinan Jin, Yingbin Liang, Yujia Xie, Huan Sun

Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/cobalt.

### 10. [FullStack-Agent: Enhancing Agentic Full-Stack Web Coding via Development-Oriented Testing and Repository Back-Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03798v1)

Authors: Zimu Lu, Houxing Ren, Yunqiao Yang, Ke Wang, Zhuofan Zong, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li

Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become a popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

### 1. [Detecting and Explaining Malware Family Evolution Using Rule-Based Drift Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03489v1)

Authors: Olha Jurečková, Martin Jureček

Malware detection and classification into families are critical tasks in cybersecurity, complicated by the continual evolution of malware to evade detection. This evolution introduces concept drift, in which the statistical properties of malware features change over time, reducing the effectiveness of static machine learning models. Understanding and explaining this drift is essential for maintaining robust and trustworthy malware detectors. In this paper, we propose an interpretable approach to concept drift detection. Our method uses a rule-based classifier to generate human-readable descriptions of both original and evolved malware samples belonging to the same malware family. By comparing the resulting rule sets using a similarity function, we can detect and quantify concept drift. Crucially, this comparison also identifies the specific features and feature values that have changed, providing clear explanations of how malware has evolved to bypass detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately detects drift but also provides actionable insights into the behavior of evolving malware families, supporting both detection and threat analysis.

Static Analysis Tools (SATs) are central to security engineering activities, as they enable early identification of code weaknesses without requiring execution. However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that such SATD-encoded information can be a meaningful complement to SAT-driven security analysis, while helping to overcome some of SATs' practical shortcomings.

Authors: Hao Li, Ruoyao Wen, Shanghao Shi, Ning Zhang, Chaowei Xiao

AI agents that autonomously interact with external tools and environments show great promise across real-world applications. However, the external data which agent consumes also leads to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in third-party content hijack agent behavior. Guided by benchmarks, such as AgentDojo, there has been significant amount of progress in developing defense against the said attacks. As the technology continues to mature, and that agents are increasingly being relied upon for more complex tasks, there is increasing pressing need to also evolve the benchmark to reflect threat landscape faced by emerging agentic systems. In this work, we reveal three fundamental flaws in current benchmarks and push the frontier along these dimensions: (i) lack of dynamic open-ended tasks, (ii) lack of helpful instructions, and (iii) simplistic user tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentDyn, a manually designed benchmark featuring 60 challenging open-ended tasks and 560 injection test cases across Shopping, GitHub, and Daily Life. Unlike prior static benchmarks, AgentDyn requires dynamic planning and incorporates helpful third-party instructions. Our evaluation of ten state-of-the-art defenses suggests that almost all existing defenses are either not secure enough or suffer from significant over-defense, revealing that existing defenses are still far from real-world deployment. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/leolee99/AgentDyn.

### 4. [The Trigger in the Haystack: Extracting and Reconstructing LLM Backdoor Triggers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03085v1)

Authors: Blake Bullwinkel, Giorgio Severi, Keegan Hines, Amanda Minnich, Ram Shankar Siva Kumar, Yonatan Zunger

Detecting whether a model has been poisoned is a longstanding problem in AI security. In this work, we present a practical scanner for identifying sleeper agent-style backdoors in causal language models. Our approach relies on two key findings: first, sleeper agents tend to memorize poisoning data, making it possible to leak backdoor examples using memory extraction techniques. Second, poisoned LLMs exhibit distinctive patterns in their output distributions and attention heads when backdoor triggers are present in the input. Guided by these observations, we develop a scalable backdoor scanning methodology that assumes no prior knowledge of the trigger or target behavior and requires only inference operations. Our scanner integrates naturally into broader defensive strategies and does not alter model performance. We show that our method recovers working triggers across multiple backdoor scenarios and a broad range of models and fine-tuning methods.

Authors: Alexander Loth, Dominique Conceicao Rosario, Peter Ebinger, Martin Kappes, Marc-Oliver Pahl

The proliferation of generative AI poses challenges for information integrity assurance, requiring systems that connect model governance with end-user verification. We present Origin Lens, a privacy-first mobile framework that targets visual disinformation through a layered verification architecture. Unlike server-side detection systems, Origin Lens performs cryptographic image provenance verification and AI detection locally on the device via a Rust/Flutter hybrid architecture. Our system integrates multiple signals - including cryptographic provenance, generative model fingerprints, and optional retrieval-augmented verification - to provide users with graded confidence indicators at the point of consumption. We discuss the framework's alignment with regulatory requirements (EU AI Act, DSA) and its role in verification infrastructure that complements platform-level mechanisms.

### 6. [LogicScan: An LLM-driven Framework for Detecting Business Logic Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03271v1)

Authors: Jiaqi Gao, Zijian Zhang, Yuqiang Sun, Ye Liu, Chengwei Liu, Han Liu, Yi Li, Yang Liu

Business logic vulnerabilities have become one of the most damaging yet least understood classes of smart contract vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional bugs such as reentrancy or arithmetic errors, these vulnerabilities arise from missing or incorrectly enforced business invariants and are tightly coupled with protocol semantics. Existing static analysis techniques struggle to capture such high-level logic, while recent large language model based approaches often suffer from unstable outputs and low accuracy due to hallucination and limited verification.
  In this paper, we propose LogicScan, an automated contrastive auditing framework for detecting business logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The key insight behind LogicScan is that mature, widely deployed on-chain protocols implicitly encode well-tested and consensus-driven business invariants. LogicScan systematically mines these invariants from large-scale on-chain contracts and reuses them as reference constraints to audit target contracts. To achieve this, LogicScan introduces a Business Specification Language (BSL) to normalize diverse implementation patterns into structured, verifiable logic representations. It further combines noise-aware logic aggregation with contrastive auditing to identify missing or weakly enforced invariants while mitigating LLM-induced false positives.
  We evaluate LogicScan on three real-world datasets, including DeFiHacks, Web3Bugs, and a set of top-200 audited contracts. The results show that LogicScan achieves an F1 score of 85.2%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art tools while maintaining a low false-positive rate on production-grade contracts. Additional experiments demonstrate that LogicScan maintains consistent performance across different LLMs and is cost-effective, and that its false-positive suppression mechanisms substantially improve robustness.

### 7. [On (Im)possibility of Network Oblivious Transfer via Noisy Channels and Non-Signaling Correlations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03421v1)

Authors: Hadi Aghaee, Christian Deppe, Holger Boche

This work investigates the fundamental limits of implementing network oblivious transfer via noisy multiple access channels and broadcast channels between honest-but-curious parties when the parties have access to general tripartite non-signaling correlations. By modeling the shared resource as an arbitrary tripartite non-signaling box, we obtain a unified perspective on both the channel behavior and the resulting correlations. Our main result demonstrates that perfect oblivious transfer is impossible. In the asymptotic regime, we further show that even negligible leakage cannot be achieved, as repeated use of the resource amplifies the receiver(s)'s ability to distinguish messages that were not intended for him/them. In contrast, the receiver(s)'s own privacy is not subject to a universal impossibility limitation.

### 8. [CVE-Factory: Scaling Expert-Level Agentic Tasks for Code Security Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03012v1)

Authors: Xianzhen Luo, Jingyuan Zhang, Shiqi Zhou, Rain Huang, Chuan Xiao, Qingfu Zhu, Zhiyuan Ma, Xing Yue, Yang Yue, Wencong Zeng, Wanxiang Che

Evaluating and improving the security capabilities of code agents requires high-quality, executable vulnerability tasks. However, existing works rely on costly, unscalable manual reproduction and suffer from outdated data distributions. To address these, we present CVE-Factory, the first multi-agent framework to achieve expert-level quality in automatically transforming sparse CVE metadata into fully executable agentic tasks. Cross-validation against human expert reproductions shows that CVE-Factory achieves 95\% solution correctness and 96\% environment fidelity, confirming its expert-level quality. It is also evaluated on the latest realistic vulnerabilities and achieves a 66.2\% verified success. This automation enables two downstream contributions. First, we construct LiveCVEBench, a continuously updated benchmark of 190 tasks spanning 14 languages and 153 repositories that captures emerging threats including AI-tooling vulnerabilities. Second, we synthesize over 1,000 executable training environments, the first large-scale scaling of agentic tasks in code security. Fine-tuned Qwen3-32B improves from 5.3\% to 35.8\% on LiveCVEBench, surpassing Claude 4.5 Sonnet, with gains generalizing to Terminal Bench (12.5\% to 31.3\%). We open-source CVE-Factory, LiveCVEBench, Abacus-cve (fine-tuned model), training dataset, and leaderboard. All resources are available at https://github.com/livecvebench/CVE-Factory .

### 9. [RPG-AE: Neuro-Symbolic Graph Autoencoders with Rare Pattern Mining for Provenance-Based Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02929v1)

Authors: Asif Tauhid, Sidahmed Benabderrahmane, Mohamad Altrabulsi, Ahamed Foisal, Talal Rahwan

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks that are difficult to detect because they operate stealthily and often blend into normal system behavior. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities in system-level provenance data. Our approach first constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors based on feature similarity, then learns normal relational structure using a Graph Autoencoder. Anomaly candidates are identified through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. To further improve detection, we integrate an rare pattern mining module that discovers infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and uses them to boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures. We evaluate the proposed method on the DARPA Transparent Computing datasets and show that rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over the baseline GAE. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches on the same benchmark, our single unified model consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors. These results highlight the value of coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining to improve both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection.

Authors: Zhihao Li, Boyang Ma, Xuelong Dai, Minghui Xu, Yue Zhang, Biwei Yan, Kun Li

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables large language models to invoke external tools through natural-language descriptions, forming the foundation of many AI agent applications. However, MCP does not enforce consistency between documented tool behavior and actual code execution, even though MCP Servers often run with broad system privileges. This gap introduces a largely unexplored security risk. We study how mismatches between externally presented tool descriptions and underlying implementations systematically shape the mental models and decision-making behavior of intelligent agents. Specifically, we present the first large-scale study of description-code inconsistency in the MCP ecosystem. We design an automated static analysis framework and apply it to 10,240 real-world MCP Servers across 36 categories. Our results show that while most servers are highly consistent, approximately 13% exhibit substantial mismatches that can enable undocumented privileged operations, hidden state mutations, or unauthorized financial actions. We further observe systematic differences across application categories, popularity levels, and MCP marketplaces. Our findings demonstrate that description-code inconsistency is a concrete and prevalent attack surface in MCP-based AI agents, and motivate the need for systematic auditing and stronger transparency guarantees in future agent ecosystems.

### Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

### 1. [FARTrack: Fast Autoregressive Visual Tracking with High Performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03214v1)

Authors: Guijie Wang, Tong Lin, Yifan Bai, Anjia Cao, Shiyi Liang, Wangbo Zhao, Xing Wei

Inference speed and tracking performance are two critical evaluation metrics in the field of visual tracking. However, high-performance trackers often suffer from slow processing speeds, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To alleviate this issue, we propose FARTrack, a Fast Auto-Regressive Tracking framework. Since autoregression emphasizes the temporal nature of the trajectory sequence, it can maintain high performance while achieving efficient execution across various devices. FARTrack introduces Task-Specific Self-Distillation and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification, designed from the perspectives of shallow-yet-accurate distillation and redundant-to-essential token optimization, respectively. Task-Specific Self-Distillation achieves model compression by distilling task-specific tokens layer by layer, enhancing the model's inference speed while avoiding suboptimal manual teacher-student layer pairs assignments. Meanwhile, Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification sequentially condenses multiple templates, avoiding additional runtime overhead while learning a temporally-global optimal sparsification strategy. FARTrack demonstrates outstanding speed and competitive performance. It delivers an AO of 70.6% on GOT-10k in real-time. Beyond, our fastest model achieves a speed of 343 FPS on the GPU and 121 FPS on the CPU.

### 2. [VIRAL: Visual In-Context Reasoning via Analogy in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03210v1)

Authors: Zhiwen Li, Zhongjie Duan, Jinyan Ye, Cen Chen, Daoyuan Chen, Yaliang Li, Yingda Chen

Replicating In-Context Learning (ICL) in computer vision remains challenging due to task heterogeneity. We propose \textbf{VIRAL}, a framework that elicits visual reasoning from a pre-trained image editing model by formulating ICL as conditional generation via visual analogy ($x_s : x_t :: x_q : y_q$). We adapt a frozen Diffusion Transformer (DiT) using role-aware multi-image conditioning and introduce a Mixture-of-Experts LoRA to mitigate gradient interference across diverse tasks. Additionally, to bridge the gaps in current visual context datasets, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning perception, restoration, and editing. Experiments demonstrate that VIRAL outperforms existing methods, validating that a unified V-ICL paradigm can handle the majority of visual tasks, including open-domain editing.

Authors: Yudong Han, Chao Xu, Xiaodan Ye, Weichen Bi, Zilong Dong, Yun Ma

We present WebSplatter, an end-to-end GPU rendering pipeline for the heterogeneous web ecosystem. Unlike naive ports, WebSplatter introduces a wait-free hierarchical radix sort that circumvents the lack of global atomics in WebGPU, ensuring deterministic execution across diverse hardware. Furthermore, we propose an opacity-aware geometry culling stage that dynamically prunes splats before rasterization, significantly reducing overdraw and peak memory footprint. Evaluation demonstrates that WebSplatter consistently achieves 1.2$\times$ to 4.5$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art web viewers.

### 4. [BinaryDemoire: Moiré-Aware Binarization for Image Demoiréing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03176v1)

Authors: Zheng Chen, Zhi Yang, Xiaoyang Liu, Weihang Zhang, Mengfan Wang, Yifan Fu, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang

Image demoiréing aims to remove structured moiré artifacts in recaptured imagery, where degradations are highly frequency-dependent and vary across scales and directions. While recent deep networks achieve high-quality restoration, their full-precision designs remain costly for deployment. Binarization offers an extreme compression regime by quantizing both activations and weights to 1-bit. Yet, it has been rarely studied for demoiréing and performs poorly when naively applied. In this work, we propose BinaryDemoire, a binarized demoiréing framework that explicitly accommodates the frequency structure of moiré degradations. First, we introduce a moiré-aware binary gate (MABG) that extracts lightweight frequency descriptors together with activation statistics. It predicts channel-wise gating coefficients to condition the aggregation of binary convolution responses. Second, we design a shuffle-grouped residual adapter (SGRA) that performs structured sparse shortcut alignment. It further integrates interleaved mixing to promote information exchange across different channel partitions. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BinaryDemoire surpasses current binarization methods. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/BinaryDemoire.

Authors: Xingyu Qiu, Xinghua Ma, Dong Liang, Gongning Luo, Wei Wang, Kuanquan Wang, Shuo Li

Deeply stacked KANs are practically impossible due to high training difficulties and substantial memory requirements. Consequently, existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the comprehensive exploration of KANs. This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to directly deeply stacked KAN, ALL U-KAN achieves 10 times reduction in parameter count and reduces memory consumption by more than 20 times, unlocking the new explorations into deep KAN architectures.

Authors: Chenxi Zhang, Ziliang Gan, Liyun Zhu, Youwei Pang, Qing Zhang, Rongjunchen Zhang

The financial domain poses substantial challenges for vision-language models (VLMs) due to specialized chart formats and knowledge-intensive reasoning requirements. However, existing financial benchmarks are largely single-turn and rely on a narrow set of question formats, limiting comprehensive evaluation in realistic application scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FinMTM, a multi-turn multimodal benchmark that expands diversity along both data and task dimensions. On the data side, we curate and annotate 11{,}133 bilingual (Chinese and English) financial QA pairs grounded in financial visuals, including candlestick charts, statistical plots, and report figures. On the task side, FinMTM covers single- and multiple-choice questions, multi-turn open-ended dialogues, and agent-based tasks. We further design task-specific evaluation protocols, including a set-overlap scoring rule for multiple-choice questions, a weighted combination of turn-level and session-level scores for multi-turn dialogues, and a composite metric that integrates planning quality with final outcomes for agent tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation of 22 VLMs reveal their limitations in fine-grained visual perception, long-context reasoning, and complex agent workflows.

### 7. [Beyond Cropping and Rotation: Automated Evolution of Powerful Task-Specific Augmentations with Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03123v1)

Authors: Judah Goldfeder, Shreyes Kaliyur, Vaibhav Sourirajan, Patrick Minwan Puma, Philippe Martin Wyder, Yuhang Hu, Jiong Lin, Hod Lipson

Data augmentation has long been a cornerstone for reducing overfitting in vision models, with methods like AutoAugment automating the design of task-specific augmentations. Recent advances in generative models, such as conditional diffusion and few-shot NeRFs, offer a new paradigm for data augmentation by synthesizing data with significantly greater diversity and realism. However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations. Our pipeline introduces a novel approach to image augmentation that learns stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling more structured and adaptive transformations. We demonstrate strong performance across fine-grained classification and few-shot learning tasks. Notably, our pipeline discovers augmentations that align with domain knowledge, even in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential of learned generative augmentations, unlocking new possibilities for robust model training.

### 8. [Thinking inside the Convolution for Image Inpainting: Reconstructing Texture via Structure under Global and Local Side](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03013v1)

Authors: Haipeng Liu, Yang Wang, Biao Qian, Yong Rui, Meng Wang

Image inpainting has earned substantial progress, owing to the encoder-and-decoder pipeline, which is benefited from the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with convolutional downsampling to inpaint the masked regions semantically from the known regions within the encoder, coupled with an upsampling process from the decoder for final inpainting output. Recent studies intuitively identify the high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture to be extracted by CNNs from the encoder, and subsequently for a desirable upsampling recovery. However, the existing arts inevitably overlook the information loss for both structure and texture feature maps during the convolutional downsampling process, hence suffer from a non-ideal upsampling output. In this paper, we systematically answer whether and how the structure and texture feature map can mutually help to alleviate the information loss during the convolutional downsampling. Given the structure and texture feature maps, we adopt the statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for the reconstruction guidance during the convolutional downsampling process. The extensive experimental results validate its advantages to the state-of-the-arts over the images from low-to-high resolutions including 256*256 and 512*512, especially holds by substituting all the encoders by ours.

Authors: Zhanfeng Liao, Jiajun Zhang, Hanzhang Tu, Zhixi Wang, Yunqi Gao, Hongwen Zhang, Yebin Liu

Novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes is fundamental to achieving photorealistic 4D reconstruction and immersive visual experiences. Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while supporting real-time rendering up to 4K resolution at 100 FPS on one RTX 4090.

Authors: Seok-Young Kim, Dooyoung Kim, Woojin Cho, Hail Song, Suji Kang, Woontack Woo

We introduce SceneLinker, a novel framework that generates compositional 3D scenes via semantic scene graph from RGB sequences. To adaptively experience Mixed Reality (MR) content based on each user's space, it is essential to generate a 3D scene that reflects the real-world layout by compactly capturing the semantic cues of the surroundings. Prior works struggled to fully capture the contextual relationship between objects or mainly focused on synthesizing diverse shapes, making it challenging to generate 3D scenes aligned with object arrangements. We address these challenges by designing a graph network with cross-check feature attention for scene graph prediction and constructing a graph-variational autoencoder (graph-VAE), which consists of a joint shape and layout block for 3D scene generation. Experiments on the 3RScan/3DSSG and SG-FRONT datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, even in complex indoor environments and under challenging scene graph constraints. Our work enables users to generate consistent 3D spaces from their physical environments via scene graphs, allowing them to create spatial MR content.

Authors: Jacopo Amidei, Gregorio Ferreira, Mario Muñoz Serrano, Rubén Nieto, Andreas Kaltenbrunner

This paper examines biases in large language models (LLMs) when generating synthetic populations from responses to personality questionnaires. Using five LLMs, we first assess the representativeness and potential biases in the sociodemographic attributes of the generated personas, as well as their alignment with the intended personality traits. While LLMs successfully reproduce known correlations between personality and sociodemographic variables, all models exhibit pronounced WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic) biases, favoring young, educated, white, heterosexual, Western individuals with centrist or progressive political views and secular or Christian beliefs. In a second analysis, we manipulate input traits to maximize Neuroticism and Psychoticism scores. Notably, when Psychoticism is maximized, several models produce an overrepresentation of non-binary and LGBTQ+ identities, raising concerns about stereotyping and the potential pathologization of marginalized groups. Our findings highlight both the potential and the risks of using LLMs to generate psychologically grounded synthetic populations.

Authors: Samantha Shorey, Benjamin Mako Hill, Samuel C. Woolley

Although socializing is a powerful driver of youth engagement online, platforms struggle to leverage engagement to promote learning. We seek to understand this dynamic using a multi-stage analysis of over 14,000 comments on Scratch, an online platform designed to support learning about programming. First, we inductively develop the concept of "participatory debugging" -- a practice through which users learn through collaborative technical troubleshooting. Second, we use a content analysis to establish how common the practice is on Scratch. Third, we conduct a qualitative analysis of user activity over time and identify three factors that serve as social antecedents of participatory debugging: (1) sustained community, (2) identifiable problems, and (3) what we call "topic porousness" to describe conversations that are able to span multiple topics. We integrate these findings in a theoretical framework that highlights a productive tension between the desire to promote learning and the interest-driven sub-communities that drive user engagement in many new media environments.

Authors: Bogdan Kulynych, Theresa Stadler, Jean Louis Raisaro, Carmela Troncoso

Recent advances in generative modelling have led many to see synthetic data as the go-to solution for a range of problems around data access, scarcity, and under-representation. In this paper, we study three prominent use cases: (1) Sharing synthetic data as a proxy for proprietary datasets to enable statistical analyses while protecting privacy, (2) Augmenting machine learning training sets with synthetic data to improve model performance, and (3) Augmenting datasets with synthetic data to reduce variance in statistical estimation. For each use case, we formalise the problem setting and study, through formal analysis and case studies, under which conditions synthetic data can achieve its intended objectives. We identify fundamental and practical limits that constrain when synthetic data can serve as an effective solution for a particular problem. Our analysis reveals that due to these limits many existing or envisioned use cases of synthetic data are a poor problem fit. Our formalisations and classification of synthetic data use cases enable decision makers to assess whether synthetic data is a suitable approach for their specific data availability problem.

Authors: Cornell Ziepel, Stephan Escher, Sebastian Rehms, Stefan Köpsell

Everyday services of society increasingly rely on mobile applications, resulting in a conflicting situation between the possibility of participation on the one side and user privacy and digital freedom on the other. In order to protect users' rights to informational self-determination, regulatory approaches for the collection and processing of personal data have been developed, such as the EU's GDPR. However, inspecting the compliance of mobile apps with privacy regulations remains difficult. Thus, in order to enable end users and enforcement bodies to verify and enforce data protection compliance, we propose mopri, a conceptual framework designed for analyzing the behavior of mobile apps through a comprehensive, adaptable, and user-centered approach. Recognizing the gaps in existing frameworks, mopri serves as a foundation for integrating various analysis tools into a streamlined, modular pipeline that employs static and dynamic analysis methods. Building on this concept, a prototype has been developed which effectively extracts permissions and tracking libraries while employing robust methods for dynamic traffic recording and decryption. Additionally, it incorporates result enrichment and reporting features that enhance the clarity and usability of the analysis outcomes. The prototype showcases the feasibility of a holistic and modular approach to privacy analysis, emphasizing the importance of continuous adaptation to the evolving challenges presented by the mobile app ecosystem.

Authors: Geeta Puri, Nachamma Socklingam, Dorien Herremans

Rapid innovations in AI and large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the adoption of digital learning, particularly beyond formal education. What began as an emergency response during COVID-19 has shifted from a supplementary resource to an essential pillar of education. Understanding how digital learning continues to evolve for adult and lifelong learners is therefore increasingly important.
  This study examines how various demographics interact with digital learning platforms, focusing on the learner motivations, the effectiveness of gamification in digital learning, and the integration of AI. Using multi survey data from 200 respondents and advanced analytics, our findings reveal a notable increase in the perceived relevance of digital learning after the pandemic, especially among young adults and women, coinciding with the rise of LLM-powered AI tools that support personalized learning.

Authors: Mayank Goel, Aritra Das, Paras Chopra

We build a custom transformer model to study how neural networks make moral decisions on trolley-style dilemmas. The model processes structured scenarios using embeddings that encode who is affected, how many people, and which outcome they belong to. Our 2-layer architecture achieves 77% accuracy on Moral Machine data while remaining small enough for detailed analysis. We use different interpretability techniques to uncover how moral reasoning distributes across the network, demonstrating that biases localize to distinct computational stages among other findings.

### 1. [A Pipeline for ADNI Resting-State Functional MRI Processing and Quality Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03278v1)

Authors: Saige Rutherford, Zeshawn Zahid, Robert C. Welsh, Andrea Avena-Koenigsberger, Vincent Koppelmans, Amanda F. Mejia

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) provides a comprehensive multimodal neuroimaging resource for studying aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since its second wave, ADNI has increasingly collected resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), a valuable resource for discovering brain connectivity changes predictive of cognitive decline and AD. A major barrier to its use is the considerable variability in acquisition protocols and data quality, compounded by missing imaging sessions and inconsistencies in how functional scans temporally align with clinical assessments. As a result, many studies only utilize a small subset of the total rs-fMRI data, limiting statistical power, reproducibility, and the ability to study longitudinal functional brain changes at scale. Here, we describe a pipeline for ADNI rs-fMRI data that encompasses the download of necessary imaging and clinical data, temporally aligning the clinical and imaging data, preprocessing, and quality control. We integrate data curation and preprocessing across all ADNI sites and scanner types using a combination of open-source software (Clinica, fMRIPrep, and MRIQC) and bespoke tools. Quality metrics and reports are generated for each subject and session to facilitate rigorous data screening. All scripts and configuration files are available to enable reproducibility. The pipeline, which currently supports ADNI-GO, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3 data releases, outputs high-quality rs-fMRI time series data adhering to the BIDS-derivatives specification. This protocol provides a transparent and scalable framework for curating and utilizing ADNI fMRI data, empowering large-scale functional biomarker discovery and integrative multimodal analyses in Alzheimer's disease research.

### 2. [Skill-Based Autonomous Agents for Material Creep Database Construction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03069v1)

Authors: Yue Wu, Tianhao Su, Shunbo Hu, Deng Pan

The advancement of data-driven materials science is currently constrained by a fundamental bottleneck: the vast majority of historical experimental data remains locked within the unstructured text and rasterized figures of legacy scientific literature. Manual curation of this knowledge is prohibitively labor-intensive and prone to human error. To address this challenge, we introduce an autonomous, agent-based framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) designed to excavate high-fidelity datasets from scientific PDFs without human intervention. By deploying a modular "skill-based" architecture, the agent orchestrates complex cognitive tasks - including semantic filtering, multi-modal information extraction, and physics-informed validation. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework by constructing a physically self-consistent database for material creep mechanics, a domain characterized by complex graphical trajectories and heterogeneous constitutive models. Applying the pipeline to 243 publications, the agent achieved a verified extraction success rate exceeding 90% for graphical data digitization. Crucially, we introduce a cross-modal verification protocol, demonstrating that the agent can autonomously align visually extracted data points with textually extracted constitutive parameters ($R^2 > 0.99$), ensuring the physical self-consistency of the database. This work not only provides a critical resource for investigating time-dependent deformation across diverse material systems but also establishes a scalable paradigm for autonomous knowledge acquisition, paving the way for the next generation of self-driving laboratories.

### 3. [ResQ: Realistic Performance-Aware Query Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02999v1)

Authors: Zhengle Wang, Yanfei Zhang, Chunwei Liu

Database research and development rely heavily on realistic user workloads for benchmarking, instance optimization, migration testing, and database tuning. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is notoriously challenging due to strict privacy regulations. While cloud database vendors have begun releasing anonymized performance traces to the research community, these traces typi- cally provide only high-level execution statistics without the origi- nal query text or data, which is insufficient for scenarios that require actual execution. Existing tools fail to capture fine-grained perfor- mance patterns or generate runnable workloads that reproduce these public traces with both high fidelity and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose ResQ, a fine-grained workload synthesis sys- tem designed to generate executable SQL workloads that faithfully match the per-query execution targets and operator distributions of production traces. ResQ constructs execution-aware query graphs, instantiates them into SQL via Bayesian Optimization-driven pred- icate search, and explicitly models workload repetition through reuse at both exact-query and parameterized-template levels. To ensure practical scalability, ResQ combines search-space bounding with lightweight local cost models to accelerate optimization. Ex- periments on public cloud traces (Snowset, Redset) and a newly released industrial trace (Bendset) demonstrate that ResQ signif- icantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 96.71% token savings and a 86.97% reduction in runtime, while lowering maximum Q-error by 14.8x on CPU time and 997.7x on scanned bytes, and closely matching operator composition.

### 4. [BIRDTurk: Adaptation of the BIRD Text-to-SQL Dataset to Turkish](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03633v1)

Authors: Burak Aktaş, Mehmet Can Baytekin, Süha Kağan Köse, Ömer İlbilgi, Elif Özge Yılmaz, Çağrı Toraman, Bilge Kaan Görür

Text-to-SQL systems have achieved strong performance on English benchmarks, yet their behavior in morphologically rich, low-resource languages remains largely unexplored. We introduce BIRDTurk, the first Turkish adaptation of the BIRD benchmark, constructed through a controlled translation pipeline that adapts schema identifiers to Turkish while strictly preserving the logical structure and execution semantics of SQL queries and databases. Translation quality is validated on a sample size determined by the Central Limit Theorem to ensure 95% confidence, achieving 98.15% accuracy on human-evaluated samples. Using BIRDTurk, we evaluate inference-based prompting, agentic multi-stage reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. Our results reveal that Turkish introduces consistent performance degradation, driven by both structural linguistic divergence and underrepresentation in LLM pretraining, while agentic reasoning demonstrates stronger cross-lingual robustness. Supervised fine-tuning remains challenging for standard multilingual baselines but scales effectively with modern instruction-tuned models. BIRDTurk provides a controlled testbed for cross-lingual Text-to-SQL evaluation under realistic database conditions. We release the training and development splits to support future research.

Authors: Yong Fang, Yuxing Han, Meng Wang, Yifan Zhang, Yue Ma, Chi Zhang

Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPSs) form the backbone of real-time processing and analytics at ByteDance, where Apache Flink powers one of the largest production clusters worldwide. Ensuring resiliency, the ability to withstand and rapidly recover from failures, together with operational stability, which provides consistent and predictable performance under normal conditions, is essential for meeting strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs). However, achieving resiliency and stability in large-scale production environments remains challenging due to the cluster scale, business diversity, and significant operational overhead. In this work, we present StreamShield, a production-proven resiliency solution deployed in ByteDance's Flink clusters. Designed along complementary perspectives of the engine and cluster, StreamShield introduces key techniques to enhance resiliency, covering runtime optimization, fine-grained fault-tolerance, hybrid replication strategy, and high availability under external systems. Furthermore, StreamShield proposes a robust testing and deployment pipeline that ensures reliability and robustness in production releases. Extensive evaluations on a production cluster demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of techniques proposed by StreamShield.

Authors: Mohammadali Khodabandehlou, Jared Coleman, Niranjan Suri, Bhaskar Krishnamachari

Dynamic scheduling of task graphs is often addressed without revisiting prior task allocations, with a primary focus on minimizing makespan. We study controlled schedule preemption, introducing the Last-K Preemption model, which selectively reschedules recent task graphs while preserving earlier allocations. Using synthetic, RIoTBench, WFCommons, and adversarial workloads, we compare preemptive, non-preemptive, and partial-preemptive strategies across makespan, fairness, utilization, and runtime. Results show moderate preemption can match most makespan and utilization gains of full preemption while maintaining fairness and low overhead.

### 2. [Large-Scale LLM Inference with Heterogeneous Workloads: Prefill-Decode Contention and Asymptotically Optimal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02987v1)

Authors: Ruihan Lin, Zezhen Ding, Zean Han, Jiheng Zhang

Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming critical infrastructure for enterprise applications, driving unprecedented demand for GPU-based inference services. A key operational challenge arises from the two-phase nature of LLM inference: a compute-intensive \emph{prefill} phase that processes user input, followed by a memory-bound \emph{decode} phase that generates output tokens. When these phases share GPU resources, prefill tasks throttle the processing speed of concurrent decodes, creating state-dependent contention. This contention is further complicated by workload heterogeneity, as different applications exhibit vastly different input and output lengths. We develop a stochastic control framework for scheduling heterogeneous LLM workloads across large GPU clusters. We formulate LLM inference as a multiclass many-server queueing network with state-dependent service rates, grounded in empirical iteration-time measurements. We analyze the fluid approximation of this system and solve steady-state linear programs that characterize optimal resource allocation. We design gate-and-route policies that regulate prefill admission and decode routing, and prove that they are asymptotically optimal in the many-GPU limit under both bundled and separate token-pricing schemes. We further extend the framework to incorporate Service Level Indicators (SLIs) such as latency and fairness, providing a general approach to constrained scheduling. Numerical experiments calibrated to empirical iteration-time data demonstrate that our policies outperform standard serving heuristics.

### 3. [Joint Network-and-Server Congestion in Multi-Source Traffic Allocation: A Convex Formulation and Price-Based Decentralization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03246v1)

Authors: Tamoghna Sarkar, Bhaskar Krishnamachari

This paper studies an important rate allocation problem that arises in many networked and distributed systems: steady-state traffic rate allocation from multiple sources to multiple service nodes when both (i) the access-path delay on each source-node route is rate-dependent (capacity-constrained) and convex, and (ii) each service node (also capacity-constrained) experiences a load-dependent queueing delay driven by aggregate load from all sources. We show that the resulting flow-weighted end-to-end delay minimization is a convex program, yielding a global system-optimal solution characterized by KKT conditions that equalize total marginal costs (a path marginal access term plus a node congestion price) across all utilized routes. This condition admits a Wardrop-type interpretation: for each source, all utilized options equalize total marginal cost, while any option with strictly larger total marginal cost receives no flow. Building on this structure, we develop a lightweight distributed pricing-based algorithm in which each service node locally computes and broadcasts a scalar congestion price from its observed aggregate load, while each source updates its traffic split by solving a small separable convex allocation problem under the advertised prices. Numerical illustrations demonstrate convergence of the distributed iteration to the centralized optimum and highlight the trade-offs induced by jointly modeling access and service congestion.

Authors: Shachar Meir, David Peleg

Agreement is a foundational problem in distributed computing that have been studied extensively for over four decades. Recently, Meir, Mirault, Peleg and Robinson introduced the notion of \emph{Energy Efficient Agreement}, where the goal is to solve Agreement while minimizing the number of round a party participates in, thereby reducing the energy cost per participant. We show a recursive Agreement algorithm that has $O(\log f)$ active rounds per participant, where $f<n$ represents the maximum number of crash faults in the system.

Authors: Grigory Begunov, Alexander Tyurin

Modern distributed optimization methods mostly rely on traditional synchronous approaches, despite substantial recent progress in asynchronous optimization. We revisit Synchronous SGD and its robust variant, called $m$-Synchronous SGD, and theoretically show that they are nearly optimal in many heterogeneous computation scenarios, which is somewhat unexpected. We analyze the synchronous methods under random computation times and adversarial partial participation of workers, and prove that their time complexities are optimal in many practical regimes, up to logarithmic factors. While synchronous methods are not universal solutions and there exist tasks where asynchronous methods may be necessary, we show that they are sufficient for many modern heterogeneous computation scenarios.

### 6. [Exploiting Multi-Core Parallelism in Blockchain Validation and Construction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03444v1)

Authors: Arivarasan Karmegam, Lucianna Kiffer, Antonio Fernández Anta

Blockchain validators can reduce block processing time by exploiting multi-core CPUs, but deterministic execution must preserve a given total order while respecting transaction conflicts and per-block runtime limits. This paper systematically examines how validators can exploit multi-core parallelism during both block construction and execution without violating blockchain semantics. We formalize two validator-side optimization problems: (i) executing an already ordered block on \(p\) cores to minimize makespan while ensuring equivalence to sequential execution; and (ii) selecting and scheduling a subset of mempool transactions under a runtime limit \(B\) to maximize validator reward. For both, we develop exact Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations that capture conflict, order, and capacity constraints, and propose fast deterministic heuristics that scale to realistic workloads. Using Ethereum mainnet traces and including a Solana-inspired declared-access baseline (Sol) for ordered-block scheduling and a simple reward-greedy baseline (RG) for block construction, we empirically quantify the trade-offs between optimality and runtime.

### 7. [DALI: A Workload-Aware Offloading Framework for Efficient MoE Inference on Local PCs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03495v1)

Authors: Zeyu Zhu, Gang Li, Peisong Wang, Zitao Mo, Minnan Pei, Zhuoran Song, Xiaoyao Liang, Jian Cheng

Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures significantly enhance the capacity of LLMs without proportional increases in computation, but at the cost of a vast parameter size. Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dynamics, resulting in poor hit rates and limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose DALI, a workloaDAware offLoadIng framework for efficient MoE inference on local PCs. To fully utilize hardware resources, DALI first dynamically assigns experts to CPU or GPU by modeling assignment as a 0-1 integer optimization problem and solving it efficiently using a Greedy Assignment strategy at runtime. To improve prefetching accuracy, we develop a Residual-Based Prefetching method leveraging inter-layer residual information to accurately predict high-workload experts. Additionally, we introduce a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy that exploits temporal correlation in expert activations to improve GPU cache efficiency. By evaluating across various MoE models and settings, DALI achieves significant speedups in the both prefill and decoding phases over the state-of-the-art offloading frameworks.

### 9. [Mitigating Staleness in Asynchronous Pipeline Parallelism via Basis Rotation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03515v1)

Authors: Hyunji Jung, Sungbin Shin, Namhoon Lee

Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline.

### 10. [Improved Analysis of the Accelerated Noisy Power Method with Applications to Decentralized PCA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03682v1)

Authors: Pierre Aguié, Mathieu Even, Laurent Massoulié

We analyze the Accelerated Noisy Power Method, an algorithm for Principal Component Analysis in the setting where only inexact matrix-vector products are available, which can arise for instance in decentralized PCA. While previous works have established that acceleration can improve convergence rates compared to the standard Noisy Power Method, these guarantees require overly restrictive upper bounds on the magnitude of the perturbations, limiting their practical applicability. We provide an improved analysis of this algorithm, which preserves the accelerated convergence rate under much milder conditions on the perturbations. We show that our new analysis is worst-case optimal, in the sense that the convergence rate cannot be improved, and that the noise conditions we derive cannot be relaxed without sacrificing convergence guarantees. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our results by deriving an accelerated algorithm for decentralized PCA, which has similar communication costs to non-accelerated methods. To our knowledge, this is the first decentralized algorithm for PCA with provably accelerated convergence.

High-quality scientific illustrations are crucial for effectively communicating complex scientific and technical concepts, yet their manual creation remains a well-recognized bottleneck in both academia and industry. We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal. Leveraging the high-quality data from FigureBench, we conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of AutoFigure against various baseline methods. The results demonstrate that AutoFigure consistently surpasses all baseline methods, producing publication-ready scientific illustrations. The code, dataset and huggingface space are released in https://github.com/ResearAI/AutoFigure.

Authors: Florian Ingels, Antoine Limasset, Camille Marchet, Mikaël Salson

In bioinformatics, minimizers have become an inescapable method for handling $k$-mers (words of fixed size $k$) extracted from DNA or RNA sequencing, whether for sampling, storage, querying or partitioning. According to some fixed order on $m$-mers ($m<k$), the minimizer of a $k$-mer is defined as its smallest $m$-mer -- and acts as its fingerprint. Although minimizers are widely used for partitioning purposes, there is almost no theoretical work on the quality of the resulting partitions. For instance, it has been known for decades that the lexicographic order empirically leads to highly unbalanced partitions that are unusable in practice, but it was not until very recently that this observation was theoretically substantiated. The rejection of the lexicographic order has led the community to resort to (pseudo-)random orders using hash functions. In this work, we extend the theoretical results relating to the partitions obtained by the lexicographical order, departing from it to a (exponentially) large family of hash functions, namely where the $m$-mers are XORed against a fixed key. More precisely, provided a key $γ$ and a $m$-mer $w$, we investigate the function that counts how many $k$-mers admit $w$ as their minimizer (i.e. where $w\oplusγ$ is minimal among all $m$-mers of said $k$-mers). This number, denoted by $π_k^γ(w)$, represents the maximum size of the bucket associated with $w$, if all possible $k$-mers were to be seen and partitioned. We adapt the (lexicographical order) method of the literature to our framework and propose combinatorial equations that allow to compute, using dynamic programming, $π_k^γ(w)$ in $O(km^2)$ time and $O(km)$ space.

### 2. [Factor-balancedness, linear recurrence, and factor complexity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03746v1)

Authors: Bastiàn Espinoza, Pierre Popoli, Manon Stipulanti

In the study of infinite words, various notions of balancedness provide quantitative measures for how regularly letters or factors occur, and they find applications in several areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. In this paper, we study factor-balancedness and uniform factor-balancedness, making two main contributions. First, we establish general sufficient conditions for an infinite word to be (uniformly) factor-balanced, applicable in particular to any given linearly recurrent word. These conditions are formulated in terms of $\mathcal{S}$-adic representations and generalize results of Adamczewski on primitive substitutive words, which show that balancedness of length-2 factors already implies uniform factor-balancedness. As an application of our criteria, we characterize the Sturmian words and ternary Arnoux--Rauzy words that are uniformly factor-balanced as precisely those with bounded weak partial quotients. Our second main contribution is a study of the relationship between factor-balancedness and factor complexity. In particular, we analyze the non-primitive substitutive case and construct an example of a factor-balanced word with exponential factor complexity, thereby making progress on a question raised in 2025 by Arnoux, Berthé, Minervino, Steiner, and Thuswaldner on the relation between balancedness and discrete spectrum.

### 3. [An Algorithm for Monitoring Edge-geodetic Sets in Chordal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03288v1)

Authors: Nacim Oijid, Clara Marcille

A monitoring edge-geodetic set (or meg-set for short) of a graph is a set of vertices $M$ such that if any edge is removed, then the distance between some two vertices of $M$ increases. This notion was introduced by Foucaud et al. in 2023 as a way to monitor networks for communication failures. As computing a minimal meg-set is hard in general, recent works aimed to find polynomial-time algorithms to compute minimal meg-sets when the input belongs to a restricted class of graphs. Most of these results are based on the property of some classes of graphs to admit a unique minimum meg-set, which is then easy to compute. In this work, we prove that chordal graphs also admit a unique minimal meg-set, answering a standing open question of Foucaud et al.

Authors: Quentin Claus, Jędrzej Hodor, Gwenaël Joret, Pat Morin

We show that every graph $G$ excluding an apex-forest $H$ as a minor has layered pathwidth at most $|V(H)|-2$, and that every graph $G$ excluding an apex-linear forest (such as a fan) $H$ as a minor has layered treedepth at most $|V(H)|-2$. We further show that both bounds are optimal. These results improve on recent results of Hodor, La, Micek, and Rambaud (2025): The first result improves the previous best-known bound by a multiplicative factor of $2$, while the second strengthens a previous quadratic bound. In addition, we reduce from quadratic to linear the bound on the $S$-focused treedepth $\mathrm{td}(G,S)$ for graphs $G$ with a prescribed set of vertices $S$ excluding models of paths in which every branch set intersects~$S$.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

### 1. [Perfect Network Resilience in Polynomial Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03827v1)

Authors: Matthias Bentert, Stefan Schmid

Modern communication networks support local fast rerouting mechanisms to quickly react to link failures: nodes store a set of conditional rerouting rules which define how to forward an incoming packet in case of incident link failures. The rerouting decisions at any node $v$ must rely solely on local information available at $v$: the link from which a packet arrived at $v$, the target of the packet, and the incident link failures at $v$. Ideally, such rerouting mechanisms provide perfect resilience: any packet is routed from its source to its target as long as the two are connected in the underlying graph after the link failures. Already in their seminal paper at ACM PODC '12, Feigenbaum, Godfrey, Panda, Schapira, Shenker, and Singla showed that perfect resilience cannot always be achieved. While the design of local rerouting algorithms has received much attention since then, we still lack a detailed understanding of when perfect resilience is achievable.
  This paper closes this gap and presents a complete characterization of when perfect resilience can be achieved. This characterization also allows us to design an $O(n)$-time algorithm to decide whether a given instance is perfectly resilient and an $O(nm)$-time algorithm to compute perfectly resilient rerouting rules whenever it is. Our algorithm is also attractive for the simple structure of the rerouting rules it uses, known as skipping in the literature: alternative links are chosen according to an ordered priority list (per in-port), where failed links are simply skipped. Intriguingly, our result also implies that in the context of perfect resilience, skipping rerouting rules are as powerful as more general rerouting rules. This partially answers a long-standing open question by Chiesa, Nikolaevskiy, Mitrovic, Gurtov, Madry, Schapira, and Shenker [IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 2017] in the affirmative.

### 2. [Fast-MWEM: Private Data Release in Sublinear Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03732v1)

Authors: Themistoklis Haris, Steve Choi, Mutiraj Laksanawisit

The Multiplicative Weights Exponential Mechanism (MWEM) is a fundamental iterative framework for private data analysis, with broad applications such as answering $m$ linear queries, or privately solving systems of $m$ linear constraints. However, a critical bottleneck hindering its scalability is the $Θ(m)$ time complexity required to execute the exponential mechanism in each iteration. We introduce a modification to the MWEM framework that improves the per-iteration runtime dependency to $Θ(\sqrt{m})$ in expectation. This is done via a lazy sampling approach to the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism, which we implement efficiently using Gumbel noise and a $k$-Nearest Neighbor data structure. This allows for the rapid selection of the approximate score in the exponential mechanism without an exhaustive linear scan. We apply our accelerated framework to the problems of private linear query release and solving Linear Programs (LPs) under neighboring constraint conditions and low-sensitivity assumptions. Experimental evaluation confirms that our method provides a substantial runtime improvement over classic MWEM.

Authors: Dylan Herman, Yue Sun, Jin-Peng Liu, Marco Pistoia, Charlie Che, Rob Otter, Shouvanik Chakrabarti, Aram Harrow

This paper explores advancements in quantum algorithms for derivative pricing of exotics, a computational pipeline of fundamental importance in quantitative finance. For such cases, the classical Monte Carlo integration procedure provides the state-of-the-art provable, asymptotic performance: polynomial in problem dimension and quadratic in inverse-precision. While quantum algorithms are known to offer quadratic speedups over classical Monte Carlo methods, end-to-end speedups have been proven only in the simplified setting over the Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model. This paper extends existing frameworks to demonstrate novel quadratic speedups for more practical models, such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and a variant of Heston's stochastic volatility model, utilizing a characteristic of the underlying SDEs which we term fast-forwardability. Additionally, for general models that do not possess the fast-forwardable property, we introduce a quantum Milstein sampler, based on a novel quantum algorithm for sampling Lévy areas, which enables quantum multi-level Monte Carlo to achieve quadratic speedups for multi-dimensional stochastic processes exhibiting certain correlation types.
  We also present an improved analysis of numerical integration for derivative pricing, leading to substantial reductions in the resource requirements for pricing GBM and CIR models. Furthermore, we investigate the potential for additional reductions using arithmetic-free quantum procedures. Finally, we critique quantum partial differential equation (PDE) solvers as a method for derivative pricing based on amplitude estimation, identifying theoretical barriers that obstruct achieving a quantum speedup through this approach. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of quantum algorithms in derivative pricing, addressing key challenges and open questions in the field.

Blockchain validators can reduce block processing time by exploiting multi-core CPUs, but deterministic execution must preserve a given total order while respecting transaction conflicts and per-block runtime limits. This paper systematically examines how validators can exploit multi-core parallelism during both block construction and execution without violating blockchain semantics. We formalize two validator-side optimization problems: (i) executing an already ordered block on \(p\) cores to minimize makespan while ensuring equivalence to sequential execution; and (ii) selecting and scheduling a subset of mempool transactions under a runtime limit \(B\) to maximize validator reward. For both, we develop exact Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations that capture conflict, order, and capacity constraints, and propose fast deterministic heuristics that scale to realistic workloads. Using Ethereum mainnet traces and including a Solana-inspired declared-access baseline (Sol) for ordered-block scheduling and a simple reward-greedy baseline (RG) for block construction, we empirically quantify the trade-offs between optimality and runtime.

### 5. [On the Complexity of Maximal/Closed Frequent Tree Mining for Bounded Height Trees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03436v1)

Authors: Kenta Komoto, Kazuhiro Kurita, Hirotaka Ono

In this paper, we address the problem of enumerating all frequent maximal/closed trees. This is a classical and central problem in data mining. Although many practical algorithms have been developed for this problem, its complexity under ``realistic assumptions'' on tree height has not been clarified. More specifically, while it was known that the mining problem becomes hard when the tree height is at least 60, the complexity for cases where the tree height is smaller has not yet been clarified. We resolve this gap by establishing results for these tree mining problems under several settings, including ordered and unordered trees, as well as maximal and closed variants.

### 6. [Vigemers: on the number of $k$-mers sharing the same XOR-based minimizer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03337v1)

Authors: Florian Ingels, Antoine Limasset, Camille Marchet, Mikaël Salson

In bioinformatics, minimizers have become an inescapable method for handling $k$-mers (words of fixed size $k$) extracted from DNA or RNA sequencing, whether for sampling, storage, querying or partitioning. According to some fixed order on $m$-mers ($m<k$), the minimizer of a $k$-mer is defined as its smallest $m$-mer -- and acts as its fingerprint. Although minimizers are widely used for partitioning purposes, there is almost no theoretical work on the quality of the resulting partitions. For instance, it has been known for decades that the lexicographic order empirically leads to highly unbalanced partitions that are unusable in practice, but it was not until very recently that this observation was theoretically substantiated. The rejection of the lexicographic order has led the community to resort to (pseudo-)random orders using hash functions. In this work, we extend the theoretical results relating to the partitions obtained by the lexicographical order, departing from it to a (exponentially) large family of hash functions, namely where the $m$-mers are XORed against a fixed key. More precisely, provided a key $γ$ and a $m$-mer $w$, we investigate the function that counts how many $k$-mers admit $w$ as their minimizer (i.e. where $w\oplusγ$ is minimal among all $m$-mers of said $k$-mers). This number, denoted by $π_k^γ(w)$, represents the maximum size of the bucket associated with $w$, if all possible $k$-mers were to be seen and partitioned. We adapt the (lexicographical order) method of the literature to our framework and propose combinatorial equations that allow to compute, using dynamic programming, $π_k^γ(w)$ in $O(km^2)$ time and $O(km)$ space.

### 7. [ZOR filters: fast and smaller than fuse filters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03525v1)

Authors: Antoine Limasset

Probabilistic membership filters support fast approximate membership queries with a controlled false-positive probability $\varepsilon$ and are widely used across storage, analytics, networking, and bioinformatics \cite{chang2008bigtable,dayan2018optimalbloom,broder2004network,harris2020improved,marchet2023scalable,chikhi2025logan,hernandez2025reindeer2}. In the static setting, state-of-the-art designs such as XOR and fuse filters achieve low overhead and very fast queries, but their peeling-based construction succeeds only with high probability, which complicates deterministic builds \cite{graf2020xor,graf2022binary,ulrich2023taxor}.
  We introduce \emph{ZOR filters}, a deterministic continuation of XOR/fuse filters that guarantees construction termination while preserving the same XOR-based query mechanism. ZOR replaces restart-on-failure with deterministic peeling that abandons a small fraction of keys, and restores false-positive-only semantics by storing the remainder in a compact auxiliary structure. In our experiments, the abandoned fraction drops below $1\%$ for moderate arity (e.g., $N\ge 5$), so the auxiliary handles a negligible fraction of keys. As a result, ZOR filters can achieve overhead within $1\%$ of the information-theoretic lower bound $\log_2(1/\varepsilon)$ while retaining fuse-like query performance; the additional cost is concentrated on negative queries due to the auxiliary check. Our current prototype builds several-fold slower than highly optimized fuse builders because it maintains explicit incidence information during deterministic peeling; closing this optimisation gap is an engineering target.

Authors: Yoonsang Kim, Divyansh Pradhan, Devshree Jadeja, Arie Kaufman

We introduce Speech-to-Spatial, a referent disambiguation framework that converts verbal remote-assistance instructions into spatially grounded AR guidance. Unlike prior systems that rely on additional cues (e.g., gesture, gaze) or manual expert annotations, Speech-to-Spatial infers the intended target solely from spoken references (speech input). Motivated by our formative study of speech referencing patterns, we characterize recurring ways people specify targets (Direct Attribute, Relational, Remembrance, and Chained) and ground them to our object-centric relational graph. Given an utterance, referent cues are parsed and rendered as persistent in-situ AR visual guidance, reducing iterative micro-guidance ("a bit more to the right", "now, stop.") during remote guidance. We demonstrate the use cases of our system with remote guided assistance and intent disambiguation scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Speechto-Spatial improves task efficiency, reduces cognitive load, and enhances usability compared to a conventional voice-only baseline, transforming disembodied verbal instruction into visually explainable, actionable guidance on a live shared view.

### 2. [How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03546v1)

Authors: Jonathan Lin, Aman Desai, Frank Barrows, Francesco Caravelli

Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.

### 1. [A vector logic for intensional formal semantics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02940v1)

Authors: Daniel Quigley

Formal semantics and distributional semantics are distinct approaches to linguistic meaning: the former models meaning as reference via model-theoretic structures; the latter represents meaning as vectors in high-dimensional spaces shaped by usage. This paper proves that these frameworks are structurally compatible for intensional semantics. We establish that Kripke-style intensional models embed injectively into vector spaces, with semantic functions lifting to (multi)linear maps that preserve composition. The construction accommodates multiple index sorts (worlds, times, locations) via a compound index space, representing intensions as linear operators. Modal operators are derived algebraically: accessibility relations become linear operators, and modal conditions reduce to threshold checks on accumulated values. For uncountable index domains, we develop a measure-theoretic generalization in which necessity becomes truth almost everywhere and possibility becomes truth on a set of positive measure, a non-classical logic natural for continuous parameters.

### 2. [A Probabilistic Model-Checking Framework for Cognitive Assessment and Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03643v1)

Authors: Elisabetta De Maria, Christopher Leturc

Serious games have proven to be effective tools for screening cognitive impairments and supporting diagnosis in patients with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. They also offer cognitive training benefits. According to the DSM-5 classification, cognitive disorders are categorized as Mild Neurocognitive Disorders (mild NCDs) and Major Neurocognitive Disorders (Major NCDs). In this study, we focus on three patient groups: healthy, mild NCD, and Major NCD. We employ Discrete Time Markov Chains to model the behavior exhibited by each group while interacting with serious games. By applying model-checking techniques, we can identify discrepancies between expected and actual gameplay behavior. The primary contribution of this work is a novel theoretical framework designed to assess how a practitioner's confidence level in diagnosing a patient's Alzheimer's stage evolves with each game session (diagnosis support). Additionally, we propose an experimental protocol where the difficulty of subsequent game sessions is dynamically adjusted based on the patient's observed behavior in previous sessions (training support).

### 3. [Formal Evidence Generation for Assurance Cases for Robotic Software Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03550v1)

Authors: Fang Yan, Simon Foster, Ana Cavalcanti, Ibrahim Habli, James Baxter

Robotics and Autonomous Systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, so that demonstrating their safety is essential. Assurance Cases (ACs) provide structured arguments supported by evidence, but generating and maintaining this evidence is labour-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to keep consistent as systems evolve. We present a model-based approach to systematically generating AC evidence by embedding formal verification into the assurance workflow. The approach addresses three challenges: systematically deriving formal assertions from natural language requirements using templates, orchestrating multiple formal verification tools to handle diverse property types, and integrating formal evidence production into the workflow. Leveraging RoboChart, a domain-specific modelling language with formal semantics, we combine model checking and theorem proving in our approach. Structured requirements are automatically transformed into formal assertions using predefined templates, and verification results are automatically integrated as evidence. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Authors: Alon Wolf, Chen Katzir, Kfir Aberman, Or Patashnik

Diffusion-based editing models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic image and video manipulation. However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets.

### 2. [See-through: Single-image Layer Decomposition for Anime Characters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03749v1)

Authors: Jian Lin, Chengze Li, Haoyun Qin, Kwun Wang Chan, Yanghua Jin, Hanyuan Liu, Stephen Chun Wang Choy, Xueting Liu

We introduce a framework that automates the transformation of static anime illustrations into manipulatable 2.5D models. Current professional workflows require tedious manual segmentation and the artistic ``hallucination'' of occluded regions to enable motion. Our approach overcomes this by decomposing a single image into fully inpainted, semantically distinct layers with inferred drawing orders. To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry. Our methodology couples a diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module, which enforces global geometric coherence, with a pixel-level pseudo-depth inference mechanism. This combination resolves the intricate stratification of anime characters, e.g., interleaving hair strands, allowing for dynamic layer reconstruction. We demonstrate that our approach yields high-fidelity, manipulatable models suitable for professional, real-time animation applications.

Authors: Yudong Han, Chao Xu, Xiaodan Ye, Weichen Bi, Zilong Dong, Yun Ma

We present WebSplatter, an end-to-end GPU rendering pipeline for the heterogeneous web ecosystem. Unlike naive ports, WebSplatter introduces a wait-free hierarchical radix sort that circumvents the lack of global atomics in WebGPU, ensuring deterministic execution across diverse hardware. Furthermore, we propose an opacity-aware geometry culling stage that dynamically prunes splats before rasterization, significantly reducing overdraw and peak memory footprint. Evaluation demonstrates that WebSplatter consistently achieves 1.2$\times$ to 4.5$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art web viewers.

### 4. [Occlusion-Free Conformal Lensing for Spatiotemporal Visualization in 3D Urban Analytics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03743v1)

Authors: Roberta Mota, Julio D. Silva, Fabio Miranda, Usman Alim, Ehud Sharlin, Nivan Ferreira

The visualization of temporal data on urban buildings, such as shadows, noise, and solar potential, plays a critical role in the analysis of dynamic urban phenomena. However, in dense and geographically constrained 3D urban environments, visual representations of time-varying building data often suffer from occlusion and visual clutter. To address these two challenges, we introduce an immersive lens visualization that integrates a view-dependent cutaway de-occlusion technique and a temporal display derived from a conformal mapping algorithm. The mapping process first partitions irregular building footprints into smaller, sufficiently regular subregions that serve as structural primitives. These subregions are then seamlessly recombined to form a conformal, layered layout for our temporal lens visualization. The view-responsive cutaway is inspired by traditional architectural illustrations, preserving the overall layout of the building and its surroundings to maintain users' sense of spatial orientation. This lens design enables the occlusion-free embedding of shape-adaptive temporal displays across building facades on demand, supporting rapid time-space association for the discovery, access and interpretation of spatiotemporal urban patterns. Guided by domain and design goals, we outline the rationale behind the lens visual and interaction design choices, such as the encoding of time progression and temporal values in the conforming lens image. A user study compares our approach against conventional juxtaposition and x-ray spatiotemporal designs. Results validate the usage and utility of our lens, showing that it improves task accuracy and completion time, reduces navigation effort, and increases user confidence. From these findings, we distill design recommendations and promising directions for future research on spatially-embedded lenses in 3D visualization and urban analytics.

### 5. [Point Vortex Dynamics on Closed Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03684v1)

Authors: Marcel Padilla

The theory of point vortex dynamics has existed since Kirchhoff's proposal in 1891 and is still under development with connections to many fields in mathematics. As a strong simplification of the concept of vorticity it excels in computational speed for vorticity based fluid simulations at the cost of accuracy. Recent finding by Stefanella Boatto and Jair Koiller allowed the extension of this theory on to closed surfaces. A comprehensive guide to point vortex dynamics on closed surfaces with genus zero and vanishing total vorticity is presented here. Additionally fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics and surfaces are explained in a way to unify the theory of point vortex dynamics of the plane, the sphere and closed surfaces together with implementation details and supplement material.

### 6. [Pi-GS: Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting with Dense π^3 Initialization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03327v1)

Authors: Manuel Hofer, Markus Steinberger, Thomas Köhler

Novel view synthesis has evolved rapidly, advancing from Neural Radiance Fields to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which offers real-time rendering and rapid training without compromising visual fidelity. However, 3DGS relies heavily on accurate camera poses and high-quality point cloud initialization, which are difficult to obtain in sparse-view scenarios. While traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) pipelines often fail in these settings, existing learning-based point estimation alternatives typically require reliable reference views and remain sensitive to pose or depth errors. In this work, we propose a robust method utilizing π^3, a reference-free point cloud estimation network. We integrate dense initialization from π^3 with a regularization scheme designed to mitigate geometric inaccuracies. Specifically, we employ uncertainty-guided depth supervision, normal consistency loss, and depth warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Tanks and Temples, LLFF, DTU, and MipNeRF360 datasets.

### 7. [Role of Graphics in Disaster Communication: Practitioner Perspectives on Use, Challenges, and Inclusivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02947v1)

Authors: Anuradha Madugall, Yuqing Xiao, John Grundy

Information graphics, such as hazard maps, evacuation diagrams, and pictorial action guides, are widely used in disaster risk communication. These visuals are important because they convey hazard information quickly, reduce reliance on lengthy text, and support decision-making in time-critical situations. However, despite their importance, disaster information graphics do not work equally well for all audiences. In practice, many graphics remain difficult to interpret, and their accessibility for vulnerable populations is still uneven and underexplored. Despite their central role, there has been little empirical work examining how graphics shape disaster communication, what challenges practitioners face in using them, and, most importantly, how inclusive current disaster graphics are in real-world settings. To address this gap, we examine how information graphics are currently produced and used in disaster communication, what issues emerge in practice, and how inclusivity is addressed. We conducted semi-structured interviews with disaster communication practitioners and researchers to examine the role of graphics across preparedness, warning, and response contexts, as well as the barriers experienced by vulnerable communities. Our findings show that graphics are widely expected and heavily relied upon, yet significant accessibility gaps persist for groups such as people with vision impairments, older adults, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Participants also highlighted that inclusive adaptations are difficult to achieve during unfolding emergencies due to operational constraints, limited guidance, and resource barriers. Based on these findings, we outline recommendations for disaster management agencies and graphic designers and identify research directions for technological and adaptive support to make disaster graphics more inclusive at scale.

### 1. [Sequential Linear Contracts on Matroids](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03543v1)

Authors: Kanstantsin Pashkovich, Jacob Skitsko, Yun Xing

In this work, we study sequential contracts under matroid constraints. In the sequential setting, an agent can take actions one by one. After each action, the agent observes the stochastic value of the action and then decides which action to take next, if any. At the end, the agent decides what subset of taken actions to use for the principal's reward; and the principal receives the total value of this subset as a reward. Taking each action induces a certain cost for the agent. Thus, to motivate the agent to take actions the principal is expected to offer an appropriate contract. A contract describes the payment from the principal to the agent as a function of the principal's reward obtained through the agent's actions. In this work, we concentrate on studying linear contracts, i.e.\ the contracts where the principal transfers a fraction of their total reward to the agent. We assume that the total principal's reward is calculated based on a subset of actions that forms an independent set in a given matroid. We establish a relationship between the problem of finding an optimal linear contract (or computing the corresponding principal's utility) and the so called matroid (un)reliability problem. Generally, the above problems turn out to be equivalent subject to adding parallel copies of elements to the given matroid.

Authors: Axel Benyamine, Julien Grand-Clément, Marek Petrik, Michael I. Jordan, Alain Durmus

In this paper, we propose a general theory of ambiguity-averse MDPs, which treats the uncertain transition probabilities as random variables and evaluates a policy via a risk measure applied to its random return. This ambiguity-averse MDP framework unifies several models of MDPs with epistemic uncertainty for specific choices of risk measures. We extend the concepts of value functions and Bellman operators to our setting. Based on these objects, we establish the consequences of dynamic programming principles in this framework (existence of stationary policies, value and policy iteration algorithms), and we completely characterize law-invariant risk measures compatible with dynamic programming. Our work draws connections among several variants of MDP models and fully delineates what is possible under the dynamic programming paradigm and which risk measures require leaving it.

### 3. [Efficient Investment in Multi-Agent Models of Public Transportation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03687v1)

Authors: Martin Bullinger, Edith Elkind, Kassian Köck

We study two stylized, multi-agent models aimed at investing a limited, indivisible resource in public transportation. In the first model, we face the decision of which potential stops to open along a (e.g., bus) path, given agents' travel demands. While it is known that utilitarian optimal solutions can be identified in polynomial time, we find that computing approximately optimal solutions with respect to egalitarian welfare is NP-complete. This is surprising as we operate on the simple topology of a line graph.
  In the second model, agents navigate a more complex network modeled by a weighted graph where edge weights represent distances. We face the decision of improving travel time along a fixed number of edges. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that combines Dijkstra's algorithm with a dynamical program to find the optimal decision for one or two agents. By contrast, if the number of agents is variable, we find \np-completeness and inapproximability results for utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Moreover, we demonstrate implications of our results for a related model of railway network design.

### 4. [Game-Theoretic and Algorithmic Analyses of Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Costs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03455v1)

Authors: Tesshu Hanaka, Nikolaos Melissinos, Hirotaka Ono

Coordinating the movement of multiple autonomous agents over a shared network is a fundamental challenge in algorithmic robotics, intelligent transportation, and distributed systems. The dominant approach, Multi-Agent Path Finding, relies on centralized control and synchronous collision avoidance, which often requires strict synchronization and guarantees of globally conflict-free execution. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Cost model on mixed graphs, a novel framework tailored to asynchronous settings. In our model, instead of treating conflicts as hard constraints, each agent is assigned a path, and the system is evaluated through a cost function that measures potential head-on encounters. This ``crossing cost'', which is defined as the product of the numbers of agents traversing an edge in opposite directions, quantifies the risk of congestion and delay in decentralized execution.
  Our contributions are both game-theoretic and algorithmic. We model the setting as a congestion game with a non-standard cost function, prove the existence of pure Nash equilibria, and analyze the dynamics leading to them. Equilibria can be found in polynomial time under mild conditions, while the general case is PLS-complete. From an optimization perspective, minimizing the total crossing cost is NP-hard, as the problem generalizes Steiner Orientation. To address this hardness barrier, we design a suite of parameterized algorithms for minimizing crossing cost, with parameters including the number of arcs, edges, agents, and structural graph measures. These yield XP or FPT results depending on the parameter, offering algorithmic strategies for structurally restricted instances. Our framework provides a new theoretical foundation for decentralized multi-agent routing, bridging equilibrium analysis and parameterized complexity to support scalable and risk-aware coordination.

### 5. [Toward a Sustainable Federated Learning Ecosystem: A Practical Least Core Mechanism for Payoff Allocation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03387v1)

Authors: Zhengwei Ni, Zhidu Li, Wei Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Zehua Wang, F. Richard Yu, Victor C. M. Leung

Emerging network paradigms and applications increasingly rely on federated learning (FL) to enable collaborative intelligence while preserving privacy. However, the sustainability of such collaborative environments hinges on a fair and stable payoff allocation mechanism. Focusing on coalition stability, this paper introduces a payoff allocation framework based on the least core (LC) concept. Unlike traditional methods, the LC prioritizes the cohesion of the federation by minimizing the maximum dissatisfaction among all potential subgroups, ensuring that no participant has an incentive to break away. To adapt this game-theoretic concept to practical, large-scale networks, we propose a streamlined implementation with a stack-based pruning algorithm, effectively balancing computational efficiency with allocation precision. Case studies in federated intrusion detection demonstrate that our mechanism correctly identifies pivotal contributors and strategic alliances. The results confirm that the practical LC framework promotes stable collaboration and fosters a sustainable FL ecosystem.

Authors: Ya-Ting Yang, Quanyan Zhu

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of agentic AI systems that reason, plan, and act by invoking external tools. However, most existing agentic architectures remain centralized and monolithic, limiting scalability, specialization, and interoperability. This paper proposes a framework for scalable agentic intelligence, termed the Internet of Agentic AI, in which autonomous, heterogeneous agents distributed across cloud and edge infrastructure dynamically form coalitions to execute task-driven workflows. We formalize a network-native model of agentic collaboration and introduce an incentive-compatible workflow-coalition feasibility framework that integrates capability coverage, network locality, and economic implementability. To enable scalable coordination, we formulate a minimum-effort coalition selection problem and propose a decentralized coalition formation algorithm. The proposed framework can operate as a coordination layer above the Model Context Protocol (MCP). A healthcare case study demonstrates how domain specialization, cloud-edge heterogeneity, and dynamic coalition formation enable scalable, resilient, and economically viable agentic workflows. This work lays the foundation for principled coordination and scalability in the emerging era of Internet of Agentic AI.

### 7. [When Should Agents Coordinate in Differentiable Sequential Decision Problems?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03674v1)

Authors: Caleb Probine, Su Ann Low, David Fridovich-Keil, Ufuk Topcu

Multi-robot teams must coordinate to operate effectively. When a team operates in an uncoordinated manner, and agents choose actions that are only individually optimal, the team's outcome can suffer. However, in many domains, coordination requires costly communication. We explore the value of coordination in a broad class of differentiable motion-planning problems. In particular, we model coordinated behavior as a spectrum: at one extreme, agents jointly optimize a common team objective, and at the other, agents make unilaterally optimal decisions given their individual decision variables, i.e., they operate at Nash equilibria. We then demonstrate that reasoning about coordination in differentiable motion-planning problems reduces to reasoning about the second-order properties of agents' objectives, and we provide algorithms that use this second-order reasoning to determine at which times a team of agents should coordinate.

Authors: Matthew P. Lad, Louisa Conwill, Megan Levis Scheirer

With the rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs), criticism of their societal impact has also grown. Work in Responsible AI (RAI) has focused on the development of AI systems aimed at reducing harm. Responding to RAI's criticisms and the need to bring the wisdom traditions into HCI, we apply Conwill et al.'s Virtue-Guided Technology Design method to LLMs. We cataloged new ethical design patterns for LLMs and evaluated them through interviews with technologists. Participants valued that the patterns provided more accuracy and robustness, better safety, new research opportunities, increased access and control, and reduced waste. Their concerns were that the patterns could be vulnerable to jailbreaking, were generalizing models too widely, and had potential implementation issues. Overall, participants reacted positively while also acknowledging the tradeoffs involved in ethical LLM design.

Authors: Michael Küttner, Valeria Zitz, Supraja Ramesh, Michael Beigl, Tobias Röddiger

Respiratory rate (RR) is a key vital sign for clinical assessment and mental well-being, yet it is rarely monitored in everyday life due to the lack of unobtrusive sensing technologies. In-ear audio sensing is promising due to its high social acceptance and the amplification of physiological sounds caused by the occlusion effect; however, existing approaches often fail under real-world noise or rely on computationally expensive models. We present EarResp-ANS, the first system enabling fully on-device, real-time RR estimation on commercial earphones. The system employs LMS-based adaptive noise suppression (ANS) to attenuate ambient noise while preserving respiration-related acoustic components, without requiring neural networks or audio streaming, thereby explicitly addressing the energy and privacy constraints of wearable devices. We evaluate EarResp-ANS in a study with 18 participants under realistic acoustic conditions, including music, cafeteria noise, and white noise up to 80 dB SPL. EarResp-ANS achieves robust performance with a global MAE of 0.84 CPM , reduced to 0.47 CPM via automatic outlier rejection, while operating with less than 2% processor load directly on the earphone.

Authors: Nicolás E. Díaz Ferreyra, Moritz Mock, Max Kretschmann, Barbara Russo, Mojtaba Shahin, Mansooreh Zahedi, Riccardo Scandariato

Static Analysis Tools (SATs) are central to security engineering activities, as they enable early identification of code weaknesses without requiring execution. However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that such SATD-encoded information can be a meaningful complement to SAT-driven security analysis, while helping to overcome some of SATs' practical shortcomings.

### 5. [DiscoverLLM: From Executing Intents to Discovering Them](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03429v1)

Authors: Tae Soo Kim, Yoonjoo Lee, Jaesang Yu, John Joon Young Chung, Juho Kim

To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking "what kind of tone do you want?" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.

Authors: Yufeng Wu, Qing Li, Elise van den Hoven, Baki Kocaballi

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly integrated into photo applications on personal devices, making editing photographs easier than ever while potentially influencing the memories they represent. This study explores how and why people use GenAI to edit personal photos and how this shapes their remembering experience. We conducted a two-phase qualitative study with 12 participants: a photo editing session using a GenAI tool guided by the Remembering Experience (RX) dimensions, followed by semi-structured interviews where participants reflected on the editing process and results. Findings show that participants prioritised felt memory over factual accuracy. For different photo elements, environments were modified easily, however, editing was deemed unacceptable if it touched upon a person's identity. Editing processes brought positive and negative impacts, and itself also became a remembering experience. We further discuss potential benefits and risks of GenAI editing for remembering purposes and propose design implications for responsible GenAI.

Authors: Alexander Loth, Dominique Conceicao Rosario, Peter Ebinger, Martin Kappes, Marc-Oliver Pahl

The proliferation of generative AI poses challenges for information integrity assurance, requiring systems that connect model governance with end-user verification. We present Origin Lens, a privacy-first mobile framework that targets visual disinformation through a layered verification architecture. Unlike server-side detection systems, Origin Lens performs cryptographic image provenance verification and AI detection locally on the device via a Rust/Flutter hybrid architecture. Our system integrates multiple signals - including cryptographic provenance, generative model fingerprints, and optional retrieval-augmented verification - to provide users with graded confidence indicators at the point of consumption. We discuss the framework's alignment with regulatory requirements (EU AI Act, DSA) and its role in verification infrastructure that complements platform-level mechanisms.

Authors: Erzhen Hu, Frederik Brudy, David Ledo, George Fitzmaurice, Fraser Anderson

In pre-production, filmmakers and 3D animation experts must rapidly prototype ideas to explore a film's possibilities before fullscale production, yet conventional approaches involve trade-offs in efficiency and expressiveness. Hand-drawn storyboards often lack spatial precision needed for complex cinematography, while 3D previsualization demands expertise and high-quality rigged assets. To address this gap, we present PrevizWhiz, a system that leverages rough 3D scenes in combination with generative image and video models to create stylized video previews. The workflow integrates frame-level image restyling with adjustable resemblance, time-based editing through motion paths or external video inputs, and refinement into high-fidelity video clips. A study with filmmakers demonstrates that our system lowers technical barriers for film-makers, accelerates creative iteration, and effectively bridges the communication gap, while also surfacing challenges of continuity, authorship, and ethical consideration in AI-assisted filmmaking.

### 9. [Occlusion-Free Conformal Lensing for Spatiotemporal Visualization in 3D Urban Analytics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03743v1)

Authors: Roberta Mota, Julio D. Silva, Fabio Miranda, Usman Alim, Ehud Sharlin, Nivan Ferreira

The visualization of temporal data on urban buildings, such as shadows, noise, and solar potential, plays a critical role in the analysis of dynamic urban phenomena. However, in dense and geographically constrained 3D urban environments, visual representations of time-varying building data often suffer from occlusion and visual clutter. To address these two challenges, we introduce an immersive lens visualization that integrates a view-dependent cutaway de-occlusion technique and a temporal display derived from a conformal mapping algorithm. The mapping process first partitions irregular building footprints into smaller, sufficiently regular subregions that serve as structural primitives. These subregions are then seamlessly recombined to form a conformal, layered layout for our temporal lens visualization. The view-responsive cutaway is inspired by traditional architectural illustrations, preserving the overall layout of the building and its surroundings to maintain users' sense of spatial orientation. This lens design enables the occlusion-free embedding of shape-adaptive temporal displays across building facades on demand, supporting rapid time-space association for the discovery, access and interpretation of spatiotemporal urban patterns. Guided by domain and design goals, we outline the rationale behind the lens visual and interaction design choices, such as the encoding of time progression and temporal values in the conforming lens image. A user study compares our approach against conventional juxtaposition and x-ray spatiotemporal designs. Results validate the usage and utility of our lens, showing that it improves task accuracy and completion time, reduces navigation effort, and increases user confidence. From these findings, we distill design recommendations and promising directions for future research on spatially-embedded lenses in 3D visualization and urban analytics.

### 10. [Exploring the Role of Tracing in AI-Supported Planning for Algorithmic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03197v1)

Authors: Yoshee Jain, Heejin Do, Zihan Wu, April Yi Wang

AI-powered planning tools show promise in supporting programming learners by enabling early, formative feedback on their thinking processes prior to coding. To date, however, most AI-supported planning tools rely on students' natural-language explanations, using LLMs to interpret learners' descriptions of their algorithmic intent. Prior to the emergence of LLM-based systems, CS education research extensively studied trace-based planning in pen-and-paper settings, demonstrating that reasoning through stepwise execution with explicit state transitions helps learners build and refine mental models of program behavior. Despite its potential, little is known about how tracing interacts with AI-mediated feedback and whether integrating tracing into AI-supported planning tools leads to different learning processes or interaction dynamics compared to natural-language-based planning alone. We study how requiring learners to produce explicit execution traces with an AI-supported planning tool affects their algorithmic reasoning. In a between-subjects study with 20 students, tracing shifted learners away from code-like, line-by-line descriptions toward more goal-driven reasoning about program behavior. Moreover, it led to more consistent partially correct solutions, although final coding performance remained comparable across conditions. Notably, tracing did not significantly affect the quality or reliability of LLM-generated feedback. These findings reveal tradeoffs in combining tracing with AI-supported planning and inform design guidelines for integrating natural language, tracing, and coding to support iterative reasoning throughout the programming process.

### Information Retrieval

### 1. [Beyond Exposure: Optimizing Ranking Fairness with Non-linear Time-Income Functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03345v1)

Authors: Xuancheng Li, Tao Yang, Yujia Zhou, Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu

Ranking is central to information distribution in web search and recommendation. Nowadays, in ranking optimization, the fairness to item providers is viewed as a crucial factor alongside ranking relevance for users. There are currently numerous concepts of fairness and one widely recognized fairness concept is Exposure Fairness. However, it relies primarily on exposure determined solely by position, overlooking other factors that significantly influence income, such as time. To address this limitation, we propose to study ranking fairness when the provider utility is influenced by other contextual factors and is neither equal to nor proportional to item exposure. We give a formal definition of Income Fairness and develop a corresponding measurement metric. Simulated experiments show that existing-exposure-fairness-based ranking algorithms fail to optimize the proposed income fairness. Therefore, we propose the Dynamic-Income-Derivative-aware Ranking Fairness algorithm, which, based on the marginal income gain at the present timestep, uses Taylor-expansion-based gradients to simultaneously optimize effectiveness and income fairness. In both offline and online settings with diverse time-income functions, DIDRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Authors: Süha Kağan Köse, Mehmet Can Baytekin, Burak Aktaş, Bilge Kaan Görür, Evren Ayberk Munis, Deniz Yılmaz, Muhammed Yusuf Kartal, Çağrı Toraman

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM factuality, yet design guidance remains English-centric, limiting insights for morphologically rich languages like Turkish. We address this by constructing a comprehensive Turkish RAG dataset derived from Turkish Wikipedia and CulturaX, comprising question-answer pairs and relevant passage chunks. We benchmark seven stages of the RAG pipeline, from query transformation and reranking to answer refinement, without task-specific fine-tuning. Our results show that complex methods like HyDE maximize accuracy (85%) that is considerably higher than the baseline (78.70%). Also a Pareto-optimal configuration using Cross-encoder Reranking and Context Augmentation achieves comparable performance (84.60%) with much lower cost. We further demonstrate that over-stacking generative modules can degrade performance by distorting morphological cues, whereas simple query clarification with robust reranking offers an effective solution.

### 3. [Distribution-Aware End-to-End Embedding for Streaming Numerical Features in Click-Through Rate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03223v1)

Authors: Jiahao Liu, Hongji Ruan, Weimin Zhang, Ziye Tong, Derick Tang, Zhanpeng Zeng, Qinsong Zeng, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu

This paper explores effective numerical feature embedding for Click-Through Rate prediction in streaming environments. Conventional static binning methods rely on offline statistics of numerical distributions; however, this inherently two-stage process often triggers semantic drift during bin boundary updates. While neural embedding methods enable end-to-end learning, they often discard explicit distributional information. Integrating such information end-to-end is challenging because streaming features often violate the i.i.d. assumption, precluding unbiased estimation of the population distribution via the expectation of order statistics. Furthermore, the critical context dependency of numerical distributions is often neglected. To this end, we propose DAES, an end-to-end framework designed to tackle numerical feature embedding in streaming training scenarios by integrating distributional information with an adaptive modulation mechanism. Specifically, we introduce an efficient reservoir-sampling-based distribution estimation method and two field-aware distribution modulation strategies to capture streaming distributions and field-dependent semantics. DAES significantly outperforms existing approaches as demonstrated by extensive offline and online experiments and has been fully deployed on a leading short-video platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users.

### 4. [PAMAS: Self-Adaptive Multi-Agent System with Perspective Aggregation for Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03158v1)

Authors: Zongwei Wang, Min Gao, Junliang Yu, Tong Chen, Chenghua Lin

Misinformation on social media poses a critical threat to information credibility, as its diverse and context-dependent nature complicates detection. Large language model-empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) present a promising paradigm that enables cooperative reasoning and collective intelligence to combat this threat. However, conventional MAS suffer from an information-drowning problem, where abundant truthful content overwhelms sparse and weak deceptive cues. With full input access, agents tend to focus on dominant patterns, and inter-agent communication further amplifies this bias. To tackle this issue, we propose PAMAS, a multi-agent framework with perspective aggregation, which employs hierarchical, perspective-aware aggregation to highlight anomaly cues and alleviate information drowning. PAMAS organizes agents into three roles: Auditors, Coordinators, and a Decision-Maker. Auditors capture anomaly cues from specialized feature subsets; Coordinators aggregate their perspectives to enhance coverage while maintaining diversity; and the Decision-Maker, equipped with evolving memory and full contextual access, synthesizes all subordinate insights to produce the final judgment. Furthermore, to improve efficiency in multi-agent collaboration, PAMAS incorporates self-adaptive mechanisms for dynamic topology optimization and routing-based inference, enhancing both efficiency and scalability. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PAMAS achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable and trustworthy way for misinformation detection.

### 5. [From Speech-to-Spatial: Grounding Utterances on A Live Shared View with Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03059v1)

Authors: Yoonsang Kim, Divyansh Pradhan, Devshree Jadeja, Arie Kaufman

We introduce Speech-to-Spatial, a referent disambiguation framework that converts verbal remote-assistance instructions into spatially grounded AR guidance. Unlike prior systems that rely on additional cues (e.g., gesture, gaze) or manual expert annotations, Speech-to-Spatial infers the intended target solely from spoken references (speech input). Motivated by our formative study of speech referencing patterns, we characterize recurring ways people specify targets (Direct Attribute, Relational, Remembrance, and Chained) and ground them to our object-centric relational graph. Given an utterance, referent cues are parsed and rendered as persistent in-situ AR visual guidance, reducing iterative micro-guidance ("a bit more to the right", "now, stop.") during remote guidance. We demonstrate the use cases of our system with remote guided assistance and intent disambiguation scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Speechto-Spatial improves task efficiency, reduces cognitive load, and enhances usability compared to a conventional voice-only baseline, transforming disembodied verbal instruction into visually explainable, actionable guidance on a live shared view.

### 6. [Ontology-to-tools compilation for executable semantic constraint enforcement in LLM agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03439v1)

Authors: Xiaochi Zhou, Patrick Bulter, Changxuan Yang, Simon D. Rihm, Thitikarn Angkanaporn, Jethro Akroyd, Sebastian Mosbach, Markus Kraft

We introduce ontology-to-tools compilation as a proof-of-principle mechanism for coupling large language models (LLMs) with formal domain knowledge. Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems.

### 7. [Failure is Feedback: History-Aware Backtracking for Agentic Traversal in Multimodal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03432v1)

Authors: Joohyung Yun, Doyup Lee, Wook-Shin Han

Open-domain multimodal document retrieval aims to retrieve specific components (paragraphs, tables, or images) from large and interconnected document corpora. Existing graph-based retrieval approaches typically rely on a uniform similarity metric that overlooks hop-specific semantics, and their rigid pre-defined plans hinder dynamic error correction. These limitations suggest that a retriever should adapt its reasoning to the evolving context and recover intelligently from dead ends. To address these needs, we propose Failure is Feedback (FiF), which casts subgraph retrieval as a sequential decision process and introduces two key innovations. (i) We introduce a history-aware backtracking mechanism; unlike standard backtracking that simply reverts the state, our approach piggybacks on the context of failed traversals, leveraging insights from previous failures. (ii) We implement an economically-rational agentic workflow. Unlike conventional agents with static strategies, our orchestrator employs a cost-aware traversal method to dynamically manage the trade-off between retrieval accuracy and inference costs, escalating to intensive LLM-based reasoning only when the prior failure justifies the additional computational investment. Extensive experiments show that FiF achieves state-of-the-art retrieval on the benchmarks of MultimodalQA, MMCoQA and WebQA.

### 8. [ALPBench: A Benchmark for Attribution-level Long-term Personal Behavior Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03056v1)

Recent advances in large language models have highlighted their potential for personalized recommendation, where accurately capturing user preferences remains a key challenge. Leveraging their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs offer new opportunities for modeling long-term user behavior. To systematically evaluate this, we introduce ALPBench, a Benchmark for Attribution-level Long-term Personal Behavior Understanding. Unlike item-focused benchmarks, ALPBench predicts user-interested attribute combinations, enabling ground-truth evaluation even for newly introduced items. It models preferences from long-term historical behaviors rather than users' explicitly expressed requests, better reflecting enduring interests. User histories are represented as natural language sequences, allowing interpretable, reasoning-based personalization. ALPBench enables fine-grained evaluation of personalization by focusing on the prediction of attribute combinations task that remains highly challenging for current LLMs due to the need to capture complex interactions among multiple attributes and reason over long-term user behavior sequences.

### 9. [Tutorial on Reasoning for IR & IR for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03640v1)

Authors: Mohanna Hoveyda, Panagiotis Efstratiadis, Arjen de Vries, Maarten de Rijke

Information retrieval has long focused on ranking documents by semantic relatedness. Yet many real-world information needs demand more: enforcement of logical constraints, multi-step inference, and synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. Addressing these requirements is, at its core, a problem of reasoning. Across AI communities, researchers are developing diverse solutions for the problem of reasoning, from inference-time strategies and post-training of LLMs, to neuro-symbolic systems, Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks, geometric representations, and energy-based models. These efforts target the same problem: to move beyond pattern-matching systems toward structured, verifiable inference. However, they remain scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for IR researchers to identify the most relevant ideas and opportunities. To help navigate the fragmented landscape of research in reasoning, this tutorial first articulates a working definition of reasoning within the context of information retrieval and derives from it a unified analytical framework. The framework maps existing approaches along axes that reflect the core components of the definition. By providing a comprehensive overview of recent approaches and mapping current methods onto the defined axes, we expose their trade-offs and complementarities, highlight where IR can benefit from cross-disciplinary advances, and illustrate how retrieval process itself can play a central role in broader reasoning systems. The tutorial will equip participants with both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for enhancing reasoning-capable IR systems, while situating IR as a domain that both benefits and contributes to the broader development of reasoning methodologies.

### 10. [SCASRec: A Self-Correcting and Auto-Stopping Model for Generative Route List Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03324v1)

Authors: Chao Chen, Longfei Xu, Daohan Su, Tengfei Liu, Hanyu Guo, Yihai Duan, Kaikui Liu, Xiangxiang Chu

Route recommendation systems commonly adopt a multi-stage pipeline involving fine-ranking and re-ranking to produce high-quality ordered recommendations. However, this paradigm faces three critical limitations. First, there is a misalignment between offline training objectives and online metrics. Offline gains do not necessarily translate to online improvements. Actual performance must be validated through A/B testing, which may potentially compromise the user experience. Second, redundancy elimination relies on rigid, handcrafted rules that lack adaptability to the high variance in user intent and the unstructured complexity of real-world scenarios. Third, the strict separation between fine-ranking and re-ranking stages leads to sub-optimal performance. Since each module is optimized in isolation, the fine-ranking stage remains oblivious to the list-level objectives (e.g., diversity) targeted by the re-ranker, thereby preventing the system from achieving a jointly optimized global optimum. To overcome these intertwined challenges, we propose \textbf{SCASRec} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{C}orrecting and \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{S}topping \textbf{Rec}ommendation), a unified generative framework that integrates ranking and redundancy elimination into a single end-to-end process. SCASRec introduces a stepwise corrective reward (SCR) to guide list-wise refinement by focusing on hard samples, and employs a learnable End-of-Recommendation (EOR) token to terminate generation adaptively when no further improvement is expected. Experiments on two large-scale, open-sourced route recommendation datasets demonstrate that SCASRec establishes an SOTA in offline and online settings. SCASRec has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Machine Learning

### 1. [Merging Beyond: Streaming LLM Updates via Activation-Guided Rotations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03237v1)

Authors: Yuxuan Yao, Haonan Sheng, Qingsong Lv, Han Wu, Shuqi Liu, Zehua Liu, Zengyan Liu, Jiahui Gao, Haochen Tan, Xiaojin Fu, Haoli Bai, Hing Cheung So, Zhijiang Guo, Linqi Song

The escalating scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient adaptation techniques. Model merging has gained prominence for its efficiency and controllability. However, existing merging techniques typically serve as post-hoc refinements or focus on mitigating task interference, often failing to capture the dynamic optimization benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose Streaming Merging, an innovative model updating paradigm that conceptualizes merging as an iterative optimization process. Central to this paradigm is \textbf{ARM} (\textbf{A}ctivation-guided \textbf{R}otation-aware \textbf{M}erging), a strategy designed to approximate gradient descent dynamics. By treating merging coefficients as learning rates and deriving rotation vectors from activation subspaces, ARM effectively steers parameter updates along data-driven trajectories. Unlike conventional linear interpolation, ARM aligns semantic subspaces to preserve the geometric structure of high-dimensional parameter evolution. Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (e.g., math, code) demonstrate that ARM can transcend converged checkpoints. Extensive experiments show that ARM provides a scalable and lightweight framework for efficient model adaptation.

### 2. [Probe-then-Commit Multi-Objective Bandits: Theoretical Benefits of Limited Multi-Arm Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03175v1)

Authors: Ming Shi

We study an online resource-selection problem motivated by multi-radio access selection and mobile edge computing offloading. In each round, an agent chooses among $K$ candidate links/servers (arms) whose performance is a stochastic $d$-dimensional vector (e.g., throughput, latency, energy, reliability). The key interaction is \emph{probe-then-commit (PtC)}: the agent may probe up to $q>1$ candidates via control-plane measurements to observe their vector outcomes, but must execute exactly one candidate in the data plane. This limited multi-arm feedback regime strictly interpolates between classical bandits ($q=1$) and full-information experts ($q=K$), yet existing multi-objective learning theory largely focuses on these extremes. We develop \textsc{PtC-P-UCB}, an optimistic probe-then-commit algorithm whose technical core is frontier-aware probing under uncertainty in a Pareto mode, e.g., it selects the $q$ probes by approximately maximizing a hypervolume-inspired frontier-coverage potential and commits by marginal hypervolume gain to directly expand the attained Pareto region. We prove a dominated-hypervolume frontier error of $\tilde{O} (K_P d/\sqrt{qT})$, where $K_P$ is the Pareto-frontier size and $T$ is the horizon, and scalarized regret $\tilde{O} (L_φd\sqrt{(K/q)T})$, where $φ$ is the scalarizer. These quantify a transparent $1/\sqrt{q}$ acceleration from limited probing. We further extend to \emph{multi-modal probing}: each probe returns $M$ modalities (e.g., CSI, queue, compute telemetry), and uncertainty fusion yields variance-adaptive versions of the above bounds via an effective noise scale.

### 3. [Fully Kolmogorov-Arnold Deep Model in Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03156v1)

Authors: Xingyu Qiu, Xinghua Ma, Dong Liang, Gongning Luo, Wei Wang, Kuanquan Wang, Shuo Li

Deeply stacked KANs are practically impossible due to high training difficulties and substantial memory requirements. Consequently, existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the comprehensive exploration of KANs. This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to directly deeply stacked KAN, ALL U-KAN achieves 10 times reduction in parameter count and reduces memory consumption by more than 20 times, unlocking the new explorations into deep KAN architectures.

### 4. [Clarify Before You Draw: Proactive Agents for Robust Text-to-CAD Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03045v1)

Authors: Bo Yuan, Zelin Zhao, Petr Molodyk, Bin Hu, Yongxin Chen

Large language models have recently enabled text-to-CAD systems that synthesize parametric CAD programs (e.g., CadQuery) from natural language prompts. In practice, however, geometric descriptions can be under-specified or internally inconsistent: critical dimensions may be missing and constraints may conflict. Existing fine-tuned models tend to reactively follow user instructions and hallucinate dimensions when the text is ambiguous. To address this, we propose a proactive agentic framework for text-to-CadQuery generation, named ProCAD, that resolves specification issues before code synthesis. Our framework pairs a proactive clarifying agent, which audits the prompt and asks targeted clarification questions only when necessary to produce a self-consistent specification, with a CAD coding agent that translates the specification into an executable CadQuery program. We fine-tune the coding agent on a curated high-quality text-to-CadQuery dataset and train the clarifying agent via agentic SFT on clarification trajectories. Experiments show that proactive clarification significantly improves robustness to ambiguous prompts while keeping interaction overhead low. ProCAD outperforms frontier closed-source models, including Claude Sonnet 4.5, reducing the mean Chamfer distance by 79.9 percent and lowering the invalidity ratio from 4.8 percent to 0.9 percent. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available.

### 5. [LatentMem: Customizing Latent Memory for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03036v1)

Authors: Muxin Fu, Guibin Zhang, Xiangyuan Xue, Yafu Li, Zefeng He, Siyuan Huang, Xiaoye Qu, Yu Cheng, Yang Yang

Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable collective intelligence, wherein multi-agent memory serves as a pivotal mechanism for continual adaptation. However, existing multi-agent memory designs remain constrained by two fundamental bottlenecks: (i) memory homogenization arising from the absence of role-aware customization, and (ii) information overload induced by excessively fine-grained memory entries. To address these limitations, we propose LatentMem, a learnable multi-agent memory framework designed to customize agent-specific memories in a token-efficient manner. Specifically, LatentMem comprises an experience bank that stores raw interaction trajectories in a lightweight form, and a memory composer that synthesizes compact latent memories conditioned on retrieved experience and agent-specific contexts. Further, we introduce Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), which propagates task-level optimization signals through latent memories to the composer, encouraging it to produce compact and high-utility representations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and mainstream MAS frameworks show that LatentMem achieves a performance gain of up to $19.36$% over vanilla settings and consistently outperforms existing memory architectures, without requiring any modifications to the underlying frameworks.

### 6. [Consistency Deep Equilibrium Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03024v1)

Authors: Junchao Lin, Zenan Ling, Jingwen Xu, Robert C. Qiu

Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning, offering the ability to model infinite-depth networks with constant memory usage. However, DEQs incur significant inference latency due to the iterative nature of fixed-point solvers. In this work, we introduce the Consistency Deep Equilibrium Model (C-DEQ), a novel framework that leverages consistency distillation to accelerate DEQ inference. We cast the DEQ iterative inference process as evolution along a fixed ODE trajectory toward the equilibrium. Along this trajectory, we train C-DEQs to consistently map intermediate states directly to the fixed point, enabling few-step inference while preserving the performance of the teacher DEQ. At the same time, it facilitates multi-step evaluation to flexibly trade computation for performance gains. Extensive experiments across various domain tasks demonstrate that C-DEQs achieves consistent 2-20$\times$ accuracy improvements over implicit DEQs under the same few-step inference budget.

### 7. [Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder for Reliable and Interpretable Process Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03004v1)

Authors: Xiangrui Zhang, Chunyue Song, Wei Dai, Zheng Zhang, Kaihua Gao, Furong Gao

To improve the reliability and interpretability of industrial process monitoring, this article proposes a Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder (CGSTAE). The network architecture of CGSTAE combines two components: a correlation graph structure learning module based on spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder module utilizing graph convolutional long-short term memory (GCLSTM). The SSAM learns correlation graphs by capturing dynamic relationships between variables, while a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is introduced to derive a causal graph from these correlation graphs. The algorithm leverages a reverse perspective of causal invariance principle to uncover the invariant causal graph from varying correlations. The spatial-temporal encoder-decoder, built with GCLSTM units, reconstructs time-series process data within a sequence-to-sequence framework. The proposed CGSTAE enables effective process monitoring and fault detection through two statistics in the feature space and residual space. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of CGSTAE in process monitoring through the Tennessee Eastman process and a real-world air separation process.

### 8. [NLI:Non-uniform Linear Interpolation Approximation of Nonlinear Operations for Efficient LLMs Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02988v1)

Authors: Jiangyong Yu, Xiaomeng Han, Xing Hu, Chen Xu, Zhe Jiang, Dawei Yang

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, but their deployment is often constrained by substantial memory footprints and computational costs. While prior work has achieved significant progress in compressing and accelerating linear layers, nonlinear layers-such as SiLU, RMSNorm, and Softmax-still heavily depend on high-precision floating-point operations. In this paper, we propose a calibration-free, dynamic-programming-optimal, and hardware-friendly framework called Non-uniform Linear Interpolation (NLI). NLI is capable of efficiently approximating a variety of nonlinear functions, enabling seamless integration into LLMs and other deep neural networks with almost no loss in accuracy. NLI ingeniously recasts cutpoint selection as a dynamic-programming problem, achieving the globally minimal interpolation error in O(MxN2) time via Bellman's optimality principle. Based on the NLI algorithm, we also design and implement a plug-and-play universal nonlinear computation unit. Hardware experiments demonstrate that the NLI Engine achieves more than 4x improvement in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art designs.

### 9. [Where Norms and References Collide: Evaluating LLMs on Normative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02975v1)

Authors: Mitchell Abrams, Kaveh Eskandari Miandoab, Felix Gervits, Vasanth Sarathy, Matthias Scheutz

Embodied agents, such as robots, will need to interact in situated environments where successful communication often depends on reasoning over social norms: shared expectations that constrain what actions are appropriate in context. A key capability in such settings is norm-based reference resolution (NBRR), where interpreting referential expressions requires inferring implicit normative expectations grounded in physical and social context. Yet it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support this kind of reasoning. In this work, we introduce SNIC (Situated Norms in Context), a human-validated diagnostic testbed designed to probe how well state-of-the-art LLMs can extract and utilize normative principles relevant to NBRR. SNIC emphasizes physically grounded norms that arise in everyday tasks such as cleaning, tidying, and serving. Across a range of controlled evaluations, we find that even the strongest LLMs struggle to consistently identify and apply social norms, particularly when norms are implicit, underspecified, or in conflict. These findings reveal a blind spot in current LLMs and highlight a key challenge for deploying language-based systems in socially situated, embodied settings.

### 10. [3D-Learning: Diffusion-Augmented Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02943v1)

Authors: Jiaqi Wen, Lei Fan, Jianyi Yang

Predict-then-Optimize (PTO) pipelines are widely employed in computing and networked systems, where Machine Learning (ML) models are used to predict critical contextual information for downstream decision-making tasks such as cloud LLM serving, data center demand response, and edge workload scheduling. However, these ML predictors are often vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples at test time, leading to significant decision performance degradation due to large prediction errors. To address the generalization challenges under OOD conditions, we present the framework of Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (DR-DFL), which trains ML models to optimize decision performance under the worst-case distribution. Instead of relying on classical Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) techniques, we propose Diffusion-Augmented Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (3D-Learning), which searches for the worst-case distribution within the parameterized space of a diffusion model. By leveraging the powerful distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models, 3D-Learning identifies worst-case distributions that remain consistent with real data, achieving a favorable balance between average and worst-case scenarios. Empirical results on an LLM resource provisioning task demonstrate that 3D-Learning outperforms existing DRO and Data Augmentation methods in OOD generalization performance.

### 1. [Investigating Quantum Circuit Designs Using Neuro-Evolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03840v1)

Authors: Devroop Kar, Daniel Krutz, Travis Desell

Designing effective quantum circuits remains a central challenge in quantum computing, as circuit structure strongly influences expressivity, trainability, and hardware feasibility. Current approaches, whether using manually designed circuit templates, fixed heuristics, or automated rules, face limitations in scalability, flexibility, and adaptability, often producing circuits that are poorly matched to the specific problem or quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Quantum Circuits (EXAQC), an evolutionary approach to the automated design and training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) which leverages and extends on strategies from neuroevolution and genetic programming. The proposed method jointly searches over gate types, qubit connectivity, parameterization, and circuit depth while respecting hardware and noise constraints. The method supports both Qiskit and Pennylane libraries, allowing the user to configure every aspect. This work highlights evolutionary search as a critical tool for advancing quantum machine learning and variational quantum algorithms, providing a principled pathway toward scalable, problem-aware, and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design. Preliminary results demonstrate that circuits evolved on classification tasks are able to achieve over 90% accuracy on most of the benchmark datasets with a limited computational budget, and are able to emulate target circuit quantum states with high fidelity scores.

Authors: Nicholas M. Blauch, George A. Alvarez, Talia Konkle

Human vision is foveated, with variable resolution peaking at the center of a large field of view; this reflects an efficient trade-off for active sensing, allowing eye-movements to bring different parts of the world into focus with other parts of the world in context. In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision.

Authors: Asif Tauhid, Sidahmed Benabderrahmane, Mohamad Altrabulsi, Ahamed Foisal, Talal Rahwan

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks that are difficult to detect because they operate stealthily and often blend into normal system behavior. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities in system-level provenance data. Our approach first constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors based on feature similarity, then learns normal relational structure using a Graph Autoencoder. Anomaly candidates are identified through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. To further improve detection, we integrate an rare pattern mining module that discovers infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and uses them to boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures. We evaluate the proposed method on the DARPA Transparent Computing datasets and show that rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over the baseline GAE. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches on the same benchmark, our single unified model consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors. These results highlight the value of coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining to improve both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection.

### 4. [Contrastive Concept-Tree Search for LLM-Assisted Algorithm Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03132v1)

Authors: Timothee Leleu, Sudeera Gunathilaka, Federico Ghimenti, Surya Ganguli

Large language Model (LLM)-assisted algorithm discovery is an iterative, black-box optimization process over programs to approximatively solve a target task, where an LLM proposes candidate programs and an external evaluator provides task feedback. Despite intense recent research on the topic and promising results, how can the LLM internal representation of the space of possible programs be maximally exploited to improve performance is an open question. Here, we introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which extracts a hierarchical concept representation from the generated programs and learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection. By reweighting parents using a likelihood-ratio score between high- and low-performing solutions, CCTS biases search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones, providing guidance through an explicit concept hierarchy rather than the algorithm lineage constructed by the LLM. We show that CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across a benchmark of open Erdős-type combinatorics problems. Our analysis indicates that the gains are driven largely by learning which concepts to avoid. We further validate these findings in a controlled synthetic algorithm-discovery environment, which reproduces qualitatively the search dynamics observed with the LLMs.

### 5. [Equilibrium Propagation for Non-Conservative Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03670v1)

Authors: Antonino Emanuele Scurria, Dimitri Vanden Abeele, Bortolo Matteo Mognetti, Serge Massar

Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a physics-inspired learning algorithm that uses stationary states of a dynamical system both for inference and learning. In its original formulation it is limited to conservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ to dynamics which derive from an energy function. Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals.

### 1. [Perfect Network Resilience in Polynomial Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03827v1)

Authors: Matthias Bentert, Stefan Schmid

Modern communication networks support local fast rerouting mechanisms to quickly react to link failures: nodes store a set of conditional rerouting rules which define how to forward an incoming packet in case of incident link failures. The rerouting decisions at any node $v$ must rely solely on local information available at $v$: the link from which a packet arrived at $v$, the target of the packet, and the incident link failures at $v$. Ideally, such rerouting mechanisms provide perfect resilience: any packet is routed from its source to its target as long as the two are connected in the underlying graph after the link failures. Already in their seminal paper at ACM PODC '12, Feigenbaum, Godfrey, Panda, Schapira, Shenker, and Singla showed that perfect resilience cannot always be achieved. While the design of local rerouting algorithms has received much attention since then, we still lack a detailed understanding of when perfect resilience is achievable.
  This paper closes this gap and presents a complete characterization of when perfect resilience can be achieved. This characterization also allows us to design an $O(n)$-time algorithm to decide whether a given instance is perfectly resilient and an $O(nm)$-time algorithm to compute perfectly resilient rerouting rules whenever it is. Our algorithm is also attractive for the simple structure of the rerouting rules it uses, known as skipping in the literature: alternative links are chosen according to an ordered priority list (per in-port), where failed links are simply skipped. Intriguingly, our result also implies that in the context of perfect resilience, skipping rerouting rules are as powerful as more general rerouting rules. This partially answers a long-standing open question by Chiesa, Nikolaevskiy, Mitrovic, Gurtov, Madry, Schapira, and Shenker [IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 2017] in the affirmative.

### 2. [Joint Network-and-Server Congestion in Multi-Source Traffic Allocation: A Convex Formulation and Price-Based Decentralization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03246v1)

Authors: Tamoghna Sarkar, Bhaskar Krishnamachari

This paper studies an important rate allocation problem that arises in many networked and distributed systems: steady-state traffic rate allocation from multiple sources to multiple service nodes when both (i) the access-path delay on each source-node route is rate-dependent (capacity-constrained) and convex, and (ii) each service node (also capacity-constrained) experiences a load-dependent queueing delay driven by aggregate load from all sources. We show that the resulting flow-weighted end-to-end delay minimization is a convex program, yielding a global system-optimal solution characterized by KKT conditions that equalize total marginal costs (a path marginal access term plus a node congestion price) across all utilized routes. This condition admits a Wardrop-type interpretation: for each source, all utilized options equalize total marginal cost, while any option with strictly larger total marginal cost receives no flow. Building on this structure, we develop a lightweight distributed pricing-based algorithm in which each service node locally computes and broadcasts a scalar congestion price from its observed aggregate load, while each source updates its traffic split by solving a small separable convex allocation problem under the advertised prices. Numerical illustrations demonstrate convergence of the distributed iteration to the centralized optimum and highlight the trade-offs induced by jointly modeling access and service congestion.

Authors: Inhar Yeregui, Ángel Martín, Mikel Zorrilla, Roberto Viola, Jasone Astorga, Eduardo Jacob

The rapid growth of multi-user eXtended Reality (XR) applications, spanning fields such as entertainment, education, and telemedicine, demands seamless, immersive experiences for users interacting within shared, distributed environments. Delivering such latency-sensitive experiences involves considerable challenges in orchestrating network, computing, and service resources, where existing limitations highlight the need for a structured approach to analyse and optimise these complex systems. This challenge is amplified by the need for high-performance, low-latency connectivity, where 5G and 6G networks provide essential infrastructure to meet the requirements of XR services at scale. This article addresses these challenges by developing a model that parametrises multi-user XR services across four critical layers of the standard virtualisation architecture. We formalise this model mathematically, proposing a context-aware framework that defines key parameters at each level and integrates them into a comprehensive Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration strategy. Our contributions include a detailed analysis of the current limitations and needs in existing Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration approaches, the formulation of a layered mathematical model, and a validation framework that demonstrates the utility and feasibility of the proposed solution.

Authors: Tianyi Gong, Zijian Cao, Zixing Zhang, Jiangkai Wu, Xinggong Zhang, Shuguang Cui, Fangxin Wang

Video streaming is a fundamental Internet service, while the quality still cannot be guaranteed especially in poor network conditions such as bandwidth-constrained and remote areas. Existing works mainly work towards two directions: traditional pixel-codec streaming nearly approaches its limit and is hard to step further in compression; the emerging neural-enhanced or generative streaming usually fall short in latency and visual fidelity, hindering their practical deployment. Inspired by the recent success of vision foundation model (VFM), we strive to harness the powerful video understanding and processing capacities of VFM to achieve generalization, high fidelity and loss resilience for real-time video streaming with even higher compression rate. We present the first revolutionized paradigm that enables VFM-based end-to-end generative video streaming towards this goal. Specifically, Morphe employs joint training of visual tokenizers and variable-resolution spatiotemporal optimization under simulated network constraints. Additionally, a robust streaming system is constructed that leverages intelligent packet dropping to resist real-world network perturbations. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that Morphe achieves comparable visual quality while saving 62.5\% bandwidth compared to H.265, and accomplishes real-time, loss-resilient video delivery in challenging network environments, representing a milestone in VFM-enabled multimedia streaming solutions.

Authors: Angelo Feraudo, Stefano Maxenti, Andrea Lacava, Leonardo Bonati, Paolo Bellavista, Michele Polese, Tommaso Melodia

Openness and programmability in the O-RAN architecture enable closed-loop control of the Radio Access Network (RAN). Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven xApps, in the near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), can learn from network data, anticipate future conditions, and dynamically adapt radio configurations. However, their development and adoption are hindered by the complexity of low-level RAN control and monitoring message models exposed over the O-RAN E2 interface, limited interoperability across heterogeneous RAN software stacks, and the lack of developer-friendly frameworks. In this paper, we introduce xDevSM, a framework that significantly lowers the barrier to xApp development by unifying observability and control in O-RAN deployment. By exposing a rich set of Key Performance Measurements (KPMs) and enabling fine-grained radio resource management controls, xDevSM provides the essential foundation for practical AI-driven xApps. We validate xDevSM on real-world testbeds, leveraging Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) devices together with heterogeneous RAN hardware, including Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)-based Software-defined Radios (SDRs) and Foxconn radio units, and show its seamless interoperability across multiple open-source RAN software stacks. Furthermore, we discuss and evaluate the capabilities of our framework through three O-RAN-based scenarios of high interest: (i) KPM-based monitoring of network performance, (ii) slice-level Physical Resource Block (PRB) allocation control across multiple User Equipments (UEs) and slices, and (iii) mobility-aware handover control, showing that xDevSM can implement intelligent closed-loop applications, laying the groundwork for learning-based optimization in heterogeneous RAN deployments. xDevSM is open source and available as foundational tool for the research community.

Authors: Hari Hara Sudhan Selvam, Sameer G. Kulkarni

Stateful Middleboxes are integral part of enterprise and campus networks that provide essential in-network, security, and value-added services. These stateful middleboxes rely on precise network flow identification. However, the adoption of HTTP/3, which uses the QUIC protocol, poses significant challenges to the proper functioning of these devices. QUIC's encryption and connection migration features obscure flow semantics, disrupting middlebox visibility and functionality. We examine how QUIC disrupts middleboxes like Network Address Translators (NATs), Rate Limiters, Load Balancers, etc., and affects Kubernetes-based service deployments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, generalized framework that enables stateful middleboxes to reliably track QUIC connections, even when the endpoints change their internet protocol (IP) address or port numbers. Our prototype implementation demonstrates that the proposed approach preserves middlebox functionality with HTTP/3 with negligible performance overhead (< 5%) on both throughput and latency, and works effectively even under high QUIC connection migration rates of up to 100 Hz.

### 7. [RIPPLE: Lifecycle-aware Embedding of Service Function Chains in Multi-access Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03662v1)

Authors: Federico Giarrè, Holger Karl

In Multi-access Edge Computing networks, services can be deployed on nearby edge clouds (EC) as service function chains (SFCs) to meet strict quality of service (QoS) requirements. As users move, frequent SFC reconfigurations are required, but these are non-trivial: SFCs can serve users only when all required virtual network functions (VNFs) are available, and VNFs undergo time-consuming lifecycle operations before becoming operational. We show that ignoring lifecycle dynamics oversimplifies deployment, jeopardizes QoS, and must be avoided in practical SFC management. To address this, forecasts of user connectivity can be leveraged to proactively deploy VNFs and reconfigure SFCs. But forecasts are inherently imperfect, requiring lifecycle and connectivity uncertainty to be jointly considered. We present RIPPLE, a lifecycle-aware SFC embedding approach to deploy VNFs at the right time and location, reducing service interruptions. We show that RIPPLE closes the gap with solutions that unrealistically assume instantaneous lifecycle, even under realistic lifecycle constraints.

Authors: Antonio Boiano, Dalin Zheng, Fabio Palmese, Andrea Pimpinella, Alessandro E. C. Redondi

Zigbee is widely used in smart home environments due to its low power consumption and support for mesh networking, making it a relevant target for traffic-based IoT forensic analysis. However, existing studies often rely on limited datasets and fixed network configurations. In this paper, we analyze Zigbee network traffic from three complementary perspectives: data collection, traffic classification, and storage efficiency. We introduce ZIOTP2025, a publicly available dataset of Zigbee traffic collected from commercial smart home devices deployed under multiple network configurations and capturing realistic interaction scenarios. Using this dataset, we study two traffic classification tasks: device type classification and individual device identification, and evaluate their robustness under both intra-configuration and cross-configuration settings. Our results show that while high classification accuracy can be achieved under controlled conditions, performance degrades significantly when models are evaluated across different network configurations, particularly for fine-grained identification tasks. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between traffic storage requirements and classification accuracy. We show that lossy compression of traffic features through quantization can reduce storage requirements by approximately 4-5x compared to lossless storage of raw packet traces, while preserving near-lossless classification performance. Overall, our results highlight the need for topology-aware Zigbee traffic analysis and storage-efficient feature compression to enable robust and scalable IoT forensic systems.

Authors: Marco Job, Thomas Stastny, Eleni Kelasidi, Roland Siegwart, Michael Pantic

Autonomous field robots operating in unstructured environments require robust perception to ensure safe and reliable operations. Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have demonstrated the potential of low-cost cameras as depth sensors; however, their adoption in field robotics remains limited due to the absence of reliable scale cues, ambiguous or low-texture conditions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a depth completion model that trains on synthetic data and uses extremely sparse measurements from depth sensors to predict dense metric depth in unseen field robotics environments. A synthetic dataset generation pipeline tailored to field robotics enables the creation of multiple realistic datasets for training purposes. This dataset generation approach utilizes textured 3D meshes from Structure from Motion and photorealistic rendering with novel viewpoint synthesis to simulate diverse field robotics scenarios. Our approach achieves an end-to-end latency of 53 ms per frame on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin, enabling real-time deployment on embedded platforms. Extensive evaluation demonstrates competitive performance across diverse real-world field robotics scenarios.

### 2. [PlanTRansformer: Unified Prediction and Planning with Goal-conditioned Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03376v1)

Authors: Constantin Selzer, Fabina B. Flohr

Trajectory prediction and planning are fundamental yet disconnected components in autonomous driving. Prediction models forecast surrounding agent motion under unknown intentions, producing multimodal distributions, while planning assumes known ego objectives and generates deterministic trajectories. This mismatch creates a critical bottleneck: prediction lacks supervision for agent intentions, while planning requires this information. Existing prediction models, despite strong benchmarking performance, often remain disconnected from planning constraints such as collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. We introduce Plan TRansformer (PTR), a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. A teacher-student training strategy progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable. PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to the baseline Motion Transformer (MTR) and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer. The architecture-agnostic design enables application to diverse Transformer-based prediction models. Project Website: https://github.com/SelzerConst/PlanTRansformer

Authors: Anup Teejo Mathew, Anees Peringal, Daniele Caradonna, Frederic Boyer, Federico Renda

Differentiable contact kinematics are essential for gradient-based methods in robotics, yet the mapping from robot state to contact distance, location, and normal becomes non-smooth in degenerate configurations of shapes with zero or undefined curvature. We address this inherent limitation by selectively regularizing such geometries into strictly convex implicit representations, restoring uniqueness and smoothness of the contact map. Leveraging this geometric regularization, we develop iDCOL, an implicit differentiable collision detection and contact kinematics framework. iDCOL represents colliding bodies using strictly convex implicit surfaces and computes collision detection and contact kinematics by solving a fixed-size nonlinear system derived from a geometric scaling-based convex optimization formulation. By applying the Implicit Function Theorem to the resulting system residual, we derive analytical derivatives of the contact kinematic quantities. We develop a fast Newton-based solver for iDCOL and provide an open-source C++ implementation of the framework. The robustness of the approach is evaluated through extensive collision simulations and benchmarking, and applicability is demonstrated in gradient-based kinematic path planning and differentiable contact physics, including multi-body rigid collisions and a soft-robot interaction example.

Authors: Max H. Cohen, Pio Ong, Aaron D. Ames

Guaranteeing safety in the presence of unmatched disturbances -- uncertainties that cannot be directly canceled by the control input -- remains a key challenge in nonlinear control. This paper presents a constructive approach to safety-critical control of nonlinear systems with unmatched disturbances. We first present a generalization of the input-to-state safety (ISSf) framework for systems with these uncertainties using the recently developed notion of an Optimal Decay CBF, which provides more flexibility for satisfying the associated Lyapunov-like conditions for safety. From there, we outline a procedure for constructing ISSf-CBFs for two relevant classes of systems with unmatched uncertainties: i) strict-feedback systems; ii) dual-relative-degree systems, which are similar to differentially flat systems. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations of an inverted pendulum and planar quadrotor.

Authors: Xinhang Ma, Junlin Wu, Yiannis Kantaros, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik

Designing provably safe control is a core problem in trustworthy autonomy. However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward.

Authors: Yixiang Chen, Peiyan Li, Jiabing Yang, Keji He, Xiangnan Wu, Yuan Xu, Kai Wang, Jing Liu, Nianfeng Liu, Yan Huang, Liang Wang

Embodied world models have emerged as a promising paradigm in robotics, most of which leverage large-scale Internet videos or pretrained video generation models to enrich visual and motion priors. However, they still face key challenges: a misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoint, and non-unified architectures across embodiments. To this end, we present BridgeV2W, which converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks rendered from the URDF and camera parameters. These masks are then injected into a pretrained video generation model via a ControlNet-style pathway, which aligns the action control signals with predicted videos, adds view-specific conditioning to accommodate camera viewpoints, and yields a unified world model architecture across embodiments. To mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds, BridgeV2W further introduces a flow-based motion loss that focuses on learning dynamic and task-relevant regions. Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets, covering diverse and challenging conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, show that BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the potential of BridgeV2W on downstream real-world tasks, including policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning.

Authors: Yuhao Xu, Yantai Yang, Zhenyang Fan, Yufan Liu, Yuming Li, Bing Li, Zhipeng Zhang

The advent of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represents a significant leap for embodied intelligence, yet their immense computational demands critically hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware. Code will be released.

Authors: Fabian Schramm, Franki Nguimatsia Tiofack, Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert, Marc Toussaint, Justin Carpentier

Sampling-based controllers, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) methods, offer substantial flexibility but often suffer from high variance and low sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework that integrates a prior model into the sampling process. Our key insight is to decompose the objective function into a known approximate model and a residual term. Since the residual captures only the discrepancy between the model and the objective, it typically exhibits a smaller magnitude and lower variance than the original objective. Although this principle applies to general modeling choices, we demonstrate that adopting a quadratic approximation enables the derivation of a closed-form, model-guided prior that effectively concentrates samples in informative regions. Crucially, the framework is agnostic to the source of geometric information, allowing the quadratic model to be constructed from exact derivatives, structural approximations (e.g., Gauss- or Quasi-Newton), or gradient-free randomized smoothing. We validate the approach on standard optimization benchmarks, a nonlinear, underactuated cart-pole control task, and a contact-rich manipulation problem with non-smooth dynamics. Across these domains, we achieve faster convergence and superior performance in low-sample regimes compared to standard MPPI. These results suggest that the method can make sample-based control strategies more practical in scenarios where obtaining samples is expensive or limited.

Authors: Yu-Hsiang Chen, Wei-Jer Chang, Christian Kotulla, Thomas Keutgens, Steffen Runde, Tobias Moers, Christoph Klas, Wei Zhan, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Yi-Ting Chen

We present HetroD, a dataset and benchmark for developing autonomous driving systems in heterogeneous environments. HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

### 10. [CRL-VLA: Continual Vision-Language-Action Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03445v1)

Authors: Qixin Zeng, Shuo Zhang, Hongyin Zhang, Renjie Wang, Han Zhao, Libang Zhao, Runze Li, Donglin Wang, Chao Huang

Lifelong learning is critical for embodied agents in open-world environments, where reinforcement learning fine-tuning has emerged as an important paradigm to enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to master dexterous manipulation through environmental interaction. Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes these conflicting objectives, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting and forward adaptation.

Authors: Chao Shen, Zihan Guo, Xu Wan, Zhenghao Yang, Yifan Zhang, Wengi Huang, Jie Song, Zongyan Zhang, Mingyang Sun

Growing renewable penetration introduces substantial uncertainty into power system operations, necessitating frequent adaptation of dispatch objectives and constraints and challenging expertise-intensive, near-real-time modeling workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for automating this process by translating natural-language (NL) operational requirements into executable optimization models via semantic reasoning and code synthesis. Yet existing LLM datasets and benchmarks for optimization modeling primarily target coarse-grained cross-domain generalization, offering limited, rigorous evaluation in power-system settings, particularly for Optimal Power Flow (OPF). We therefore introduce \textbf{ProOPF-D} and \textbf{ProOPF-B}, a dataset and benchmark for professional-grade OPF modeling: ProOPF-D contains 12K instances pairing NL requests with parameter adjustments and structural extensions to a canonical OPF, together with executable implementations; ProOPF-B provides 121 expert-annotated test cases with ground-truth code, enabling end-to-end evaluation under both concrete and abstract OPF modeling regimes.

Static Analysis Tools (SATs) are central to security engineering activities, as they enable early identification of code weaknesses without requiring execution. However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that such SATD-encoded information can be a meaningful complement to SAT-driven security analysis, while helping to overcome some of SATs' practical shortcomings.

Authors: Ruwei Pan, Yakun Zhang, Qingyuan Liang, Yueheng Zhu, Chao Liu, Lu Zhang, Hongyu Zhang

Code generation has advanced rapidly with code-focused large language models (LLMs), especially on snippet-level tasks. However, application-level generation requires producing a runnable multi-file repository with correct structure, dependencies, and end-to-end executability, and real-world software must satisfy both functional correctness and non-functional quality (e.g., maintainability, security). Existing benchmarks provide a limited execution-based assessment of these requirements at the application level. We ask: Can current LLMs generate application-level repositories that meet both functional and non-functional criteria? We propose RAL-Bench, a benchmark and evaluation framework for application-level code generation. For each task, we distill a concise natural-language requirement from a high-quality reference project, build black-box system tests covering functional and non-functional attributes, and keep only tests that pass on the reference repository to ensure a sound oracle and an end-to-end executable suite. Functional correctness is measured by system-test pass rate. Non-functional quality is measured along five ISO/IEC 25010-inspired dimensions and aggregated with an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-derived weight vector, with per-dimension diagnostics and baseline-normalized scoring using reference measurements. Across 16 LLMs evaluated zero-shot with greedy decoding, functional correctness is the dominant bottleneck: no model exceeds a 45% functional pass rate under our requirement-driven, reference-validated tests. We release RAL-Bench at https://github.com/Wwstarry/RAL-Bench. .

### 4. [Bridging Online and Offline RL: Contextual Bandit Learning for Multi-Turn Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03806v1)

Authors: Ziru Chen, Dongdong Chen, Ruinan Jin, Yingbin Liang, Yujia Xie, Huan Sun

Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/cobalt.

### 5. [FullStack-Agent: Enhancing Agentic Full-Stack Web Coding via Development-Oriented Testing and Repository Back-Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03798v1)

Authors: Zimu Lu, Houxing Ren, Yunqiao Yang, Ke Wang, Zhuofan Zong, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li

Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become a popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The code is released at https://github.com/mnluzimu/FullStack-Agent.

### 6. [SWE-Refactor: A Repository-Level Benchmark for Real-World LLM-Based Code Refactoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03712v1)

Authors: Yisen Xu, Jinqiu Yang, Tse-Hsun, Chen

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently attracted wide interest for tackling software engineering tasks. In contrast to code generation, refactoring demands precise, semantics-preserving edits that improve program structure, which also makes automated evaluation challenging. However, existing refactoring benchmarks commonly suffer from three shortcomings: limited coverage of refactoring scenarios, the inclusion of instances that mix refactoring with unrelated changes, and insufficient repository-level context for realistic assessment. To mitigate these issues, we introduce SWE-Refactor, a new benchmark for LLM-based code refactoring. SWE-Refactor comprises 1,099 developer-written, behavior-preserving refactorings mined from 18 Java projects, including 922 atomic and 177 compound instances. Each instance is validated via compilation, test execution, and automated refactoring detection tools to ensure correctness. We evaluate nine widely used LLMs on SWE-Refactor, covering models such as GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and CodeLLaMa, to provide representative reference results. Our results show that complex and compound refactorings remain the primary source of failures; notably, an OpenAI Codex agent achieves only 39.4% success on compound instances. We release SWE-Refactor and all evaluation results to facilitate future research on LLM-based code refactoring.

### 7. [CALM: A Self-Adaptive Orchestration Approach for QoS-Aware Routing in Small Language Model based Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03632v1)

Authors: Hemang Jain, Divyansh Pandey, Karthik Vaidhyanathan

AI-enabled systems are subjected to various types of runtime uncertainties, ranging from dynamic workloads, resource requirements, model drift, etc. These uncertainties have a big impact on the overall Quality of Service (QoS). This is particularly true in the case of Language Model (LM) enabled systems where the autoregressive nature of token generation introduces variability in latency, energy usage and response quality. These systems, powered by LLMs, are either resource-intensive (if run on-prem) or raise privacy/cost concerns (if leveraged using APIs). While deploying a Small Language Model (SLM) can be resource-efficient, it often falls short in addressing the diversity and scale of real-world requirements. To this, we argue that, rather than relying on any one SLM, leveraging a coordinated fleet of SLMs, each with specialized strengths can enable systems to dynamically adapt to shifting contexts and workload patterns. However, realizing the full potential of such an approach demands intelligent orchestration and continuous adaptation. To this end, we introduce CALM , a self-adaptive orchestration mechanism based on MAPE-K. Our approach continuously monitors user queries, analyzes the QoS metrics of the SLMs, identifies the optimal SLM to be used, routes the query to the identified SLM and further to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency, leverages caching and scheduling to decide the SLMs to be kept in memory. Our evaluation shows that CALM reduces latency by approximately 40% and energy consumption by 50%, while preserving domain-specific task performance when compared to single-LLM baselines.

### 8. [SWE-World: Building Software Engineering Agents in Docker-Free Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03419v1)

Authors: Shuang Sun, Huatong Song, Lisheng Huang, Jinhao Jiang, Ran Le, Zhihao Lv, Zongchao Chen, Yiwen Hu, Wenyang Luo, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yang Song, Hongteng Xu, Tao Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled software engineering agents to tackle complex code modification tasks. Most existing approaches rely on execution feedback from containerized environments, which require dependency-complete setup and physical execution of programs and tests. While effective, this paradigm is resource-intensive and difficult to maintain, substantially complicating agent training and limiting scalability. We propose SWE-World, a Docker-free framework that replaces physical execution environments with a learned surrogate for training and evaluating software engineering agents. SWE-World leverages LLM-based models trained on real agent-environment interaction data to predict intermediate execution outcomes and final test feedback, enabling agents to learn without interacting with physical containerized environments. This design preserves the standard agent-environment interaction loop while eliminating the need for costly environment construction and maintenance during agent optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, because SWE-World can simulate the final evaluation outcomes of candidate trajectories without real submission, it enables selecting the best solution among multiple test-time attempts, thereby facilitating effective test-time scaling (TTS) in software engineering tasks. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that SWE-World raises Qwen2.5-Coder-32B from 6.2\% to 52.0\% via Docker-free SFT, 55.0\% with Docker-free RL, and 68.2\% with further TTS. The code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/SWE-World

### 9. [Multi-Level Testing of Conversational AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03311v1)

Authors: Elena Masserini

Conversational AI systems combine AI-based solutions with the flexibility of conversational interfaces. However, most existing testing solutions do not straightforwardly adapt to the characteristics of conversational interaction or to the behavior of AI components. To address this limitation, this Ph.D. thesis investigates a new family of testing approaches for conversational AI systems, focusing on the validation of their constituent elements at different levels of granularity, from the integration between the language and the AI components, to individual conversational agents, up to multi-agent implementations of conversational AI systems

### 10. [Scaling Test-Driven Code Generation from Functions to Classes: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03557v1)

Authors: Yunhao Liang, Ruixuan Ying, Shiwen Ni, Zhe Cui

Test-driven development (TDD) has been adopted to improve Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation by using tests as executable specifications. However, existing TDD-style code generation studies are largely limited to function-level tasks, leaving class-level synthesis where multiple methods interact through shared state and call dependencies underexplored. In this paper, we scale test-driven code generation from functions to classes via an iterative TDD framework. Our approach first analyzes intra-class method dependencies to derive a feasible generation schedule, and then incrementally implements each method under method-level public tests with reflection-style execution feedback and bounded repair iterations. To support test-driven generation and rigorous class-level evaluation, we construct ClassEval-TDD, a cleaned and standardized variant of ClassEval with consistent specifications, deterministic test environments, and complete method-level public tests. We conduct an empirical study across eight LLMs and compare against the strongest direct-generation baseline (the best of holistic, incremental, and compositional strategies). Our class-level TDD framework consistently improves class-level correctness by 12 to 26 absolute points and achieves up to 71% fully correct classes, while requiring only a small number of repairs on average. These results demonstrate that test-driven generation can effectively scale beyond isolated functions and substantially improve class-level code generation reliability.

### Social and Information Networks

### 1. [In Bad Faith: Assessing Discussion Quality on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03090v1)

Authors: Celia Chen, Alex Leitch, William Jordan Conway, Eric Cotugno, Emily Klein, Rajesh Kumar Gnanasekaran, Kristin Buckstad Hamilton, Casi Sherman, Celia Sterrn, Logan C. Stevens, Rebecca Zarrella, Jennifer Golbeck

The quality of a user's social media experience is determined both by the content they see and by the quality of the conversation and interaction around it. In this paper, we look at replies to tweets from mainstream media outlets and official government agencies and assess if they are good faith, engaging honestly and constructively with the original post, or bad faith, attacking the author or derailing the conversation. We assess automated approaches that may help in making this determination and then show that within our dataset of replies to mainstream media outlets and government agencies, bad faith interactions constitute 68.3% of all replies we studied, suggesting potential concerns about the quality of discourse in these specific conversational contexts. This is particularly true from verified accounts, where 91.7% of replies were bad faith. Given that verified accounts are algorithmically amplified, we discuss the implications of our work for understanding the user experience on social media.

### 2. [Link Fraction Mixed Membership Reveals Community Diversity in Aggregated Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03266v1)

Authors: Gamal Adel, Eszter Bokányi, Eelke M. Heemskerk, Frank W. Takes

Community detection is a critical tool for understanding the mesoscopic structure of large-scale networks. However, when applied to aggregated or coarse-grained social networks, disjoint community partitions cannot capture the diverse composition of community memberships within aggregated nodes. While existing mixed membership methods alleviate this issue, they may detected communities that are highly sensitive to the aggregation resolution, not reliably reflecting the underlying community structure of the underlying individual-level network. This paper presents the Link Fraction Mixed Membership (LFMM) method, which computes the mixed memberships of nodes in aggregated networks. Unlike existing mixed membership methods, LFMM is consistent under aggregation. Specifically, we show that it conserves community membership sums at different scales. The method is utilized to study a population-scale social network of the Netherlands, aggregated at different resolutions. Experiments reveal variation in community membership across different geographical regions and evolution over the last decade. In particular, we show how our method identifies large urban hubs that act as the melting pots of diverse, spatially remote communities.

### 3. ["Why I Took the Blackpill": A Thematic Analysis of the Radicalization Process in Incel Communities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03089v1)

Authors: Jennifer Golbeck, Celia Chen, Alex Leitch

Incels, or "involuntary celibates", are an extreme, misogynistic hate group that exists entirely online. Members of the community have been linked to acts of offline violence, including mass shootings. Previous research has engaged with the ideologies and beliefs of incels, but none has looked specifically at the radicalization process. In this paper, we perform a thematic analysis on social media posts where incels describe their own radicalization process. We identified six major themes grouped into four chronological steps: Pre-radicalization (themes of Appearance, Social Isolation, and Psychological issues), Searching for Blame, Radicalization, and Post Radicalization. These results align closely with existing work on radicalization among other extremist groups, bringing incel radicalization inline with a growing body of research on understanding and managing radicalization.

### 4. [From semantic memory to collective creativity: A generative cognitive foundation for social creativity models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03068v1)

Authors: Mirza Nayeem Ahmed, Raiyan Abdul Baten

Simulation-based theory development has yielded powerful insights into collective performance by linking social structure to emergent outcomes, yet it has struggled to extend to collective creativity. Creativity is hard to capture purely at the social level, as novel ideas are generated through cognitive mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce a multi-level socio-cognitive agent-based framework in which agents share a common semantic vocabulary and substrate but differ in semantic network topology. A single generative parameter tunes semantic modularity, yielding emergent individual differences in ideational breadth. When agents exchange ideation traces, two canonical social-creativity phenomena arise without being imposed: lower pre-interaction ideation overlap predicts larger stimulation gains, and shared inspiration sources induce network-level redundancy. The framework enables mechanistic theory-building about cognition and social structure in collective creativity.

### 5. [An Empirical Study of Collective Behaviors and Social Dynamics in Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03775v1)

Authors: Farnoosh Hashemi, Michael W. Macy

Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate our social, cultural, and political interactions. While they can simulate some aspects of human behavior and decision-making, it is still underexplored whether repeated interactions with other agents amplify their biases or lead to exclusionary behaviors. To this end, we study Chirper.ai-an LLM-driven social media platform-analyzing 7M posts and interactions among 32K LLM agents over a year. We start with homophily and social influence among LLMs, learning that similar to humans', their social networks exhibit these fundamental phenomena. Next, we study the toxic language of LLMs, its linguistic features, and their interaction patterns, finding that LLMs show different structural patterns in toxic posting than humans. After studying the ideological leaning in LLMs posts, and the polarization in their community, we focus on how to prevent their potential harmful activities. We present a simple yet effective method, called Chain of Social Thought (CoST), that reminds LLM agents to avoid harmful posting.

### Machine Learning (Statistics Category)

### 1. [A Novel approach to portfolio construction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03325v1)

Authors: T. Di Matteo, L. Riso, M. G. Zoia

This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for asset selection and portfolio construction, termed the Best-Path Algorithm Sparse Graphical Model (BPASGM). The method extends the Best-Path Algorithm (BPA) by mapping linear and non-linear dependencies among a large set of financial assets into a sparse graphical model satisfying a structural Markov property. Based on this representation, BPASGM performs a dependence-driven screening that removes positively or redundantly connected assets, isolating subsets that are conditionally independent or negatively correlated. This step is designed to enhance diversification and reduce estimation error in high-dimensional portfolio settings. Portfolio optimization is then conducted on the selected subset using standard mean-variance techniques. BPASGM does not aim to improve the theoretical mean-variance optimum under known population parameters, but rather to enhance realized performance in finite samples, where sample-based Markowitz portfolios are highly sensitive to estimation error. Monte Carlo simulations show that BPASGM-based portfolios achieve more stable risk-return profiles, lower realized volatility, and superior risk-adjusted performance compared to standard mean-variance portfolios. Empirical results for U.S. equities, global stock indices, and foreign exchange rates over 1990-2025 confirm these findings and demonstrate a substantial reduction in portfolio cardinality. Overall, BPASGM offers a statistically grounded and computationally efficient framework that integrates sparse graphical modeling with portfolio theory for dependence-aware asset selection.

### 2. [Preference-based Conditional Treatment Effects and Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03823v1)

Authors: Dovid Parnas, Mathieu Even, Julie Josse, Uri Shalit

We introduce a new preference-based framework for conditional treatment effect estimation and policy learning, built on the Conditional Preference-based Treatment Effect (CPTE). CPTE requires only that outcomes be ranked under a preference rule, unlocking flexible modeling of heterogeneous effects with multivariate, ordinal, or preference-driven outcomes. This unifies applications such as conditional probability of necessity and sufficiency, conditional Win Ratio, and Generalized Pairwise Comparisons. Despite the intrinsic non-identifiability of comparison-based estimands, CPTE provides interpretable targets and delivers new identifiability conditions for previous unidentifiable estimands. We present estimation strategies via matching, quantile, and distributional regression, and further design efficient influence-function estimators to correct plug-in bias and maximize policy value. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments demonstrate clear performance gains and practical impact.

### 3. [Universal One-third Time Scaling in Learning Peaked Distributions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03685v1)

Authors: Yizhou Liu, Ziming Liu, Cengiz Pehlevan, Jeff Gore

Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, partly because the loss exhibits slow power-law convergence whose origin remains debatable. Through systematic analysis of toy models and empirical evaluation of LLMs, we show that this behavior can arise intrinsically from the use of softmax and cross-entropy. When learning peaked probability distributions, e.g., next-token distributions, these components yield power-law vanishing losses and gradients, creating a fundamental optimization bottleneck. This ultimately leads to power-law time scaling of the loss with a universal exponent of $1/3$. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for observed neural scaling and suggest new directions for improving LLM training efficiency.

### 4. [Simulation-Based Inference via Regression Projection and Batched Discrepancies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03613v1)

Authors: Arya Farahi, Jonah Rose, Paul Torrey

We analyze a lightweight simulation-based inference method that infers simulator parameters using only a regression-based projection of the observed data. After fitting a surrogate linear regression once, the procedure simulates small batches at the proposed parameter values and assigns kernel weights based on the resulting batch-residual discrepancy, producing a self-normalized pseudo-posterior that is simple, parallelizable, and requires access only to the fitted regression coefficients rather than raw observations. We formalize the construction as an importance-sampling approximation to a population target that averages over simulator randomness, prove consistency as the number of parameter draws grows, and establish stability in estimating the surrogate regression from finite samples. We then characterize the asymptotic concentration as the batch size increases and the bandwidth shrinks, showing that the pseudo-posterior concentrates on an identified set determined by the chosen projection, thereby clarifying when the method yields point versus set identification. Experiments on a tractable nonlinear model and on a cosmological calibration task using the DREAMS simulation suite illustrate the computational advantages of regression-based projections and the identifiability limitations arising from low-information summaries.

### 5. [Entropic Mirror Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03165v1)

Authors: Anas Cherradi, Yazid Janati, Alain Durmus, Sylvain Le Corff, Yohan Petetin, Julien Stoehr

Importance sampling is a Monte Carlo method which designs estimators of expectations under a target distribution using weighted samples from a proposal distribution. When the target distribution is complex, such as multimodal distributions in highdimensional spaces, the efficiency of importance sampling critically depends on the choice of the proposal distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive scheme for the construction of efficient proposal distributions. Our algorithm promotes efficient exploration of the target distribution by combining global sampling mechanisms with a delayed weighting procedure. The proposed weighting mechanism plays a key role by enabling rapid resampling in regions where the proposal distribution is poorly adapted to the target. Our sampling algorithm is shown to be geometrically convergent under mild assumptions and is illustrated through various numerical experiments.

### 6. [Efficient Variance-reduced Estimation from Generative EHR Models: The SCOPE and REACH Estimators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03730v1)

Authors: Luke Solo, Matthew B. A. McDermott, William F. Parker, Bashar Ramadan, Michael C. Burkhart, Brett K. Beaulieu-Jones

Generative models trained using self-supervision of tokenized electronic health record (EHR) timelines show promise for clinical outcome prediction. This is typically done using Monte Carlo simulation for future patient trajectories. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: sparse estimate distributions that poorly differentiate patient risk levels, extreme computational costs, and high sampling variance. We propose two new estimators: the Sum of Conditional Outcome Probability Estimator (SCOPE) and Risk Estimation from Anticipated Conditional Hazards (REACH), that leverage next-token probability distributions discarded by standard Monte Carlo. We prove both estimators are unbiased and that REACH guarantees variance reduction over Monte Carlo sampling for any model and outcome. Empirically, on hospital mortality prediction in MIMIC-IV using the ETHOS-ARES framework, SCOPE and REACH match 100-sample Monte Carlo performance using only 10-11 samples (95% CI: [9,11]), representing a ~10x reduction in inference cost without degrading calibration. For ICU admission prediction, efficiency gains are more modest (~1.2x), which we attribute to the outcome's lower "spontaneity," a property we characterize theoretically and empirically. These methods substantially improve the feasibility of deploying generative EHR models in resource-constrained clinical settings.

### 7. [Anytime Pretraining: Horizon-Free Learning-Rate Schedules with Weight Averaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03702v1)

Authors: Alexandru Meterez, Pranav Ajit Nair, Depen Morwani, Cengiz Pehlevan, Sham Kakade

Large language models are increasingly trained in continual or open-ended settings, where the total training horizon is not known in advance. Despite this, most existing pretraining recipes are not anytime: they rely on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and extensive tuning under a fixed compute budget. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining.

### 8. [Generator-based Graph Generation via Heat Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03612v1)

Authors: Anthony Stephenson, Ian Gallagher, Christopher Nemeth

Graph generative modelling has become an essential task due to the wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, social networks, and knowledge representation. In this work, we propose a novel framework for generating graphs by adapting the Generator Matching (arXiv:2410.20587) paradigm to graph-structured data. We leverage the graph Laplacian and its associated heat kernel to define a continous-time diffusion on each graph. The Laplacian serves as the infinitesimal generator of this diffusion, and its heat kernel provides a family of conditional perturbations of the initial graph. A neural network is trained to match this generator by minimising a Bregman divergence between the true generator and a learnable surrogate. Once trained, the surrogate generator is used to simulate a time-reversed diffusion process to sample new graph structures. Our framework unifies and generalises existing diffusion-based graph generative models, injecting domain-specific inductive bias via the Laplacian, while retaining the flexibility of neural approximators. Experimental studies demonstrate that our approach captures structural properties of real and synthetic graphs effectively.

### 9. [Score-based diffusion models for diffuse optical tomography with uncertainty quantification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03449v1)

Authors: Fabian Schneider, Meghdoot Mozumder, Konstantin Tamarov, Leila Taghizadeh, Tanja Tarvainen, Tapio Helin, Duc-Lam Duong

Score-based diffusion models are a recently developed framework for posterior sampling in Bayesian inverse problems with a state-of-the-art performance for severely ill-posed problems by leveraging a powerful prior distribution learned from empirical data. Despite generating significant interest especially in the machine-learning community, a thorough study of realistic inverse problems in the presence of modelling error and utilization of physical measurement data is still outstanding. In this work, the framework of unconditional representation for the conditional score function (UCoS) is evaluated for linearized difference imaging in diffuse optical tomography (DOT). DOT uses boundary measurements of near-infrared light to estimate the spatial distribution of absorption and scattering parameters in biological tissues. The problem is highly ill-posed and thus sensitive to noise and modelling errors. We introduce a novel regularization approach that prevents overfitting of the score function by constructing a mixed score composed of a learned and a model-based component. Validation of this approach is done using both simulated and experimental measurement data. The experiments demonstrate that a data-driven prior distribution results in posterior samples with low variance, compared to classical model-based estimation, and centred around the ground truth, even in the context of a highly ill-posed problem and in the presence of modelling errors.

### 10. [Riemannian Neural Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03566v1)

Authors: Alessandro Micheli, Yueqi Cao, Anthea Monod, Samir Bhatt

Computational optimal transport (OT) offers a principled framework for generative modeling. Neural OT methods, which use neural networks to learn an OT map (or potential) from data in an amortized way, can be evaluated out of sample after training, but existing approaches are tailored to Euclidean geometry. Extending neural OT to high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds remains an open challenge. In this paper, we prove that any method for OT on manifolds that produces discrete approximations of transport maps necessarily suffers from the curse of dimensionality: achieving a fixed accuracy requires a number of parameters that grows exponentially with the manifold dimension. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps, which are continuous neural-network parameterizations of OT maps on manifolds that avoid discretization and incorporate geometric structure by construction. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that RNOT maps approximate Riemannian OT maps with sub-exponential complexity in the dimension. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved scalability and competitive performance relative to discretization-based baselines.

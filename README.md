### Artificial Intelligence

### 1. [ROCKET: Rapid Optimization via Calibration-guided Knapsack Enhanced Truncation for Efficient Model Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11008v1)

Authors: Ammar Ali, Baher Mohammad, Denis Makhov, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Magauiya Zhussip, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis

We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\% of the original model's performance at 30\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.

### 2. [Enhancing Predictability of Multi-Tenant DNN Inference for Autonomous Vehicles' Perception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11004v1)

Authors: Liangkai Liu, Kang G. Shin, Jinkyu Lee, Chengmo Yang, Weisong Shi

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.

### 3. [RiemannGL: Riemannian Geometry Changes Graph Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10982v1)

Authors: Li Sun, Qiqi Wan, Suyang Zhou, Zhenhao Huang, Philip S. Yu

Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.

### 4. [Can LLMs Cook Jamaican Couscous? A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10964v1)

Authors: F. Carichon, R. Rampa, G. Farnadi

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.

### 5. [Search or Accelerate: Confidence-Switched Position Beam Search for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10953v1)

Authors: Mingyu Cao, Alvaro Correia, Christos Louizos, Shiwei Liu, Lu Yin

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) generate text by iteratively denoising a masked sequence, repeatedly deciding which positions to commit at each step. Standard decoding follows a greedy rule: unmask the most confident positions, yet this local choice can lock the model into a suboptimal unmasking order, especially on reasoning-heavy prompts. We present SOAR, a training-free decoding algorithm that adapts its behavior to the model's uncertainty. When confidence is low, SOAR briefly widens the search over alternative unmasking decisions to avoid premature commitments; when confidence is high, it collapses the search and decodes many positions in parallel to reduce the number of denoising iterations. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks (GSM8K, MBPP, HumanEval) on Dream-7B and LLaDA-8B, SOAR improves generation quality while maintaining competitive inference speed, offering a practical way to balance quality and efficiency in DLM decoding.

### 6. [The CLEF-2026 FinMMEval Lab: Multilingual and Multimodal Evaluation of Financial AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10886v1)

Authors: Zhuohan Xie, Rania Elbadry, Fan Zhang, Georgi Georgiev, Xueqing Peng, Lingfei Qian, Jimin Huang, Dimitar Dimitrov, Vanshikaa Jani, Yuyang Dai, Jiahui Geng, Yuxia Wang, Ivan Koychev, Veselin Stoyanov, Preslav Nakov

We present the setup and the tasks of the FinMMEval Lab at CLEF 2026, which introduces the first multilingual and multimodal evaluation framework for financial Large Language Models (LLMs). While recent advances in financial natural language processing have enabled automated analysis of market reports, regulatory documents, and investor communications, existing benchmarks remain largely monolingual, text-only, and limited to narrow subtasks. FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making. Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures models' ability to reason, generalize, and act across diverse languages and modalities. The lab aims to promote the development of robust, transparent, and globally inclusive financial AI systems, with datasets and evaluation resources publicly released to support reproducible research.

### 7. [ICA: Information-Aware Credit Assignment for Visually Grounded Long-Horizon Information-Seeking Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10863v1)

Authors: Cong Pang, Xuyu Feng, Yujie Yi, Zixuan Chen, Jiawei Hong, Tiankuo Yao, Nang Yuan, Jiapeng Luo, Lewei Lu, Xin Lou

Despite the strong performance achieved by reinforcement learning-trained information-seeking agents, learning in open-ended web environments remains severely constrained by low signal-to-noise feedback. Text-based parsers often discard layout semantics and introduce unstructured noise, while long-horizon training typically relies on sparse outcome rewards that obscure which retrieval actions actually matter. We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments. The code and datasets will be released in https://github.com/pc-inno/ICA_MM_deepsearch.git.

### 8. [Beyond Confidence: The Rhythms of Reasoning in Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10816v1)

Authors: Deyuan Liu, Zecheng Wang, Zhanyue Qin, Zhiying Tu, Dianhui Chu, Dianbo Sui

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities yet suffer from sensitivity to slight input context variations, hampering reliability. Conventional metrics like accuracy and perplexity fail to assess local prediction robustness, as normalized output probabilities can obscure the underlying resilience of an LLM's internal state to perturbations. We introduce the Token Constraint Bound ($δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$), a novel metric that quantifies the maximum internal state perturbation an LLM can withstand before its dominant next-token prediction significantly changes. Intrinsically linked to output embedding space geometry, $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ provides insights into the stability of the model's internal predictive commitment. Our experiments show $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ correlates with effective prompt engineering and uncovers critical prediction instabilities missed by perplexity during in-context learning and text generation. $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ offers a principled, complementary approach to analyze and potentially improve the contextual stability of LLM predictions.

### 9. [RSHallu: Dual-Mode Hallucination Evaluation for Remote-Sensing Multimodal Large Language Models with Domain-Tailored Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10799v1)

Authors: Zihui Zhou, Yong Feng, Yanying Chen, Guofan Duan, Zhenxi Song, Mingliang Zhou, Weijia Jia

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly adopted in remote sensing (RS) and have shown strong performance on tasks such as RS visual grounding (RSVG), RS visual question answering (RSVQA), and multimodal dialogue. However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG). Code and datasets will be released.

### 10. [Co-jump: Cooperative Jumping with Quadrupedal Robots via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10514v1)

Authors: Shihao Dong, Yeke Chen, Zeren Luo, Jiahui Zhang, Bowen Xu, Jinghan Lin, Yimin Han, Ji Ma, Zhiyou Yu, Yudong Zhao, Peng Lu

While single-agent legged locomotion has witnessed remarkable progress, individual robots remain fundamentally constrained by physical actuation limits. To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [LOREN: Low Rank-Based Code-Rate Adaptation in Neural Receivers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10770v1)

Authors: Bram Van Bolderik, Vlado Menkovski, Sonia Heemstra de Groot, Manil Dev Gomony

Neural network based receivers have recently demonstrated superior system-level performance compared to traditional receivers. However, their practicality is limited by high memory and power requirements, as separate weight sets must be stored for each code rate. To address this challenge, we propose LOREN, a Low Rank-Based Code-Rate Adaptation Neural Receiver that achieves adaptability with minimal overhead. LOREN integrates lightweight low rank adaptation adapters (LOREN adapters) into convolutional layers, freezing a shared base network while training only small adapters per code rate. An end-to-end training framework over 3GPP CDL channels ensures robustness across realistic wireless environments. LOREN achieves comparable or superior performance relative to fully retrained base neural receivers. The hardware implementation of LOREN in 22nm technology shows more than 65% savings in silicon area and up to 15% power reduction when supporting three code rates.

### 2. [DRAMPyML: A Formal Description of DRAM Protocols with Timed Petri Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10654v1)

Authors: Derek Christ, Thomas Zimmermann, Philippe Barbie, Dmitri Saberi, Yao Yin, Matthias Jung

The JEDEC committee defines various domain-specific DRAM standards. These standards feature increasingly complex and evolving protocol specifications, which are detailed in timing diagrams and command tables. Understanding these protocols is becoming progressively challenging as new features and complex device hierarchies are difficult to comprehend without an expressive model. While each JEDEC standard features a simplified state machine, this state machine fails to reflect the parallel operation of memory banks.
  In this paper, we present an evolved modeling approach based on timed Petri nets and Python. This model provides a more accurate representation of DRAM protocols, making them easier to understand and directly executable, which enables the evaluation of interesting metrics and the verification of controller RTL models, DRAM logic and memory simulators.

### 3. [Reed-Muller Error-Correction Code Encoder for SFQ-to-CMOS Interface Circuits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11140v1)

Authors: Yerzhan Mustafa, Berker Peköz, Selçuk Köse

Data transmission from superconducting digital electronics such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic to semiconductor (CMOS) circuits is subject to bit errors due to, e.g., flux trapping, process parameter variations (PPV), and fabrication defects. In this paper, a lightweight hardware-efficient error-correction code encoder is designed and analyzed. Particularly, a Reed-Muller code RM(1,3) encoder is implemented with SFQ digital logic. The proposed RM(1,3) encoder converts a 4-bit message into an 8-bit codeword and can detect and correct up to 3- and 1-bit errors, respectively. This encoder circuit is designed using MIT-LL SFQ5ee process and SuperTools/ColdFlux RSFQ cell library. A simulation framework integrating JoSIM simulator and MATLAB script for automated data collection and analysis, is proposed to study the performance of RM(1,3) encoder. The proposed encoder improves the probability of having no bit errors by 6.7% as compared to an encoder-less design under $\pm20\%$ PPV. With $\pm15\%$ and lower PPV, the proposed encoder could correct all errors with at least 99.1% probability. The impact of fabrication defects such as open circuit faults on the encoder circuit is also studied using the proposed framework.

### 4. [Scaling Routers with In-Package Optics and High-Bandwidth Memories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10505v1)

Authors: Isaac Keslassy, Ilay Yavlovich, Jose Yallouz, Tzu-Chien Hsueh, Yeshaiahu Fainman, Bill Lin

This paper aims to apply two major scaling transformations from the computing packaging industry to internet routers: the heterogeneous integration of high-bandwidth memories (HBMs) and chiplets, as well as in-package optics. We propose a novel internet router architecture that employs these technologies to achieve a petabit/sec router within a single integrated package. At the top-level, we introduce a novel split-parallel switch architecture that spatially divides (without processing) the incoming fibers and distributes them across smaller independent switches without intermediate OEO conversions or fine-tuned per-packet load-balancing. This passive spatial division enables scaling at the cost of a coarser traffic load balancing. Yet, through extensive evaluations of backbone network traffic, we demonstrate that differences with fine-tuned approaches are small. In addition, we propose a novel HBM-based shared-memory architecture for the implementation of the smaller independent switches, and we introduce a novel parallel frame interleaving algorithm that packs traffic into frames so that HBM banks are accessed at peak HBM data rates in a cyclical interleaving manner. We further discuss why these new technologies represent a paradigm shift in the design of future internet routers. Finally, we emphasize that power consumption may constitute the primary bottleneck to scaling.

### 5. [From Buffers to Registers: Unlocking Fine-Grained FlashAttention with Hybrid-Bonded 3D NPU Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11016v1)

Authors: Jinxin Yu, Yudong Pan, Mengdi Wang, Huawei Li, Yinhe Han, Xiaowei Li, Ying Wang

Transformer-based models dominate modern AI workloads but exacerbate memory bottlenecks due to their quadratic attention complexity and ever-growing model sizes. Existing accelerators, such as Groq and Cerebras, mitigate off-chip traffic with large on-chip caches, while algorithmic innovations such as FlashAttention fuse operators to avoid materializing large attention matrices. However, as off-chip traffic decreases, our measurements show that on-chip SRAM accesses account for over 60% of energy in long-sequence workloads, making cache access the new bottleneck. We propose 3D-Flow, a hybrid-bonded, 3D-stacked spatial accelerator that enables register-to-register communication across vertically partitioned PE tiers. Unlike 2D multi-array architectures limited by NoC-based router-to-router transfers, 3D-Flow leverages sub-10 um vertical TSVs to sustain cycle-level operator pipelining with minimal overhead. On top of this architecture, we design 3D-FlashAttention, a fine-grained scheduling method that balances latency across tiers, forming a bubble-free vertical dataflow without on-chip SRAM roundtrips. Evaluations on Transformer workloads (OPT and QWEN models) show that our 3D spatial accelerator reduces 46-93% energy consumption and achieves 1.4x-7.6x speedups compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D designs.

### 6. [Fault Tolerant Design of IGZO-based Binary Search ADCs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10790v1)

Authors: Paula Carolina Lozano Duarte, Sule Ozev, Mehdi Tahoori

Thin-film technologies such as Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO) enable Flexible Electronics (FE) for emerging applications in wearable sensing, personal health monitoring, and large-area systems. Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) serve as critical sensor interfaces in these systems. Yet, their vulnerability to manufacturing defects remains poorly understood despite unipolar technologies' inherently high defect densities and process variations compared to mature CMOS technologies. We present a hierarchical fault injection framework to characterize defect sensitivity in Binary Search ADCs implemented in n-type only technologies. Our methodology combines transistor-level defect characterization with system-level fault propagation analysis, enabling efficient exploration of both single and multiple fault scenarios across the conversion hierarchy. The framework identifies critical fault-sensitive circuit components and enables selective redundancy strategies targeting only the most sensitive components. The resulting defect-tolerant designs improve fault coverage from 60% to 92% under single-fault injections and from 34% to 77.6% under multi-fault injection, while incurring only 4.2% area overhead and 6% power increase. While validated on IGZO-TFTs, the methodology applies to all emerging unipolar technologies.

### 7. [Vulnerabilities in Partial TEE-Shielded LLM Inference with Precomputed Noise](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11088v1)

Authors: Abhishek Saini, Haolin Jiang, Hang Liu

The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on third-party devices requires new ways to protect model intellectual property. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer a promising solution, their performance limits can lead to a critical compromise: using a precomputed, static secret basis to accelerate cryptographic operations. We demonstrate that this mainstream design pattern introduces a classic cryptographic flaw, the reuse of secret keying material, into the system's protocol. We prove its vulnerability with two distinct attacks: First, our attack on a model confidentiality system achieves a full confidentiality break by recovering its secret permutations and model weights. Second, our integrity attack completely bypasses the integrity checks of systems like Soter and TSQP. We demonstrate the practicality of our attacks against state-of-the-art LLMs, recovering a layer's secrets from a LLaMA-3 8B model in about 6 minutes and showing the attack scales to compromise 405B-parameter LLMs across a variety of configurations.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [Parameterized Complexity of Finding a Maximum Common Vertex Subgraph Without Isolated Vertices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10948v1)

Authors: Palash Dey, Anubhav Dhar, Ashlesha Hota, Sudeshna Kolay, Aritra Mitra

In this paper, we study the Maximum Common Vertex Subgraph problem: Given two input graphs $G_1,G_2$ and a non-negative integer $h$, is there a common subgraph $H$ on at least $h$ vertices such that there is no isolated vertex in $H$. In other words, each connected component of $H$ has at least $2$ vertices. This problem naturally arises in graph theory along with other variants of the well-studied Maximum Common Subgraph problem and also has applications in computational social choice. We show that this problem is NP-hard and provide an FPT algorithm when parameterized by $h$. Next, we conduct a study of the problem on common structural parameters like vertex cover number, maximum degree, treedepth, pathwidth and treewidth of one or both input graphs. We derive a complete dichotomy of parameterized results for our problem with respect to individual parameterizations as well as combinations of parameterizations from the above structural parameters. This provides us with a deep insight into the complexity theoretic and parameterized landscape of this problem.

### 2. [Implementation of Polynomial NP-Complete Algorithms Based on the NP Verifier Simulation Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10991v1)

Authors: Changryeol Lee

While prior work established a verifier-based polynomial time framework for NP, explicit deterministic machines for concrete NP-complete problems have remained elusive.
  In this paper, we construct fully specified deterministic Turing Machines (DTMs) for SAT and Subset-Sum within a polynomial-time NP verifier simulation framework.
  We show that both machines operate in polynomial time and, for satisfiable instances, deterministically generate valid witnesses, thereby extending the framework to deterministic FNP computation without increasing the degree of polynomial complexity. Furthermore, we provide a complete implementation of the framework, including the dynamic computation graph, feasible-graph construction, verification walks, and Turing-machine simulation via edge extensions. The implementation behaves in accordance with the predicted polynomial-time bounds.
  To ensure transparency and reproducibility, the complete Python implementation and source code are made available in a public online repository.

### 3. [Necessary President in Elections with Parties](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10601v1)

Authors: Katarína Cechlárová, Ildikó Schlotter

Consider an election where the set of candidates is partitioned into parties, and each party must choose exactly one candidate to nominate for the election held over all nominees. The Necessary President problem asks whether a candidate, if nominated, becomes the winner of the election for all possible nominations from other parties.
  We study the computational complexity of Necessary President for several voting rules. We show that while this problem is solvable in polynomial time for Borda, Maximin, and Copeland$^α$ for every $α\in [0,1]$, it is $\mathsf{coNP}$-complete for general classes of positional scoring rules that include $\ell$-Approval and $\ell$-Veto, even when the maximum size of a party is two. For such positional scoring rules, we show that Necessary President is $\mathsf{W}[2]$-hard when parameterized by the number of parties, but fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the number of voter types. Additionally, we prove that Necessary President for Ranked Pairs is $\mathsf{coNP}$-complete even for maximum party size two, and $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard with respect to the number of parties; remarkably, both of these results hold even for constant number of voters.

### 4. [Self-referential instances of the dominating set problem are irreducible](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10559v1)

Authors: Guangyan Zhou

We study the algorithmic decidability of the domination number in the Erdos-Renyi random graph model $G(n,p)$. We show that for a carefully chosen edge probability $p=p(n)$, the domination problem exhibits a strong irreducible property. Specifically, for any constant $0<c<1$, no algorithm that inspects only an induced subgraph of order at most $n^c$ can determine whether $G(n,p)$ contains a dominating set of size $k=\ln n$. We demonstrate that the existence of such a dominating set can be flipped by a local symmetry mapping that alters only a constant number of edges, thereby producing indistinguishable random graph instances which require exhaustive search. These results demonstrate that the extreme hardness of the dominating set problem in random graphs cannot be attributed to local structure, but instead arises from the self-referential nature and near-independence structure of the entire solution space.

### Computational Engineering

### 1. [The CLEF-2026 FinMMEval Lab: Multilingual and Multimodal Evaluation of Financial AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10886v1)

Authors: Zhuohan Xie, Rania Elbadry, Fan Zhang, Georgi Georgiev, Xueqing Peng, Lingfei Qian, Jimin Huang, Dimitar Dimitrov, Vanshikaa Jani, Yuyang Dai, Jiahui Geng, Yuxia Wang, Ivan Koychev, Veselin Stoyanov, Preslav Nakov

We present the setup and the tasks of the FinMMEval Lab at CLEF 2026, which introduces the first multilingual and multimodal evaluation framework for financial Large Language Models (LLMs). While recent advances in financial natural language processing have enabled automated analysis of market reports, regulatory documents, and investor communications, existing benchmarks remain largely monolingual, text-only, and limited to narrow subtasks. FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making. Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures models' ability to reason, generalize, and act across diverse languages and modalities. The lab aims to promote the development of robust, transparent, and globally inclusive financial AI systems, with datasets and evaluation resources publicly released to support reproducible research.

### 2. [Navigating heterogeneous protein landscapes through geometry-aware smoothing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10422v1)

Authors: Srinivas Anumasa, Barath Chandran, Tingting Chen, Nuwaisir Mohammad Rahman, Yingtao Zhu, Rushi Shah, Hongyu He, Peisong Zhang, Yizhen Liao, Yiming Tang, Yong Shen, Tianfan Fu, Rui Qing, Xiao Li, Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, Xinyi Su, Zhizhuo Zhang, Dianbo Liu

The evolutionary fitness landscape of biological molecules is extremely sparse and heterogeneous, with functional sequences forming isolated dense ``islands'' within a vast combinatorial space of largely non-functional variants. Protein sequences, in particular, exemplify this structure, yet most generative artificial intelligence models implicitly assume a homogeneous data distribution. We show that this assumption fundamentally breaks down in heterogeneous biological sequence spaces: fixed global noise levels impose a destructive trade-off, either oversmoothing dense functional clusters or fragmenting sparse regions and producing non-functional hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Density-Dependent Smoothing} (DDS), a geometry-aware generative framework that adapts stochastic smoothing to the local density of the underlying sequence landscape. By inversely coupling diffusion noise to estimated sequence density, DDS enables gentle refinement in high-density functional regions while promoting controlled exploration across sparse regions. Implemented as a plug-in mechanism for discrete molecular sampling, DDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive models across antibody repertoires, therapeutic antibody design, antimicrobial peptide generation and coronavirus antibody design. Together, these results show that fixed global smoothing assumptions fundamentally limit generative modeling in sparse biological sequence spaces, and that geometry-aware smoothing removes this constraint, enabling reliable exploration and design previously unattainable with fixed-noise generative models.

### 3. [Integrating granular data into a multilayer network: an interbank model of the euro area for systemic risk assessment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10960v1)

Authors: Ilias Aarab, Thomas Gottron, Andrea Colombo, Jörg Reddig, Annalauro Ianiro

Micro-structural models of contagion and systemic risk emphasize that shock propagation is inherently multi-channel, spanning counterparty exposures, short-term funding and roll-over risk, securities cross-holdings, and common-asset (fire-sale) spillovers. Empirical implementations, however, often rely on stylized or simulated networks, or focus on a single exposure dimension, reflecting the practical difficulty of reconciling heterogeneous granular collections into a coherent representation with consistent identifiers and consolidation rules. We close part of this gap by constructing an empirically grounded multilayer network for euro area significant banking groups that integrates several supervisory and statistical datasets into layer-consistent exposure matrices defined on a common node set. Each layer corresponds to a distinct transmission channel, long- and short-term credit, securities cross-holdings, short-term secured funding, and overlapping external portfolios, and nodes are enriched with balance-sheet information to support model calibration. We document pronounced cross-layer heterogeneity in connectivity and centrality, and show that an aggregated (flattened) representation can mask economically relevant structure and misidentify the institutions that are systemically important in specific markets. We then illustrate how the resulting network disciplines standard systemic-risk analytics by implementing a centrality-based propagation measure and a micro-structural agent-based framework on real exposures. The approach provides a data-grounded basis for layer-aware systemic-risk assessment and stress testing across multiple dimensions of the banking network.

### 4. [Cross-Sectional Asset Retrieval via Future-Aligned Soft Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10711v1)

Authors: Hyeongmin Lee, Chanyeol Choi, Jihoon Kwon, Yoon Kim, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, Wonbin Ahn, Yongjae Lee

Asset retrieval--finding similar assets in a financial universe--is central to quantitative investment decision-making. Existing approaches define similarity through historical price patterns or sector classifications, but such backward-looking criteria provide no guarantee about future behavior. We argue that effective asset retrieval should be future-aligned: the retrieved assets should be those most likely to exhibit correlated future returns. To this end, we propose Future-Aligned Soft Contrastive Learning (FASCL), a representation learning framework whose soft contrastive loss uses pairwise future return correlations as continuous supervision targets. We further introduce an evaluation protocol designed to directly assess whether retrieved assets share similar future trajectories. Experiments on 4,229 US equities demonstrate that FASCL consistently outperforms 13 baselines across all future-behavior metrics. The source code will be available soon.

Authors: Zhanou Liu, Yuhao Chen, Yingjin Ma, Xiao He, Yuxin Deng

Accurately describing strong electron correlation in complex systems remains a prominent challenge in computational chemistry as near-term quantum algorithms treating total correlation often require prohibitively deep circuits. Here we present a hybrid strategy combining the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory to efficiently decouple correlation effects. This approach confines static correlation to a compact multireference quantum state while recovering dynamic correlation through a classical on-top density functional using reduced-density information. By enabling self-consistent orbital optimization, the method significantly reduces quantum resource overheads without sacrificing physical rigor. We demonstrate chemical accuracy on standard benchmarks by reproducing C$_2$ equilibrium bond lengths and benzene excitation energies with mean absolute errors of 0.006 Å and 0.048 eV respectively. Most notably, for the strongly correlated Cr$_2$ dimer requiring a large complete active space (48e, 42o), the framework yields a bound potential-energy curve and recovers qualitative dissociation behavior despite realistic hardware noise. These results establish that separating correlation types provides a practical route to reliable predictions on near-term quantum hardware.

### 6. [Direct Learning of Calibration-Aware Uncertainty for Neural PDE Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11090v1)

Authors: Carlos Stein Brito

Neural PDE surrogates are often deployed in data-limited or partially observed regimes where downstream decisions depend on calibrated uncertainty in addition to low prediction error. Existing approaches obtain uncertainty through ensemble replication, fixed stochastic noise such as dropout, or post hoc calibration. Cross-regularized uncertainty learns uncertainty parameters during training using gradients routed through a held-out regularization split. The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime noise tuning. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at the output head, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components such as spectral modes. We instantiate the approach in Fourier Neural Operators and evaluate on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size. Across these sweeps, the learned predictive distributions are better calibrated on held-out splits and the resulting uncertainty fields concentrate in high-error regions in one-step spatial diagnostics.

### 1. [Implicit representations via the polynomial method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10922v1)

Authors: Jean Cardinal, Micha Sharir

Semialgebraic graphs are graphs whose vertices are points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and adjacency between two vertices is determined by the truth value of a semialgebraic predicate of constant complexity. We show how to harness polynomial partitioning methods to construct compact adjacency labeling schemes for families of semialgebraic graphs.
  That is, we show that for any family of semialgebraic graphs, given a graph on $n$ vertices in this family, we can assign a label consisting of $O(n^{1-2/(d+1) + \varepsilon})$ bits to each vertex (where $\varepsilon > 0$ can be made arbitrarily small and the constant of proportionality depends on $\varepsilon$ and on the complexity of the adjacency-defining predicate), such that adjacency between two vertices can be determined solely from their two labels, without any additional information. We obtain for instance that unit disk graphs and segment intersection graphs have such labelings with labels of $O(n^{1/3 + \varepsilon})$ bits. This is in contrast to their natural implicit representation consisting of the coordinates of the disk centers or segment endpoints, which sometimes require exponentially many bits. It also improves on the best known bound of $O(n^{1-1/d}\log n)$ for $d$-dimensional semialgebraic families due to Alon (Discrete Comput. Geom., 2024), a bound that holds more generally for graphs with shattering functions bounded by a degree-$d$ polynomial.
  We also give new bounds on the size of adjacency labels for other families of graphs. In particular, we consider semilinear graphs, which are semialgebraic graphs in which the predicate only involves linear polynomials. We show that semilinear graphs have adjacency labels of size $O(\log n)$. We also prove that polygon visibility graphs, which are not semialgebraic in the above sense, have adjacency labels of size $O(\log^3 n)$.

### 2. [Splitting Sandwiches Unevenly via Unique Sink Orientations and Rainbow Arrangements](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10795v1)

Authors: Michaela Borzechowski, Sebastian Haslebacher, Hung P. Hoang, Patrick Schnider, Simon Weber

The famous Ham-Sandwich theorem states that any $d$ point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be simultaneously bisected by a single hyperplane. The $α$-Ham-Sandwich theorem gives a sufficient condition for the existence of biased cuts, i.e., hyperplanes that do not cut off half but some prescribed fraction of each point set. We give two new proofs for this theorem. The first proof is completely combinatorial and highlights a strong connection between the $α$-Ham-Sandwich theorem and Unique Sink Orientations of grids. The second proof uses point-hyperplane duality and the Poincaré-Miranda theorem and allows us to generalize the result to and beyond oriented matroids. For this we introduce a new concept of rainbow arrangements, generalizing colored pseudo-hyperplane arrangements. Along the way, we also show that the realizability problem for rainbow arrangements is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete, which also implies that the realizability problem for grid Unique Sink Orientations is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete.

### 1. [ROCKET: Rapid Optimization via Calibration-guided Knapsack Enhanced Truncation for Efficient Model Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11008v1)

Authors: Ammar Ali, Baher Mohammad, Denis Makhov, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Magauiya Zhussip, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis

We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\% of the original model's performance at 30\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.

### 2. [Search or Accelerate: Confidence-Switched Position Beam Search for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10953v1)

Authors: Mingyu Cao, Alvaro Correia, Christos Louizos, Shiwei Liu, Lu Yin

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) generate text by iteratively denoising a masked sequence, repeatedly deciding which positions to commit at each step. Standard decoding follows a greedy rule: unmask the most confident positions, yet this local choice can lock the model into a suboptimal unmasking order, especially on reasoning-heavy prompts. We present SOAR, a training-free decoding algorithm that adapts its behavior to the model's uncertainty. When confidence is low, SOAR briefly widens the search over alternative unmasking decisions to avoid premature commitments; when confidence is high, it collapses the search and decodes many positions in parallel to reduce the number of denoising iterations. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks (GSM8K, MBPP, HumanEval) on Dream-7B and LLaDA-8B, SOAR improves generation quality while maintaining competitive inference speed, offering a practical way to balance quality and efficiency in DLM decoding.

Authors: Zhuohan Xie, Rania Elbadry, Fan Zhang, Georgi Georgiev, Xueqing Peng, Lingfei Qian, Jimin Huang, Dimitar Dimitrov, Vanshikaa Jani, Yuyang Dai, Jiahui Geng, Yuxia Wang, Ivan Koychev, Veselin Stoyanov, Preslav Nakov

We present the setup and the tasks of the FinMMEval Lab at CLEF 2026, which introduces the first multilingual and multimodal evaluation framework for financial Large Language Models (LLMs). While recent advances in financial natural language processing have enabled automated analysis of market reports, regulatory documents, and investor communications, existing benchmarks remain largely monolingual, text-only, and limited to narrow subtasks. FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making. Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures models' ability to reason, generalize, and act across diverse languages and modalities. The lab aims to promote the development of robust, transparent, and globally inclusive financial AI systems, with datasets and evaluation resources publicly released to support reproducible research.

### 4. [Beyond Confidence: The Rhythms of Reasoning in Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10816v1)

Authors: Deyuan Liu, Zecheng Wang, Zhanyue Qin, Zhiying Tu, Dianhui Chu, Dianbo Sui

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities yet suffer from sensitivity to slight input context variations, hampering reliability. Conventional metrics like accuracy and perplexity fail to assess local prediction robustness, as normalized output probabilities can obscure the underlying resilience of an LLM's internal state to perturbations. We introduce the Token Constraint Bound ($δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$), a novel metric that quantifies the maximum internal state perturbation an LLM can withstand before its dominant next-token prediction significantly changes. Intrinsically linked to output embedding space geometry, $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ provides insights into the stability of the model's internal predictive commitment. Our experiments show $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ correlates with effective prompt engineering and uncovers critical prediction instabilities missed by perplexity during in-context learning and text generation. $δ_{\mathrm{TCB}}$ offers a principled, complementary approach to analyze and potentially improve the contextual stability of LLM predictions.

Authors: Lingzhuang Sun, Yuxia Zhu, Ruitong Liu, Hao Liang, Zheng Sun, Caijun Jia, Honghao He, Yuchen Wu, Siyuan Li, Jingxuan Wei, Xiangxiang Zhang, Bihui Yu, Wentao Zhang

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), relying solely on linear text sequences remains a bottleneck for complex tasks. We observe that even when auxiliary visual elements are interleaved, they are often treated as static snapshots within a one-dimensional, unstructured reasoning chain. We argue that such approaches treat reasoning history as an immutable stream: correcting a local error necessitates either generating verbose downstream corrections or regenerating the entire context. This forces the model to implicitly maintain and track state updates, significantly increasing token consumption and cognitive load. This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional domains, such as geometry and SVG design, where the textual expression of CoT lacks explicit visual guidance, further constraining the model's reasoning precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT)}. By leveraging a HTML Canvas as an external reasoning substrate, Canvas-CoT empowers the model to perform atomic, DOM-based CRUD operations. This architecture enables in-place state revisions without disrupting the surrounding context, allowing the model to explicitly maintain the "ground truth". Furthermore, we integrate a rendering-based critique loop that serves as a hard constraint validator, providing explicit visual feedback to resolve complex tasks that are difficult to articulate through text alone. Extensive experiments on VCode, RBench-V, and MathVista demonstrate that Canvas-CoT significantly outperforms existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for context-efficient multimodal reasoning.

### 6. [Neuro-Symbolic Synergy for Interactive World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10480v1)

Authors: Hongyu Zhao, Siyu Zhou, Haolin Yang, Zengyi Qin, Tianyi Zhou

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose reasoning capabilities, yet they frequently hallucinate when used as world models (WMs), where strict compliance with deterministic transition rules--particularly in corner cases--is essential. In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy. Extensive experiments on three distinct interactive environments, i.e., ScienceWorld, Webshop, and Plancraft, demonstrate NeSyS's consistent advantages over baselines in both WM prediction accuracy and data efficiency.

### 7. [Triggers Hijack Language Circuits: A Mechanistic Analysis of Backdoor Behaviors in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10382v1)

Authors: Théo Lasnier, Wissam Antoun, Francis Kulumba, Djamé Seddah

Backdoor attacks pose significant security risks for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the internal mechanisms by which triggers operate remain poorly understood. We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7.5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0.18 and 0.66 over the top heads identified. This suggests that backdoor triggers do not form isolated circuits but instead co-opt the model's existing language components. These findings have implications for backdoor defense: detection methods may benefit from monitoring known functional components rather than searching for hidden circuits, and mitigation strategies could potentially leverage this entanglement between injected and natural behaviors.

### 8. [Online Causal Kalman Filtering for Stable and Effective Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10609v1)

Authors: Shuo He, Lang Feng, Xin Cheng, Lei Feng, Bo An

Reinforcement learning for large language models suffers from high-variance token-level importance sampling (IS) ratios, which would destabilize policy optimization at scale. To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates. Experimentally, KPO achieves superior results on challenging math reasoning datasets compared with state-of-the-art counterparts.

### 9. [Data Repetition Beats Data Scaling in Long-CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11149v1)

Authors: Dawid J. Kopiczko, Sagar Vaze, Tijmen Blankevoort, Yuki M. Asano

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data is an essential post-training step for reasoning language models. Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models.

### 10. [Just on Time: Token-Level Early Stopping for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11133v1)

Authors: Zahar Kohut, Severyn Shykula, Dmytro Khamula, Mykola Vysotskyi, Taras Rumezhak, Volodymyr Karpiv

Diffusion language models generate text through iterative refinement, a process that is often computationally inefficient because many tokens reach stability long before the final denoising step. We introduce a training-free, token-level early stopping approach that identifies convergence independently at each position. Our method leverages lightweight signals derived from the model's predictions and local context to dynamically determine when individual tokens can be finalized. This yields adaptive per-token freezing without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the total number of diffusion steps required. Across diverse benchmarks, spanning mathematical reasoning, general question answering, and scientific understanding, our approach achieves state-of-the-art efficiency gains while preserving generation quality.

### 1. [When Skills Lie: Hidden-Comment Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10498v1)

Authors: Qianli Wang, Boyang Ma, Minghui Xu, Yue Zhang

LLM agents often rely on Skills to describe available tools and recommended procedures. We study a hidden-comment prompt injection risk in this documentation layer: when a Markdown Skill is rendered to HTML, HTML comment blocks can become invisible to human reviewers, yet the raw text may still be supplied verbatim to the model. In experiments, we find that DeepSeek-V3.2 and GLM-4.5-Air can be influenced by malicious instructions embedded in a hidden comment appended to an otherwise legitimate Skill, yielding outputs that contain sensitive tool intentions. A short defensive system prompt that treats Skills as untrusted and forbids sensitive actions prevents these malicious tool calls and instead surfaces the suspicious hidden instructions.

### 2. [Protecting Context and Prompts: Deterministic Security for Non-Deterministic AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10481v1)

Authors: Mohan Rajagopalan, Vinay Rao

Large Language Model (LLM) applications are vulnerable to prompt injection and context manipulation attacks that traditional security models cannot prevent. We introduce two novel primitives--authenticated prompts and authenticated context--that provide cryptographically verifiable provenance across LLM workflows. Authenticated prompts enable self-contained lineage verification, while authenticated context uses tamper-evident hash chains to ensure integrity of dynamic inputs. Building on these primitives, we formalize a policy algebra with four proven theorems providing protocol-level Byzantine resistance--even adversarial agents cannot violate organizational policies. Five complementary defenses--from lightweight resource controls to LLM-based semantic validation--deliver layered, preventative security with formal guarantees. Evaluation against representative attacks spanning 6 exhaustive categories achieves 100% detection with zero false positives and nominal overhead. We demonstrate the first approach combining cryptographically enforced prompt lineage, tamper-evident context, and provable policy reasoning--shifting LLM security from reactive detection to preventative guarantees.

Authors: Zihao Li, Hongyi Lu, Yanan Guo, Zhenkai Zhang, Shuai Wang, Fengwei Zhang

GPU memory errors are a critical threat to deep learning (DL) frameworks, leading to crashes or even security issues. We introduce GPU-Fuzz, a fuzzer locating these issues efficiently by modeling operator parameters as formal constraints. GPU-Fuzz utilizes a constraint solver to generate test cases that systematically probe error-prone boundary conditions in GPU kernels. Applied to PyTorch, TensorFlow, and PaddlePaddle, we uncovered 13 unknown bugs, demonstrating the effectiveness of GPU-Fuzz in finding memory errors.

### 4. [SecCodePRM: A Process Reward Model for Code Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10418v1)

Authors: Weichen Yu, Ravi Mangal, Yinyi Luo, Kai Hu, Jingxuan He, Corina S. Pasareanu, Matt Fredrikson

Large Language Models are rapidly becoming core components of modern software development workflows, yet ensuring code security remains challenging. Existing vulnerability detection pipelines either rely on static analyzers or use LLM/GNN-based detectors trained with coarse program-level supervision. Both families often require complete context, provide sparse end-of-completion feedback, and can degrade as code length grows, making them ill-suited for real-time, prefix-level assessment during interactive coding and streaming generation. We propose SecCodePRM, a security-oriented process reward model that assigns a context-aware, step-level security score along a code trajectory. To train the model, we derive step-level supervision labels from static analyzers and expert annotations, allowing the model to attend more precisely to fine-grained regions associated with inter-procedural vulnerabilities. SecCodePRM has three applications: full-code vulnerability detection (VD), partial-code VD, and secure code generation (CG). For VD, SecCodePRM uses risk-sensitive aggregation that emphasizes high-risk steps; for CG, SecCodePRM supports inference-time scaling by ranking candidate continuations and favoring higher cumulative reward. This design yields dense, real-time feedback that scales to long-horizon generation. Empirically, SecCodePRM outperforms prior approaches in all three settings, while preserving code functional correctness, suggesting improved security without a safety-utility tradeoff.

### 5. [Invisible Trails? An Identity Alignment Scheme based on Online Tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10626v1)

Authors: Ruisheng Shi, Zhiyuan Peng, Tong Fu, Lina Lan, Qin Wang, Jiaqi Zeng

Many tracking companies collect user data and sell it to data markets and advertisers. While they claim to protect user privacy by anonymizing the data, our research reveals that significant privacy risks persist even with anonymized data. Attackers can exploit this data to identify users' accounts on other websites and perform targeted identity alignment. In this paper, we propose an effective identity alignment scheme for accurately identifying targeted users. We develop a data collector to obtain the necessary datasets, an algorithm for identity alignment, and, based on this, construct two types of de-anonymization attacks: the \textit{passive attack}, which analyzes tracker data to align identities, and the \textit{active attack}, which induces users to interact online, leading to higher success rates. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, a novel evaluation framework for online tracking-based identity alignment. We investigate the key factors influencing the effectiveness of identity alignment. Additionally, we provide an independent assessment of our generated dataset and present a fully functional system prototype applied to a cryptocurrency use case.

### 6. [Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs in Quantum Information Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10510v1)

Authors: Theshani Nuradha, Sujeet Bhalerao, Felix Leditzky

When sensitive information is encoded in data, it is important to ensure the privacy of information when attempting to learn useful information from the data. There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\varepsilon,δ)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $Θ((\varepsilon β)^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $β$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks.

### 7. [VulReaD: Knowledge-Graph-guided Software Vulnerability Reasoning and Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10787v1)

Authors: Samal Mukhtar, Yinghua Yao, Zhu Sun, Mustafa Mustafa, Yew Soon Ong, Youcheng Sun

Software vulnerability detection (SVD) is a critical challenge in modern systems. Large language models (LLMs) offer natural-language explanations alongside predictions, but most work focuses on binary evaluation, and explanations often lack semantic consistency with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability.

### 8. [Mask-Based Window-Level Insider Threat Detection for Campaign Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11019v1)

Authors: Jericho Cain, Hayden Beadles

User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) systems commonly detect insider threats by scoring fixed time windows of user activity for anomalous behavior. While this window-level paradigm has proven effective for identifying sharp behavioral deviations, it remains unclear how much information about longer-running attack campaigns is already present within individual windows, and how such information can be leveraged for campaign discovery. In this work, we study unsupervised window-level insider threat detection on the CERT r4.2 dataset and show that explicitly separating activity presence from activity magnitude yields substantial performance gains. We introduce a dual-channel convolutional autoencoder that reconstructs both a binary activity mask and corresponding activity values, allowing the model to focus representational capacity on sparse behavioral structure rather than dense inactive baselines. Across multiday attack campaigns lasting between one and seven days, the proposed approach achieves a window-level precision-recall AUC of 0.71, substantially exceeding standard unsupervised autoencoder baselines and enabling high-precision operating points with zero false alarms.

### 9. [Architecting Trust: A Framework for Secure IoT Systems Through Trusted Execution and Semantic Middleware](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10762v1)

Authors: Muhammad Imran

The Internet of Things (IoT) security landscape requires the architectural solutions that can address the technical and operational challenges across the heterogeneous environments. The IoT systems operate in different conditions, and security issues continue to increase. This paper presents the comprehensive security framework for IoT that should integrate the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with the semantic middleware and blockchain technologies. The work provides a systematic analysis of the architectural patterns based on more than twenty recent research works and the existing standards, and it proposes a layered security architecture. The architecture includes the hardware rooted trust at peripheral level, the zero trust principles at network level, and the semantic security mechanisms at application level. The framework focuses on practical implementation aspects such as the performance overhead, interoperability requirements, and the compliance with new regulations, which are very important for the real IoT deployments. The paper reports quantitative metrics which include the cryptographic performance on Cortex-M class microcontrollers with the detection accuracy rates and the energy consumption values. The proposed architecture shows that cross-layer security integration can provide defense in depth while it still satisfies the constraints of resource-limited IoT environments. The discussion highlights open challenges and the future research directions for the IoT security architectures that include the post-quantum migration, secure federated model exchange and the automated compliance verification.

### 10. [VideoSTF: Stress-Testing Output Repetition in Video Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10639v1)

Authors: Yuxin Cao, Wei Song, Shangzhi Xu, Jingling Xue, Jin Song Dong

Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at: https://github.com/yuxincao22/VideoSTF_benchmark.

### Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

### 1. [Enhancing Predictability of Multi-Tenant DNN Inference for Autonomous Vehicles' Perception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11004v1)

Authors: Liangkai Liu, Kang G. Shin, Jinkyu Lee, Chengmo Yang, Weisong Shi

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.

### 2. [DFIC: Towards a balanced facial image dataset for automatic ICAO compliance verification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10985v1)

Authors: Nuno Gonçalves, Diogo Nunes, Carla Guerra, João Marcos

Ensuring compliance with ISO/IEC and ICAO standards for facial images in machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs) is essential for reliable identity verification, but current manual inspection methods are inefficient in high-demand environments. This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.
  Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems.

### 3. [VFGS-Net: Frequency-Guided State-Space Learning for Topology-Preserving Retinal Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10978v1)

Authors: Ruiqi Song, Lei Liu, Ya-Nan Zhang, Chao Wang, Xiaoning Li, Nan Mu

Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential.

Authors: Martin Gromniak, Jan-Gerrit Habekost, Sebastian Kamp, Sven Magg, Stefan Wermter

We introduce a Generalizable Neural Radiance Field approach for predicting 3D workspace occupancy from egocentric robot observations. Unlike prior methods operating in camera-centric coordinates, our model constructs occupancy representations in a global workspace frame, making it directly applicable to robotic manipulation. The model integrates flexible source views and generalizes to unseen object arrangements without scene-specific finetuning. We demonstrate the approach on a humanoid robot and evaluate predicted geometry against 3D sensor ground truth. Trained on 40 real scenes, our model achieves 26mm reconstruction error, including occluded regions, validating its ability to infer complete 3D occupancy beyond traditional stereo vision methods.

### 5. [FastUSP: A Multi-Level Collaborative Acceleration Framework for Distributed Diffusion Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10940v1)

Authors: Guandong Li

Large-scale diffusion models such as FLUX (12B parameters) and Stable Diffusion 3 (8B parameters) require multi-GPU parallelism for efficient inference. Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \textbf{1.12$\times$--1.16$\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \textbf{1.09$\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\times$--1.46$\times$ of 2-GPU performance. We further provide a detailed analysis of the performance characteristics of distributed diffusion inference, revealing that kernel launch overhead -- rather than communication latency -- is the primary bottleneck on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects.

### 6. [Viewpoint Recommendation for Point Cloud Labeling through Interaction Cost Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10871v1)

Authors: Yu Zhang, Xinyi Zhao, Chongke Bi, Siming Chen

Semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds is important for many applications, such as autonomous driving. To train semantic segmentation models, labeled point cloud segmentation datasets are essential. Meanwhile, point cloud labeling is time-consuming for annotators, which typically involves tuning the camera viewpoint and selecting points by lasso. To reduce the time cost of point cloud labeling, we propose a viewpoint recommendation approach to reduce annotators' labeling time costs. We adapt Fitts' law to model the time cost of lasso selection in point clouds. Using the modeled time cost, the viewpoint that minimizes the lasso selection time cost is recommended to the annotator. We build a data labeling system for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds that integrates our viewpoint recommendation approach. The system enables users to navigate to recommended viewpoints for efficient annotation. Through an ablation study, we observed that our approach effectively reduced the data labeling time cost. We also qualitatively compare our approach with previous viewpoint selection approaches on different datasets.

### 7. [Resource-Efficient RGB-Only Action Recognition for Edge Deployment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10818v1)

Authors: Dongsik Yoon, Jongeun Kim, Dayeon Lee

Action recognition on edge devices poses stringent constraints on latency, memory, storage, and power consumption. While auxiliary modalities such as skeleton and depth information can enhance recognition performance, they often require additional sensors or computationally expensive pose-estimation pipelines, limiting practicality for edge use. In this work, we propose a compact RGB-only network tailored for efficient on-device inference. Our approach builds upon an X3D-style backbone augmented with Temporal Shift, and further introduces selective temporal adaptation and parameter-free attention. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 benchmarks demonstrate a strong accuracy-efficiency balance. Moreover, deployment-level profiling on the Jetson Orin Nano verifies a smaller on-device footprint and practical resource utilization compared to existing RGB-based action recognition techniques.

### 8. [DMP-3DAD: Cross-Category 3D Anomaly Detection via Realistic Depth Map Projection with Few Normal Samples](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10806v1)

Authors: Zi Wang, Katsuya Hotta, Koichiro Kamide, Yawen Zou, Jianjian Qin, Chao Zhang, Jun Yu

Cross-category anomaly detection for 3D point clouds aims to determine whether an unseen object belongs to a target category using only a few normal examples. Most existing methods rely on category-specific training, which limits their flexibility in few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose DMP-3DAD, a training-free framework for cross-category 3D anomaly detection based on multi-view realistic depth map projection. Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNetPart dataset demonstrate that DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot setting. The results show that the proposed approach provides a simple yet effective solution for practical cross-category 3D anomaly detection.

### 9. [RSHallu: Dual-Mode Hallucination Evaluation for Remote-Sensing Multimodal Large Language Models with Domain-Tailored Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10799v1)

Authors: Zihui Zhou, Yong Feng, Yanying Chen, Guofan Duan, Zhenxi Song, Mingliang Zhou, Weijia Jia

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly adopted in remote sensing (RS) and have shown strong performance on tasks such as RS visual grounding (RSVG), RS visual question answering (RSVQA), and multimodal dialogue. However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG). Code and datasets will be released.

### 10. [The Garbage Dataset (GD): A Multi-Class Image Benchmark for Automated Waste Segregation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10500v1)

Authors: Suman Kunwar

This study introduces the Garbage Dataset (GD), a publicly available image dataset designed to advance automated waste segregation through machine learning and computer vision. It's a diverse dataset covering 10 common household waste categories: metal, glass, biological, paper, battery, trash, cardboard, shoes, clothes, and plastic. The dataset comprises 13,348 labeled images collected through multiple methods, including DWaste mobile app and curated web sources. Methods included rigorous validation through checksums and outlier detection, analysis of class imbalance and visual separability via PCA/t-SNE, and assessment of background complexity using entropy and saliency measures. The dataset was benchmarked using state-of-the-art deep learning models (EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2S, MobileNet, ResNet50, ResNet101) evaluated on performance metrics and operational carbon emissions. Experiment results indicate EfficientNetV2S achieved the highest performance with 96.19% accuracy and a 0.96 F1-score, though with a moderate carbon cost. Analysis revealed inherent dataset characteristics including class imbalance, a skew toward high-outlier classes (plastic, cardboard, paper), and brightness variations that require consideration. The main conclusion is that GD provides a valuable, real-world benchmark for waste classification research while highlighting important challenges such as class imbalance, background complexity, and environmental trade-offs in model selection that must be addressed for practical deployment. The dataset is publicly released to support further research in environmental sustainability applications.

### 1. [Drawing Your Programs: Exploring the Applications of Visual-Prompting with GenAI for Teaching and Assessment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10529v1)

Authors: David H. Smith, S. Moonwara A. Monisha, Annapurna Vadaparty, Leo Porter, Daniel Zingaro

When designing a program, both novice programmers and seasoned developers alike often sketch out -- or, perhaps more famously, whiteboard -- their ideas. Yet despite the introduction of natively multimodal Generative AI models, work on Human-GenAI collaborative coding has remained overwhelmingly focused on textual prompts -- largely ignoring the visual and spatial representations that programmers naturally use to reason about and communicate their designs. In this proposal and position paper, we argue and provide tentative evidence that this text-centric focus overlooks other forms of prompting GenAI models, such as problem decomposition diagrams functioning as prompts for code generation in their own right enabling new types of programming activities and assessments. To support this position, we present findings from a large introductory Python programming course, where students constructed decomposition diagrams that were used to prompt GPT-4.1 for code generation. We demonstrate that current models are very successful in their ability to generate code from student-constructed diagrams. We conclude by exploring the implications of embracing multimodal prompting for computing education, particularly in the context of assessment.

### 2. [A Human-Centric Framework for Data Attribution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10995v1)

Authors: Amelie Wührl, Mattes Ruckdeschel, Kyle Lo, Anna Rogers

In the current Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem, creators have little agency over how their data is used, and LLM users may find themselves unknowingly plagiarizing existing sources. Attribution of LLM-generated text to LLM input data could help with these challenges, but so far we have more questions than answers: what elements of LLM outputs require attribution, what goals should it serve, how should it be implemented?
  We contribute a human-centric data attribution framework, which situates the attribution problem within the broader data economy. Specific use cases for attribution, such as creative writing assistance or fact-checking, can be specified via a set of parameters (including stakeholder objectives and implementation criteria). These criteria are up for negotiation by the relevant stakeholder groups: creators, LLM users, and their intermediaries (publishers, platforms, AI companies). The outcome of domain-specific negotiations can be implemented and tested for whether the stakeholder goals are achieved. The proposed approach provides a bridge between methodological NLP work on data attribution, governance work on policy interventions, and economic analysis of creator incentives for a sustainable equilibrium in the data economy.

### 3. [Computational Phenomenology of Temporal Experience in Autism: Quantifying the Emotional and Narrative Characteristics of Lived Unpredictability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10947v1)

Authors: Kacper Dudzic, Karolina Drożdż, Maciej Wodziński, Anastazja Szuła, Marcin Moskalewicz

Disturbances in temporality, such as desynchronization with the social environment and its unpredictability, are considered core features of autism with a deep impact on relationships. However, limitations regarding research on this issue include: 1) the dominance of deficit-based medical models of autism, 2) sample size in qualitative research, and 3) the lack of phenomenological anchoring in computational research. To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the "Immediacy & Suddenness" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction.

### 4. [Traceable, Enforceable, and Compensable Participation: A Participation Ledger for People-Centered AI Governance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10916v1)

Authors: Rashid Mushkani

Participatory approaches are widely invoked in AI governance, yet participation rarely translates into durable influence. In public sector and civic AI systems, community contributions such as deliberations, annotations, prompts, and incident reports are often recorded informally, weakly linked to system updates, and disconnected from enforceable rights or sustained compensation. As a result, participation is frequently symbolic rather than accountable. We introduce the Participation Ledger, a machine readable and auditable framework that operationalizes participation as traceable influence, enforceable authority, and compensable labor. The ledger represents participation as an influence graph that links contributed artifacts to verified changes in AI systems, including datasets, prompts, adapters, policies, guardrails, and evaluation suites. It integrates three elements: a Participation Evidence Standard documenting consent, privacy, compensation, and reuse terms; an influence tracing mechanism that connects system updates to replayable before and after tests, enabling longitudinal monitoring of commitments; and encoded rights and incentives. Capability Vouchers allow authorized community stewards to request or constrain specific system capabilities within defined boundaries, while Participation Credits support ongoing recognition and compensation when contributed tests continue to provide value. We ground the framework in four urban AI and public space governance deployments and provide a machine readable schema, templates, and an evaluation plan for assessing traceability, enforceability, and compensation in practice.

### 5. [Llama-Polya: Instruction Tuning for Large Language Model based on Polya's Problem-solving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10597v1)

Authors: Unggi Lee, Yeil Jeong, Chohui Lee, Gyuri Byun, Yunseo Lee, Minji Kang, Minji Jeon

This paper introduces Llama-Polya, an instruction-tuned large language model that integrates Polya's four-step problem-solving framework into its dialogue structure to support mathematical reasoning. Mathematical problem-solving is central to students' success in mathematics education, yet many learners struggle to plan, justify, and verify their solutions. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise as intelligent tutors, they often lack structured pedagogical alignment grounded in established learning theories.
  To address this gap, we operationalize Polya's problem-solving framework within an instruction-tuned LLM to promote metacognitive engagement and examine the effects of pedagogy-aligned fine-tuning compared to domain-only and general-purpose instruction tuning. Built on the Llama-3.1-8B architecture, Llama-Polya was fine-tuned on synthetic math problem-solving data derived from GSM8K, structured according to Polya's four stages. We developed and evaluated multiple variants-general-purpose instruct, math-domain metamath, pedagogy-aligned polya-v2, and sequential metamath+polya-v2-using both quantitative accuracy metrics and qualitative pedagogical assessments.
  Results indicate that models tuned with Polya's framework and domain-specific data produced more balanced reasoning-stage distributions and fewer premature answers. Expert evaluators also observed improved pedagogical coherence and metacognitive prompting, although limitations in personalization and mathematical rigor remained. These findings suggest that pedagogy-grounded instruction tuning can enhance educational alignment and reasoning transparency in LLM-based tutoring systems.

### 6. [MetaphorStar: Image Metaphor Understanding and Reasoning with End-to-End Visual Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10575v1)

Authors: Chenhao Zhang, Yazhe Niu, Hongsheng Li

Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for Nowadays AI systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.
  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method. We open-sourced all model weights, datasets, and method code at https://metaphorstar.github.io.

Authors: Scott P. McGrath, Katherine K. Kim, Karnjit Johl, Haibo Wang, Nick Anderson

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare is accelerating, yet medical education has not kept pace with these technological advancements. This paper synthesizes current knowledge on AI in medical education through a comprehensive analysis of the literature, identifying key competencies, curricular approaches, and implementation strategies. The aim is highlighting the critical need for structured AI education across the medical learning continuum and offer a framework for curriculum development. The findings presented suggest that effective AI education requires longitudinal integration throughout medical training, interdisciplinary collaboration, and balanced attention to both technical fundamentals and clinical applications. This paper serves as a foundation for medical educators seeking to prepare future physicians for an AI-enhanced healthcare environment.

Authors: Mickey M. Rogers, William M. Ota, Nathaniel Burola, Tepring Piquado

The rapid growth of data centers driven by cloud computing and artificial intelligence is reshaping infrastructure planning and environmental governance in the United States. Georgia has emerged as a major market for data center development, particularly in the Atlanta metropolitan region, creating economic opportunity alongside significant challenges. Data centers are water-intensive, energy-intensive, and land-intensive infrastructure whose cumulative impacts strain municipal water systems, electric grids, and local land-use frameworks. Unlike single industrial projects, data centers are often proposed in clusters, amplifying community and infrastructure impacts.
  This report draws on insights from a Georgia-based expert convening to describe the implications of data center growth for water management, energy reliability, ratepayer equity, zoning, and community engagement, identify potential gaps in transparency and regulatory coordination, and present a policy roadmap to help Georgia balance digital infrastructure growth with sustainability, equity, and community protection.

### 9. [The State's Politics of "Fake Data"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10944v1)

Authors: Chuncheng Liu, Danah Boyd

Data have power. As such, most discussions of data presume that records should mirror some idealized ground truth. Deviations are viewed as failure. Drawing on two ethnographic studies of state data-making in a Chinese street-level bureaucrat agency and at the US Census Bureau we show how seemingly "fake" state data perform institutional work. We map four moments in which actors negotiate between representational accuracy and organizational imperatives: creation, correction, collusion, and augmentation. Bureaucrats routinely privilege what data do over what they represent, creating fictions that serve civil servants' self-interest and enable constrained administrations. We argue that "fakeness" of state data is relational (context dependent), processual (emerging through workflows), and performative (brought into being through labeling and practice). We urge practitioners to center fitness-for-purpose in assessments of data and contextual governance. Rather than chasing impossible representational accuracy, sociotechnical systems should render the politics of useful fictions visible, contestable, and accountable.

Authors: Vasilii Starikov, Ruslan Kozliak, Georgii Kontsevik, Sergey Mityagin

Accurate reconstruction of missing morphological indicators of a city is crucial for urban planning and data-driven analysis. This study presents the spatial-morphological (SM) imputer tool, which combines data-driven morphological clustering with neighborhood-based methods to reconstruct missing values of the floor space index (FSI) and ground space index (GSI) at the city block level, inspired by the SpaceMatrix framework. This approach combines city-scale morphological patterns as global priors with local spatial information for context-dependent interpolation. The evaluation shows that while SM alone captures meaningful morphological structure, its combination with inverse distance weighting (IDW) or spatial k-nearest neighbor (sKNN) methods provides superior performance compared to existing SOTA models. Composite methods demonstrate the complementary advantages of combining morphological and spatial approaches.

### 1. [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Validation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10748v1)

Authors: Farzad Shami, Stefano Marchesin, Gianmaria Silvello

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) store structured factual knowledge by linking entities through relationships, crucial for many applications. These applications depend on the KG's factual accuracy, so verifying facts is essential, yet challenging. Expert manual verification is ideal but impractical on a large scale. Automated methods show promise but are not ready for real-world KGs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential with their semantic understanding and knowledge access, yet their suitability and effectiveness for KG fact validation remain largely unexplored.
  In this paper, we introduce FactCheck, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs for KG fact validation across three key dimensions: (1) LLMs internal knowledge; (2) external evidence via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); and (3) aggregated knowledge employing a multi-model consensus strategy. We evaluated open-source and commercial LLMs on three diverse real-world KGs. FactCheck also includes a RAG dataset with 2+ million documents tailored for KG fact validation. Additionally, we offer an interactive exploration platform for analyzing verification decisions.
  The experimental analyses demonstrate that while LLMs yield promising results, they are still not sufficiently stable and reliable to be used in real-world KG validation scenarios. Integrating external evidence through RAG methods yields fluctuating performance, providing inconsistent improvements over more streamlined approaches -- at higher computational costs. Similarly, strategies based on multi-model consensus do not consistently outperform individual models, underscoring the lack of a one-fits-all solution. These findings further emphasize the need for a benchmark like FactCheck to systematically evaluate and drive progress on this difficult yet crucial task.

### 2. [An Ontology-driven Dynamic Knowledge Base for Uninhabited Ground Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10555v1)

Authors: Hsan Sandar Win, Andrew Walters, Cheng-Chew Lim, Daniel Webber, Seth Leslie, Tan Doan

In this paper, the concept of Dynamic Contextual Mission Data (DCMD) is introduced to develop an ontology-driven dynamic knowledge base for Uninhabited Ground Vehicles (UGVs) at the tactical edge. The dynamic knowledge base with DCMD is added to the UGVs to: support enhanced situation awareness; improve autonomous decision making; and facilitate agility within complex and dynamic environments. As UGVs are heavily reliant on the a priori information added pre-mission, unexpected occurrences during a mission can cause identification ambiguities and require increased levels of user input. Updating this a priori information with contextual information can help UGVs realise their full potential. To address this, the dynamic knowledge base was designed using an ontology-driven representation, supported by near real-time information acquisition and analysis, to provide in-mission on-platform DCMD updates. This was implemented on a team of four UGVs that executed a laboratory based surveillance mission. The results showed that the ontology-driven dynamic representation of the UGV operational environment was machine actionable, producing contextual information to support a successful and timely mission, and contributed directly to the situation awareness.

Authors: Maciej Besta, Łukasz Jarmocik, Orest Hrycyna, Shachar Klaiman, Konrad Mączka, Robert Gerstenberger, Jürgen Müller, Piotr Nyczyk, Hubert Niewiadomski, Torsten Hoefler

Graphs are foundational across domains but remain hard to use without deep expertise. LLMs promise accessible natural language (NL) graph analytics, yet they fail to process industry-scale property graphs effectively and efficiently: such datasets are large, highly heterogeneous, structurally complex, and evolve dynamically. To address this, we devise a novel abstraction for complex multi-query analytics over such graphs. Its key idea is to replace brittle generation of graph queries directly from NL with planning over a Semantic Catalog that describes both the graph schema and the graph operations. Concretely, this induces a clean separation between a Semantic Plane for LLM planning and broader reasoning, and an Execution Plane for deterministic, database-grade query execution over the full dataset and tool implementations. This design yields substantial gains in both token efficiency and task effectiveness even with small-context LLMs. We use this abstraction as the basis of the first LLM-enhanced graph analytics framework called GraphSeek. GraphSeek achieves substantially higher success rates (e.g., 86% over enhanced LangChain) and points toward the next generation of affordable and accessible graph analytics that unify LLM reasoning with database-grade execution over large and complex property graphs.

### 4. [Making Databases Faster with LLM Evolutionary Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10387v1)

Authors: Mehmet Hamza Erol, Xiangpeng Hao, Federico Bianchi, Ciro Greco, Jacopo Tagliabue, James Zou

Traditional query optimization relies on cost-based optimizers that estimate execution cost (e.g., runtime, memory, and I/O) using predefined heuristics and statistical models. Improving these heuristics requires substantial engineering effort, and even when implemented, these heuristics often cannot take into account semantic correlations in queries and schemas that could enable better physical plans. Using our DBPlanBench harness for the DataFusion engine, we expose the physical plan through a compact serialized representation and let the LLM propose localized edits that can be applied and executed. We then apply an evolutionary search over these edits to refine candidates across iterations. Our key insight is that LLMs can leverage semantic knowledge to identify and apply non-obvious optimizations, such as join orderings that minimize intermediate cardinalities. We obtain up to 4.78$\times$ speedups on some queries and we demonstrate a small-to-large workflow in which optimizations found on small databases transfer effectively to larger databases.

Authors: Youhe Jiang, Fangcheng Fu, Eiko Yoneki

The rapid growth of large language model (LLM) deployments has made cost-efficient serving systems essential. Recent efforts to enhance system cost-efficiency adopt two main perspectives: (i) An algorithmic perspective that exploits heterogeneous model capabilities to route simpler queries to lower-cost models and complex queries to higher-cost models (i.e., heterogeneous query routing); and (ii) a systems perspective that utilizes heterogeneous GPU resources as cost-effective alternatives to homogeneous high-end GPUs (i.e., heterogeneous model deployment). However, algorithm-system co-design for cost-efficient LLM serving necessitates sophisticated management: (i) Determining optimal query routing strategies under latency and quality requirements, (ii) configuring model deployment across heterogeneous GPUs with appropriate resource allocation and parallelism strategies, and (iii) co-optimizing routing and deployment decisions to maximize overall system performance. To address these challenges, we present BOute, a quality-aware scheduling system that jointly exploits heterogeneous model and GPU capabilities for cost-efficient LLM serving. BOute employs a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to co-optimize the routing strategy and model deployment, thereby maximizing the cost-efficiency of the serving system while guaranteeing response quality. Evaluation results demonstrate that BOute outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving systems by up to 157% and 59% on average under identical cost budgets and quality requirements, or reducing serving costs by 15%-61% (38% on average) while maintaining the same performance targets, validating its effectiveness in achieving cost-efficient LLM serving.

### 2. [Min-Sum Uniform Coverage Problem by Autonomous Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11125v1)

Authors: Animesh Maiti, Abhinav Chakraborty, Bibhuti Das, Subhash Bhagat, Krishnendu Mukhopadhyaya

We study the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem for a swarm of $n$ mobile robots on a given finite line segment and on a circle having finite positive radius, where the circle is given as an input. The robots must coordinate their movements to reach a uniformly spaced configuration that minimizes the total distance traveled by all robots. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, identical, and homogeneous, and operate under the \textit{Look-Compute-Move} (LCM) model with \textit{non-rigid} motion controlled by a fair asynchronous scheduler. They are oblivious and silent, possessing neither persistent memory nor a means of explicit communication. In the \textbf{line-segment setting}, the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem requires placing the robots at uniformly spaced points along the segment so as to minimize the total distance traveled by all robots. In the \textbf{circle setting} for this problem, the robots have to arrange themselves uniformly around the given circle to form a regular $n$-gon. There is no fixed orientation or designated starting vertex, and the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots. We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage in the line-segment setting with minimum total movement cost. For the circle setting, we characterize all initial configurations for which the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem is deterministically unsolvable under the considered robot model. For all the other remaining configurations, we provide a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage while minimizing the total distance traveled. These results characterize the deterministic solvability of min-sum coverage for oblivious robots and achieve optimal cost whenever solvable.

Developing efficient GPU kernels is essential for scaling modern AI systems, yet it remains a complex task due to intricate hardware architectures and the need for specialized optimization expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x. Our work demonstrates that targeted post-training with reinforcement learning can unlock LLM capabilities in highly specialized technical domains where traditional supervised learning is limited by data availability, opening new pathways for AI-assisted accelerator programming.

### 4. [Computing Least Fixed Points with Overwrite Semantics in Parallel and Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10486v1)

Authors: Vijay K. Garg, Rohan Garg

We present methods to compute least fixed points of multiple monotone inflationary functions in parallel and distributed settings. While the classic Knaster-Tarski theorem addresses a single function with sequential iteration, modern computing systems require parallel execution with overwrite semantics, non-atomic updates, and stale reads. We prove three convergence theorems under progressively relaxed synchronization: (1) Interleaving semantics with fair scheduling, (2) Parallel execution with update-only-on-change semantics (processes write only on those coordinates whose values change), and (3) Distributed execution with bounded staleness (updates propagate within $T$ rounds) and $i$-locality (each process modifies only its own component).
  Our approach differs from prior work in fundamental ways: Cousot-Cousot's chaotic iteration uses join-based merges that preserve information. Instead, we use coordinate-wise overwriting. Bertsekas's asynchronous methods assume contractions. We use coordinate-wise overwriting with structural constraints (locality, bounded staleness) instead. Applications include parallel and distributed algorithms for the transitive closure, stable marriage, shortest paths, and fair division with subsidy problems. Our results provide the first exact least-fixed-point convergence guarantees for overwrite-based parallel updates without join operations or contraction assumptions.

### 5. [Authenticated Workflows: A Systems Approach to Protecting Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10465v1)

Authors: Mohan Rajagopalan, Vinay Rao

Agentic AI systems automate enterprise workflows but existing defenses--guardrails, semantic filters--are probabilistic and routinely bypassed. We introduce authenticated workflows, the first complete trust layer for enterprise agentic AI. Security reduces to protecting four fundamental boundaries: prompts, tools, data, and context. We enforce intent (operations satisfy organizational policies) and integrity (operations are cryptographically authentic) at every boundary crossing, combining cryptographic elimination of attack classes with runtime policy enforcement. This delivers deterministic security--operations either carry valid cryptographic proof or are rejected. We introduce MAPL, an AI-native policy language that expresses agentic constraints dynamically as agents evolve and invocation context changes, scaling as O(log M + N) policies versus O(M x N) rules through hierarchical composition with cryptographic attestations for workflow dependencies. We prove practicality through a universal security runtime integrating nine leading frameworks (MCP, A2A, OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Haystack) through thin adapters requiring zero protocol modifications. Formal proofs establish completeness and soundness. Empirical validation shows 100% recall with zero false positives across 174 test cases, protection against 9 of 10 OWASP Top 10 risks, and complete mitigation of two high impact production CVEs.

### 6. [Chamfer-Linkage for Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10444v1)

Authors: Kishen N Gowda, Willem Fletcher, MohammadHossein Bateni, Laxman Dhulipala, D Ellis Hershkowitz, Rajesh Jayaram, Jakub Łącki

Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is a widely-used clustering method based on repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters, where inter-cluster distances are determined by a linkage function. Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.
  In this paper, we propose \emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice.

### 1. [Implicit representations via the polynomial method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10922v1)

Authors: Jean Cardinal, Micha Sharir

Semialgebraic graphs are graphs whose vertices are points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and adjacency between two vertices is determined by the truth value of a semialgebraic predicate of constant complexity. We show how to harness polynomial partitioning methods to construct compact adjacency labeling schemes for families of semialgebraic graphs.
  That is, we show that for any family of semialgebraic graphs, given a graph on $n$ vertices in this family, we can assign a label consisting of $O(n^{1-2/(d+1) + \varepsilon})$ bits to each vertex (where $\varepsilon > 0$ can be made arbitrarily small and the constant of proportionality depends on $\varepsilon$ and on the complexity of the adjacency-defining predicate), such that adjacency between two vertices can be determined solely from their two labels, without any additional information. We obtain for instance that unit disk graphs and segment intersection graphs have such labelings with labels of $O(n^{1/3 + \varepsilon})$ bits. This is in contrast to their natural implicit representation consisting of the coordinates of the disk centers or segment endpoints, which sometimes require exponentially many bits. It also improves on the best known bound of $O(n^{1-1/d}\log n)$ for $d$-dimensional semialgebraic families due to Alon (Discrete Comput. Geom., 2024), a bound that holds more generally for graphs with shattering functions bounded by a degree-$d$ polynomial.
  We also give new bounds on the size of adjacency labels for other families of graphs. In particular, we consider semilinear graphs, which are semialgebraic graphs in which the predicate only involves linear polynomials. We show that semilinear graphs have adjacency labels of size $O(\log n)$. We also prove that polygon visibility graphs, which are not semialgebraic in the above sense, have adjacency labels of size $O(\log^3 n)$.

### 1. [Better Diameter Bounds for Efficient Shortcuts and a Structural Criterion for Constructiveness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10747v1)

Authors: Bernhard Haeupler, Antti Roeyskoe, Zhijun Zhang

All parallel algorithms for directed connectivity and shortest paths crucially rely on efficient shortcut constructions that add a linear number of transitive closure edges to a given DAG to reduce its diameter. A long sequence of works has studied both (efficient) shortcut constructions and impossibility results on the best diameter and therefore the best parallelism that can be achieved with this approach.
  This paper introduces a new conceptual and technical tool, called certified shortcuts, for this line of research in the form of a simple and natural structural criterion that holds for any shortcut constructed by an efficient (combinatorial) algorithm. It allows us to drastically simplify and strengthen existing impossibility results by proving that any near-linear-time shortcut-based algorithm cannot reduce a graph's diameter below $n^{1/4-o(1)}$. This greatly improves over the $n^{2/9-o(1)}$ lower bound of [HXX25] and seems to be the best bound one can hope for with current techniques.
  Our structural criterion also precisely captures the constructiveness of all known shortcut constructions: we show that existing constructions satisfy the criterion if and only if they have known efficient algorithms. We believe our new criterion and perspective of looking for certified shortcuts can provide crucial guidance for designing efficient shortcut constructions in the future.

### 2. [Personalized PageRank Estimation in Undirected Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10843v1)

Authors: Christian Bertram, Mads Vestergaard Jensen

Given an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, the Personalized PageRank (PPR) of $t\in V$ with respect to $s\in V$, denoted $π(s,t)$, is the probability that an $α$-discounted random walk starting at $s$ terminates at $t$. We study the time complexity of estimating $π(s,t)$ with constant relative error and constant failure probability, whenever $π(s,t)$ is above a given threshold parameter $δ\in(0,1)$. We consider common graph-access models and furthermore study the single source, single target, and single node (PageRank centrality) variants of the problem.
  We provide a complete characterization of PPR estimation in undirected graphs by giving tight bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for all problems and model variants in both the worst-case and average-case setting. This includes both new upper and lower bounds.
  Tight bounds were recently obtained by Bertram, Jensen, Thorup, Wang, and Yan for directed graphs. However, their lower bound constructions rely on asymmetry and therefore do not carry over to undirected graphs. At the same time, undirected graphs exhibit additional structure that can be exploited algorithmically. Our results resolve the undirected case by developing new techniques that capture both aspects, yielding tight bounds.

### 3. [Bounding the Average Move Structure Query for Faster and Smaller RLBWT Permutations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11029v1)

Authors: Nathaniel K. Brown, Ben Langmead

The move structure represents permutations with long contiguously permuted intervals in compressed space with optimal query time. They have become an important feature of compressed text indexes using space proportional to the number of Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) runs, often applied in genomics. This is in thanks not only to theoretical improvements over past approaches, but great cache efficiency and average case query time in practice. This is true even without using the worst case guarantees provided by the interval splitting balancing of the original result. In this paper, we show that an even simpler type of splitting, length capping by truncating long intervals, bounds the average move structure query time to optimal whilst obtaining a superior construction time than the traditional approach. This also proves constant query time when amortized over a full traversal of a single cycle permutation from an arbitrary starting position.
  Such a scheme has surprising benefits both in theory and practice. We leverage the approach to improve the representation of any move structure with $r$ runs over a domain $n$ to $O(r \log r + r \log \frac{n}{r})$-bits of space. The worst case query time is also improved to $O(\log \frac{n}{r})$ without balancing. An $O(r)$-time and $O(r)$-space construction lets us apply the method to run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) permutations such as LF and $φ$ to obtain optimal-time algorithms for BWT inversion and suffix array (SA) enumeration in $O(r)$ additional working space. Finally, we provide the RunPerm library, providing flexible plug and play move structure support, and use it to evaluate our splitting approach. Experiments find length capping results in faster move structures, but also a space reduction: at least $\sim 40\%$ for LF across large repetitive genomic collections.

### 4. [Data Reductions for the Strong Maximum Independent Set Problem in Hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10781v1)

Authors: Ernestine Großmann, Christian Schulz, Darren Strash, Antonie Wagner

This work addresses the well-known Maximum Independent Set problem in the context of hypergraphs. While this problem has been extensively studied on graphs, we focus on its strong extension to hypergraphs, where edges may connect any number of vertices. A set of vertices in a hypergraph is strongly independent if there is at most one vertex per edge in the set. One application for this problem is to find perfect minimal hash functions. We propose nine new data reduction rules specifically designed for this problem. Our reduction routine can serve as a preprocessing step for any solver. We analyze the impact on the size of the reduced instances and the performance of several subsequent solvers when combined with this preprocessing. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in instance size and improvements in running time for subsequent solvers. The preprocessing routine reduces instances, on average, to 22% of their original size in 6.76 seconds. When combining our reduction preprocessing with the best-performing exact solver, we observe an average speedup of 3.84x over not using the reduction rules. In some cases, we can achieve speedups of up to 53x. Additionally, one more instance becomes solvable by a method when combined with our preprocessing.

Authors: Palash Dey, Anubhav Dhar, Ashlesha Hota, Sudeshna Kolay, Aritra Mitra

In this paper, we study the Maximum Common Vertex Subgraph problem: Given two input graphs $G_1,G_2$ and a non-negative integer $h$, is there a common subgraph $H$ on at least $h$ vertices such that there is no isolated vertex in $H$. In other words, each connected component of $H$ has at least $2$ vertices. This problem naturally arises in graph theory along with other variants of the well-studied Maximum Common Subgraph problem and also has applications in computational social choice. We show that this problem is NP-hard and provide an FPT algorithm when parameterized by $h$. Next, we conduct a study of the problem on common structural parameters like vertex cover number, maximum degree, treedepth, pathwidth and treewidth of one or both input graphs. We derive a complete dichotomy of parameterized results for our problem with respect to individual parameterizations as well as combinations of parameterizations from the above structural parameters. This provides us with a deep insight into the complexity theoretic and parameterized landscape of this problem.

Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is a widely-used clustering method based on repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters, where inter-cluster distances are determined by a linkage function. Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.
  In this paper, we propose \emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice.

### 9. [Random Access in Grammar-Compressed Strings: Optimal Trade-Offs in Almost All Parameter Regimes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10864v1)

Authors: Anouk Duyster, Tomasz Kociumaka

A Random Access query to a string $T\in [0..σ)^n$ asks for the character $T[i]$ at a given position $i\in [0..n)$. In $O(n\logσ)$ bits of space, this fundamental task admits constant-time queries. While this is optimal in the worst case, much research has focused on compressible strings, hoping for smaller data structures that still admit efficient queries.
  We investigate the grammar-compressed setting, where $T$ is represented by a straight-line grammar. Our main result is a general trade-off that optimizes Random Access time as a function of string length $n$, grammar size (the total length of productions) $g$, alphabet size $σ$, data structure size $M$, and word size $w=Ω(\log n)$ of the word RAM model. For any $M$ with $g\log n<Mw<n\logσ$, we show an $O(M)$-size data structure with query time $O(\frac{\log(n\logσ\,/\,Mw)}{\log(Mw\,/\,g\log n)})$. Remarkably, we also prove a matching unconditional lower bound that holds for all parameter regimes except very small grammars and relatively small data structures.
  Previous work focused on query time as a function of $n$ only, achieving $O(\log n)$ time using $O(g)$ space [Bille et al.; SIAM J. Comput. 2015] and $O(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$ time using $O(g\log^ε n)$ space for any constant $ε> 0$ [Belazzougui et al.; ESA'15], [Ganardi, Jeż, Lohrey; J. ACM 2021]. The only tight lower bound [Verbin and Yu; CPM'13] was $Ω(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ for $w=Θ(\log n)$, $n^{Ω(1)}\le g\le n^{1-Ω(1)}$, and $M=g\log^{Θ(1)}n$. In contrast, our result yields tight bounds in all relevant parameters and almost all regimes.
  Our data structure admits efficient deterministic construction. It relies on novel grammar transformations that generalize contracting grammars [Ganardi; ESA'21]. Beyond Random Access, its variants support substring extraction, rank, and select.

### 10. [Near-Feasible Stable Matchings: Incentives and Optimality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10851v1)

Authors: Frederik Glitzner

Stable matching is a fundamental area with many practical applications, such as centralised clearinghouses for school choice or job markets. Recent work has introduced the paradigm of near-feasibility in capacitated matching settings, where agent capacities are slightly modified to ensure the existence of desirable outcomes. While useful when no stable matching exists, or some agents are left unmatched, it has not previously been investigated whether near-feasible stable matchings satisfy desirable properties with regard to their stability in the original instance. Furthermore, prior works often leave open deviation incentive issues that arise when the centralised authority modifies agents' capacities.
  We consider these issues in the Stable Fixtures problem model, which generalises many classical models through non-bipartite preferences and capacitated agents. We develop a formal framework to analyse and quantify agent incentives to adhere to computed matchings. Then, we embed near-feasible stable matchings in this framework and study the trade-offs between instability, capacity modifications, and computational complexity. We prove that capacity modifications can be simultaneously optimal at individual and aggregate levels, and provide efficient algorithms to compute them. We show that different modification strategies significantly affect stability, and establish that minimal modifications and minimal deviation incentives are compatible and efficiently computable under general conditions. Finally, we provide exact algorithms and experimental results for tractable and intractable versions of these problems.

Authors: Andrew Adamatzky

Modern security, infrastructure, and safety-critical systems increasingly operate in environments characterised by disruption, uncertainty, physical damage, and degraded communications. Conventional digital technologies -- centralised sensors, software-defined control, and energy-intensive monitoring -- often struggle under such conditions. We propose fungi, and in particular living mycelial networks, as a novel class of biohybride systems for security, resilience, and protection in extreme environments. We discuss how fungi can function as distributed sensing substrates, self-healing materials, and low-observability anomaly-detection layers. We map fungal properties -- such as decentralised control, embodied memory, and autonomous repair -- to applications in infrastructure protection, environmental monitoring, tamper evidence, and long-duration resilience.

### 2. [Fault Tolerant Design of IGZO-based Binary Search ADCs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10790v1)

Authors: Paula Carolina Lozano Duarte, Sule Ozev, Mehdi Tahoori

Thin-film technologies such as Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO) enable Flexible Electronics (FE) for emerging applications in wearable sensing, personal health monitoring, and large-area systems. Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) serve as critical sensor interfaces in these systems. Yet, their vulnerability to manufacturing defects remains poorly understood despite unipolar technologies' inherently high defect densities and process variations compared to mature CMOS technologies. We present a hierarchical fault injection framework to characterize defect sensitivity in Binary Search ADCs implemented in n-type only technologies. Our methodology combines transistor-level defect characterization with system-level fault propagation analysis, enabling efficient exploration of both single and multiple fault scenarios across the conversion hierarchy. The framework identifies critical fault-sensitive circuit components and enables selective redundancy strategies targeting only the most sensitive components. The resulting defect-tolerant designs improve fault coverage from 60% to 92% under single-fault injections and from 34% to 77.6% under multi-fault injection, while incurring only 4.2% area overhead and 6% power increase. While validated on IGZO-TFTs, the methodology applies to all emerging unipolar technologies.

Authors: Changryeol Lee

While prior work established a verifier-based polynomial time framework for NP, explicit deterministic machines for concrete NP-complete problems have remained elusive.
  In this paper, we construct fully specified deterministic Turing Machines (DTMs) for SAT and Subset-Sum within a polynomial-time NP verifier simulation framework.
  We show that both machines operate in polynomial time and, for satisfiable instances, deterministically generate valid witnesses, thereby extending the framework to deterministic FNP computation without increasing the degree of polynomial complexity. Furthermore, we provide a complete implementation of the framework, including the dynamic computation graph, feasible-graph construction, verification walks, and Turing-machine simulation via edge extensions. The implementation behaves in accordance with the predicted polynomial-time bounds.
  To ensure transparency and reproducibility, the complete Python implementation and source code are made available in a public online repository.

Authors: Derek Christ, Thomas Zimmermann, Philippe Barbie, Dmitri Saberi, Yao Yin, Matthias Jung

The JEDEC committee defines various domain-specific DRAM standards. These standards feature increasingly complex and evolving protocol specifications, which are detailed in timing diagrams and command tables. Understanding these protocols is becoming progressively challenging as new features and complex device hierarchies are difficult to comprehend without an expressive model. While each JEDEC standard features a simplified state machine, this state machine fails to reflect the parallel operation of memory banks.
  In this paper, we present an evolved modeling approach based on timed Petri nets and Python. This model provides a more accurate representation of DRAM protocols, making them easier to understand and directly executable, which enables the evaluation of interesting metrics and the verification of controller RTL models, DRAM logic and memory simulators.

Authors: Charles Constant, Elizabeth Bates, Santosh Bhattarai, Marek Ziebart, Tobias Ritschel

We propose a system to optimize parametric designs subject to radiation pressure, \ie the effect of light on the motion of objects. This is most relevant in the design of spacecraft, where radiation pressure presents the dominant non-conservative forcing mechanism, which is the case beyond approximately 800 km altitude. Despite its importance, the high computational cost of high-fidelity radiation pressure modeling has limited its use in large-scale spacecraft design, optimization, and space situational awareness applications. We enable this by offering three innovations in the simulation, in representation and in optimization: First, a practical computer graphics-inspired Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation of radiation pressure. The simulation is highly parallel, uses importance sampling and next-event estimation to reduce variance and allows simulating an entire family of designs instead of a single spacecraft as in previous work. Second, we introduce neural networks as a representation of forces from design parameters. This neural proxy model, learned from simulations, is inherently differentiable and can query forces orders of magnitude faster than a full MC simulation. Third, and finally, we demonstrate optimizing inverse radiation pressure designs, such as finding geometry, material or operation parameters that minimizes travel time, maximizes proximity given a desired end-point, minimize thruster fuel, trains mission control policies or allocated compute budget in extraterrestrial compute.

Authors: Devansh Jalota, Matthew Tsao

Informal and privatized transit services, such as minibuses and shared auto-rickshaws, are integral to daily travel in large urban metropolises, providing affordable commutes where a formal public transport system is inadequate and other options are unaffordable. Despite the crucial role that these services play in meeting mobility needs, governments often do not account for these services or their underlying incentives when planning transit systems, which can significantly compromise system efficiency.
  Against this backdrop, we develop a framework to analyze the incentives underlying informal and privatized transit systems, while proposing mechanisms to guide public transit operation and incentive design when a substantial share of mobility is provided by such profit-driven private operators. We introduce a novel, analytically tractable game-theoretic model of a fully privatized informal transit system with a fixed menu of routes, in which profit-maximizing informal operators (drivers) decide where to provide service and cost-minimizing commuters (riders) decide whether to use these services. Within this framework, we establish tight price of anarchy bounds which demonstrate that decentralized, profit-maximizing driver behavior can lead to bounded yet substantial losses in cumulative driver profit and rider demand served. We further show that these performance losses can be mitigated through targeted interventions, including Stackelberg routing mechanisms in which a modest share of drivers are centrally controlled, reflecting environments where informal operators coexist with public transit, and cross-subsidization schemes that use route-specific tolls or subsidies to incentivize drivers to operate on particular routes. Finally, we reinforce these findings through numerical experiments based on a real-world informal transit system in Nalasopara, India.

Authors: Haris Aziz, Péter Biró, Gergely Csáji, Tom Demeulemeester

In a typical school choice application, the students have strict preferences over the schools while the schools have coarse priorities over the students based on their distance and their enrolled siblings. The outcome of a centralized admission mechanism is then usually obtained by the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm with random tie-breaking. Therefore, every possible outcome of this mechanism is a stable solution for the coarse priorities that will arise with certain probability. This implies a probabilistic assignment, where the admission probability for each student-school pair is specified. In this paper, we propose a new efficiency-improving stable `smart lottery' mechanism. We aim to improve the probabilistic assignment ex-ante in a stochastic dominance sense, while ensuring that the improved random matching is still ex-post stable, meaning that it can be decomposed into stable matchings regarding the original coarse priorities. Therefore, this smart lottery mechanism can provide a clear Pareto-improvement in expectation for any cardinal utilities compared to the standard DA with lottery solution, without sacrificing the stability of the final outcome. We show that although the underlying computational problem is NP-hard, we can solve the problem by using advanced optimization techniques such as integer programming with column generation. We conduct computational experiments on generated and real instances. Our results show that the welfare gains by our mechanism are substantially larger than the expected gains by standard methods that realize efficiency improvements after ties have already been broken.

### 3. [Characterization and Computation of Normal-Form Proper Equilibria in Extensive-Form Games via the Sequence-Form Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10524v1)

Authors: Yuqing Hou, Yiyin Cao, Chuangyin Dang

Normal-form proper equilibrium, introduced by Myerson as a refinement of normal-form perfect equilibrium, occupies a distinctive position in the equilibrium analysis of extensive-form games because its more stringent perturbation structure entails the sequential rationality. However, the size of the normal-form representation grows exponentially with the number of parallel information sets, making the direct determination of normal-form proper equilibria intractable. To address this challenge, we develop a compact sequence-form proper equilibrium by redefining the expected payoffs over sequences, and we prove that it coincides with the normal-form proper equilibrium via strategic equivalence. To facilitate computation, we further introduce an alternative representation by defining a class of perturbed games based on an $\varepsilon$-permutahedron over sequences. Building on this representation, we introduce two differentiable path-following methods for computing normal-form proper equilibria. These methods rely on artificial sequence-form games whose expected payoff functions incorporate logarithmic or entropy regularization through an auxiliary variable. We prove the existence of a smooth equilibrium path induced by each artificial game, starting from an arbitrary positive realization plan and converging to a normal-form proper equilibrium of the original game as the auxiliary variable approaches zero. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

### 4. [The Computational Intractability of Not Worst Responding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10966v1)

Authors: Mete Şeref Ahunbay, Paul W. Goldberg, Edwin Lock, Panayotis Mertikopoulos, Bary S. R. Pradelski, Bassel Tarbush

Finding, counting, or determining the existence of Nash equilibria, where players must play optimally given each others' actions, are known to be computational intractable problems. We ask whether weakening optimality to the requirement that each player merely avoid worst responses -- arguably the weakest meaningful rationality criterion -- yields tractable solution concepts. We show that it does not: any solution concept with this minimal guarantee is ``as intractable'' as pure Nash equilibrium. In general games, determining the existence of no-worst-response action profiles is NP-complete, finding one is NP-hard, and counting them is #P-complete. In potential games, where existence is guaranteed, the search problem is PLS-complete. Computational intractability therefore stems not only from the requirement of optimality, but also from the requirement of a minimal rationality guarantee for each player. Moreover, relaxing the latter requirement gives rise to a tractability trade-off between the strength of individual rationality guarantees and the fraction of players satisfying them.

### 5. [Equity by Design: Fairness-Driven Recommendation in Heterogeneous Two-Sided Markets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10739v1)

Authors: Dominykas Seputis, Rajeev Verma, Alexander Timans

Two-sided marketplaces embody heterogeneity in incentives: producers seek exposure while consumers seek relevance, and balancing these competing objectives through constrained optimization is now a standard practice. Yet real platforms face finer-grained complexity: consumers differ in preferences and engagement patterns, producers vary in catalog value and capacity, and business objectives impose additional constraints beyond raw relevance. We formalize two-sided fairness under these realistic conditions, extending prior work from soft single-item allocations to discrete multi-item recommendations. We introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a consumer-side objective that compresses group-level utility disparities, and integrate business constraints directly into the optimization. Our experiments reveal that the "free fairness" regime, where producer constraints impose no consumer cost, disappears in multi item settings. Strikingly, moderate fairness constraints can improve business metrics by diversifying exposure away from saturated producers. Scalable solvers match exact solutions at a fraction of the runtime, making fairness-aware allocation practical at scale. These findings reframe fairness not as a tax on platform efficiency but as a lever for sustainable marketplace health.

### 6. [Core-Stable Kidney Exchange via Altruistic Donors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10725v1)

Authors: Gergely Csáji, Thánh Nguyen

Kidney exchange programs among hospitals in the United States and across European countries improve efficiency by pooling donors and patients on a centralized platform. Sustaining such cooperation requires stability. When the core is empty, hospitals or countries may withhold easily matched pairs for internal use, creating incentive problems that undermine participation and reduce the scope and efficiency of exchange.
  We propose a method to restore core stability by augmenting the platform with altruistic donors. Although the worst-case number of required altruists can be large, we show that in realistic settings only a small number is needed. We analyze two models of the compatibility graph, one based on random graphs and the other on compatibility types. When only pairwise exchanges are allowed, the number of required altruists is bounded by the maximum number of independent odd cycles, defined as disjoint odd cycles with no edges between them. This bound grows logarithmically with market size in the random graph model and is at most one third of the number of compatibility types in the type-based model. When small exchange cycles are allowed, it suffices for each participating organization to receive a number of altruists proportional to the number of compatibility types. Finally, simulations show that far fewer altruists are needed in practice than worst-case theory suggests.

### 7. [Necessary President in Elections with Parties](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10601v1)

Authors: Katarína Cechlárová, Ildikó Schlotter

Consider an election where the set of candidates is partitioned into parties, and each party must choose exactly one candidate to nominate for the election held over all nominees. The Necessary President problem asks whether a candidate, if nominated, becomes the winner of the election for all possible nominations from other parties.
  We study the computational complexity of Necessary President for several voting rules. We show that while this problem is solvable in polynomial time for Borda, Maximin, and Copeland$^α$ for every $α\in [0,1]$, it is $\mathsf{coNP}$-complete for general classes of positional scoring rules that include $\ell$-Approval and $\ell$-Veto, even when the maximum size of a party is two. For such positional scoring rules, we show that Necessary President is $\mathsf{W}[2]$-hard when parameterized by the number of parties, but fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the number of voter types. Additionally, we prove that Necessary President for Ranked Pairs is $\mathsf{coNP}$-complete even for maximum party size two, and $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard with respect to the number of parties; remarkably, both of these results hold even for constant number of voters.

### 8. [Utilitarian Distortion Under Probabilistic Voting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11152v1)

Authors: Hamidreza Alipour, Mohak Goyal

The utilitarian distortion framework evaluates voting rules by their worst-case efficiency loss when voters have cardinal utilities but express only ordinal rankings. Under the classical model, a longstanding tension exists: Plurality, which suffers from the spoiler effect, achieves optimal $Θ(m^2)$ distortion among deterministic rules, while normatively superior rules like Copeland and Borda have unbounded distortion. We resolve this tension under probabilistic voting with the Plackett-Luce model, where rankings are noisy reflections of utilities governed by an inverse temperature parameter $β$. Copeland and Borda both achieve at most $β\frac{1+e^{-β}}{1-e^{-β}}$ distortion, independent of the number of candidates $m$, and within a factor of 2 of the lower bound for randomized rules satisfying the probabilistic Condorcet loser criterion known from prior work. This improves upon the prior $O(β^2)$ bound for Borda. These upper bounds are nearly tight: prior work establishes a $(1-o(1))β$ lower bound for Borda, and we prove a $(1-ε)β$ lower bound for Copeland for any constant $ε>0$. In contrast, rules that rely only on top-choice information fare worse: Plurality has distortion $Ω(\min(e^β, m))$ and Random Dictator has distortion $Θ(m)$. Additional `veto' information is also insufficient to remove the dependence on $m$; Plurality Veto and Pruned Plurality Veto have distortion $Ω(β\ln m)$. We also prove a lower bound of $(\frac{5}{8}-ε)β$ (for any constant $ε>0$) for all deterministic finite-precision tournament-based rules, a class that includes Copeland and any rule based on pairwise comparison margins rounded to fixed precision. Our results show that the distortion framework aligns with normative intuitions once the probabilistic nature of real-world voting is taken into account.

### 9. [Online Generalized-mean Welfare Maximization: Achieving Near-Optimal Regret from Samples](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10469v1)

Authors: Zongjun Yang, Rachitesh Kumar, Christian Kroer

We study online fair allocation of $T$ sequentially arriving items among $n$ agents with heterogeneous preferences, with the objective of maximizing generalized-mean welfare, defined as the $p$-mean of agents' time-averaged utilities, with $p\in (-\infty, 1)$. We first consider the i.i.d. arrival model and show that the pure greedy algorithm -- which myopically chooses the welfare-maximizing integral allocation -- achieves $\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ average regret. Importantly, in contrast to prior work, our algorithm does not require distributional knowledge and achieves the optimal regret rate using only the online samples.
  We then go beyond i.i.d. arrivals and investigate a nonstationary model with time-varying independent distributions. In the absence of additional data about the distributions, it is known that every online algorithm must suffer $Ω(1)$ average regret. We show that only a single historical sample from each distribution is sufficient to recover the optimal $\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ average regret rate, even in the face of arbitrary non-stationarity. Our algorithms are based on the re-solving paradigm: they assume that the remaining items will be the ones seen historically in those periods and solve the resulting welfare-maximization problem to determine the decision in every period. Finally, we also account for distribution shifts that may distort the fidelity of historical samples and show that the performance of our re-solving algorithms is robust to such shifts.

### 10. [Let Leaders Play Games: Improving Timing in Leader-based Consensus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11147v1)

Authors: Rasheed M, Parth Desai, Sujit Gujar

Propagation latency is inherent to any distributed network, including blockchains. Typically, blockchain protocols provide a timing buffer for block propagation across the network. In leader-based blockchains, the leader -- block proposer -- is known in advance for each slot. A fast (or low-latency) proposer may delay the block proposal in anticipation of more rewards from the transactions that would otherwise be included in the subsequent block. Deploying such a strategy by manipulating the timing is known as timing games. It increases the risk of missed blocks due to reduced time for other nodes to vote on the block, affecting the overall efficiency of the blockchain. Moreover, proposers who play timing games essentially appropriate MEV (additional rewards over transaction fees and the block reward) that would otherwise accrue to the next block, making it unfair to subsequent block proposers. We propose a double-block proposal mechanism, 2-Prop, to curtail timing games. 2-Prop selects two proposers per slot to propose blocks and confirms one of them. We design a reward-sharing policy for proposers based on how quickly their blocks propagate to avoid strategic deviations. In the induced game, which we call the Latency Game, we show that it is a Nash Equilibrium for the proposers to propose the block without delay under homogeneous network settings. Under heterogeneous network settings, we study many configurations, and our analysis shows that a faster proposer would prefer not to delay unless the other proposer is extremely slow. Thus, we show the efficacy of 2-Prop in mitigating the effect of timing games.

### Human-Computer Interaction

### 1. [Design, Development, and Use of Maya Robot as an Assistant for the Therapy/Education of Children with Cancer: a Pilot Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10942v1)

Authors: Alireza Taheri, Minoo Alemi, Elham Ranjkar, Raman Rafatnejad, Ali F. Meghdari

This study centers around the design and implementation of the Maya Robot, a portable elephant-shaped social robot, intended to engage with children undergoing cancer treatment. Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value < 0.05). This preliminary exploratory study highlights the positive impact of utilizing Maya as an assistant for therapy/education in a clinical setting, particularly benefiting children undergoing cancer treatment. The findings underscore the potential of social robots in pediatric healthcare contexts, emphasizing improved pain management and emotional well-being among young patients.

### 2. [Viewpoint Recommendation for Point Cloud Labeling through Interaction Cost Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10871v1)

Authors: Yu Zhang, Xinyi Zhao, Chongke Bi, Siming Chen

Semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds is important for many applications, such as autonomous driving. To train semantic segmentation models, labeled point cloud segmentation datasets are essential. Meanwhile, point cloud labeling is time-consuming for annotators, which typically involves tuning the camera viewpoint and selecting points by lasso. To reduce the time cost of point cloud labeling, we propose a viewpoint recommendation approach to reduce annotators' labeling time costs. We adapt Fitts' law to model the time cost of lasso selection in point clouds. Using the modeled time cost, the viewpoint that minimizes the lasso selection time cost is recommended to the annotator. We build a data labeling system for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds that integrates our viewpoint recommendation approach. The system enables users to navigate to recommended viewpoints for efficient annotation. Through an ablation study, we observed that our approach effectively reduced the data labeling time cost. We also qualitatively compare our approach with previous viewpoint selection approaches on different datasets.

### 3. [The Effect of Design Thinking on Creative & Innovation Processes: An Empirical Study Across Different Design Experience Levels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10827v1)

Authors: Yuxin Zhang, Fan Zhang

This study employs linear regression and structural equation modeling to explore how Thinking Skills, Design Thinking, Creative Self-Efficacy (CSE), and Collective Creative Efficacy (CCE) drive Design Creativity & Innovation, and analyzes the structural stability of the model across different levels of experience. Path analysis results indicate that the four Design Thinking Skills, Problem-driven Design (beta = 0.198, p < 0.01), Information-driven Design (beta = 0.241, p < 0.001), Solution-driven Design (beta = 0.227, p < 0.001), and Knowledge-driven Design (beta = 0.263, p < 0.001) all significantly and positively influence Design Thinking. Furthermore, Design Thinking has a significant positive predictive effect on Design Creativity & Innovation (beta = 0.286, p < 0.001). Mediation analysis confirms three significant mediation paths: the CSE mediation path (beta = 0.128, p < 0.001), the CCE mediation path (beta = 0.073, p < 0.01), and the "CSE to CCE" chain mediation path (beta = 0.025, p < 0.01). Multi-group comparison results reveal significant differences between the student and professional groups under the full equivalence model. After relaxing specific constraints, there were no significant differences between the nested models of the baseline model, partial measurement invariance, structural weight invariance, and structural covariance invariance. These findings elucidate the multi-dimensional pathways of Design Creativity & Innovation, providing a robust empirical basis for optimizing differentiated pedagogical models and professional practice guidelines.

Authors: Kai Alexander Hackney, Lucas Guarenti Zangari, Jhonathan Sora-Cardenas, Emmanuel Munoz, Sterling R. Kalogeras, Betsy DiSalvo, Pedro Guillermo Feijoo-Garcia

To foster effective human-agent interactions, designers need to identify characteristics that could affect how agents are perceived and accepted, and to what extent they could impact rapport-building. Aiming to explore the role of user-agent synchrony, we assessed 388 participants to determine whether they could perceive personality traits from four artificial voices we selected and adapted from human samples, considering gender (male or female) and personality (introvert or extrovert) as grouping factors. Our findings suggest that participants were able to significantly differentiate female agents by personality, while male agents were not consistently distinguished. We also observed evidence of personality synchrony, where participants tended to perceive the first agent as more similar to their own personality, with this effect driven mainly by male participants, especially toward male agents. This paper contributes findings and insights to consider the interplay of user-agent personality and gender synchrony in the design of human-agent interactions.

### 5. [Division of Labor and Collaboration Between Parents in Family Education](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10501v1)

Authors: Ziyi Wang, Congrong Zhang, Jingying Deng, Xiaofan Hu, Jie Cai, Nan Gao, Chun Yu, Haining Zhang

Homework tutoring work is a demanding and often conflict-prone practice in family life, and parents often lack targeted support for managing its cognitive and emotional burdens. Through interviews with 18 parents of children in grades 1-3, we examine how homework-related labor is divided and coordinated between parents, and where AI might meaningfully intervene. We found three key insights: (1) Homework labor encompasses distinct dimensions: physical, cognitive, and emotional, with the latter two often remaining invisible. (2) We identified father-mother-child triadic dynamics in labor division, with children's feedback as the primary factor shaping parental labor adjustments. (3) Building on prior HCI research, we propose an AI design that prioritizes relationship maintenance over task automation or broad labor mitigation. By employing labor as a lens that integrates care work, we explore the complexities of labor within family contexts, contributing to feminist and care-oriented HCI and to the development of context-sensitive coparenting practices.

Authors: Bijean Ghafouri, Dorsaf Sallami, Luca Luceri, Taylor Lynn Curtis, Jean-Francois Godbout, Emilio Ferrara, Reihaneh Rabbany

Research on misinformation has focused almost exclusively on supply, asking what falsehoods circulate, who produces them, and whether corrections work. A basic demand-side question remains unanswered. When ordinary people can fact-check anything they want, what do they actually ask about? We provide the first large-scale evidence on this question by analyzing close to 2{,}500 statements submitted by 457 participants to an open-ended AI fact-checking system. Each claim is classified along five semantic dimensions (domain, epistemic form, verifiability, target entity, and temporal reference), producing a behavioral map of public verification demand. Three findings stand out. First, users range widely across topics but default to a narrow epistemic repertoire, overwhelmingly submitting simple descriptive claims about present-day observables. Second, roughly one in four requests concerns statements that cannot be empirically resolved, including moral judgments, speculative predictions, and subjective evaluations, revealing a systematic mismatch between what users seek from fact-checking tools and what such tools can deliver. Third, comparison with the FEVER benchmark dataset exposes sharp structural divergences across all five dimensions, indicating that standard evaluation corpora encode a synthetic claim environment that does not resemble real-world verification needs. These results reframe fact-checking as a demand-driven problem and identify where current AI systems and benchmarks are misaligned with the uncertainty people actually experience.

### 7. [LCIP: Loss-Controlled Inverse Projection of High-Dimensional Image Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11141v1)

Authors: Yu Wang, Frederik L. Dennig, Michael Behrisch, Alexandru Telea

Projections (or dimensionality reduction) methods $P$ aim to map high-dimensional data to typically 2D scatterplots for visual exploration. Inverse projection methods $P^{-1}$ aim to map this 2D space to the data space to support tasks such as data augmentation, classifier analysis, and data imputation. Current $P^{-1}$ methods suffer from a fundamental limitation -- they can only generate a fixed surface-like structure in data space, which poorly covers the richness of this space. We address this by a new method that can `sweep' the data space under user control. Our method works generically for any $P$ technique and dataset, is controlled by two intuitive user-set parameters, and is simple to implement. We demonstrate it by an extensive application involving image manipulation for style transfer.

### 8. [Normalized Surveillance in the Datafied Car: How Autonomous Vehicle Users Rationalize Privacy Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11026v1)

Authors: Yehuda Perry, Tawfiq Ammari

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are characterized by pervasive datafication and surveillance through sensors like in-cabin cameras, LIDAR, and GPS. Drawing on 16 semi-structured interviews with AV drivers analyzed using constructivist grounded theory, this study examines how users make sense of vehicular surveillance within everyday datafication. Findings reveal drivers demonstrate few AV-specific privacy concerns, instead normalizing monitoring through comparisons with established digital platforms. We theorize this indifference by situating AV surveillance within the `surveillance ecology' of platform environments, arguing the datafied car functions as a mobile extension of the `leaky home' -- private spaces rendered permeable through connected technologies continuously transmitting behavioral data.
  The study contributes to scholarship on surveillance beliefs, datafication, and platform governance by demonstrating how users who have accepted comprehensive smartphone and smart home monitoring encounter AV datafication as just another node in normalized data extraction. We highlight how geographic restrictions on data access -- currently limiting driver log access to California -- create asymmetries that impede informed privacy deliberation, exemplifying `tertiary digital divides.' Finally, we examine how machine learning's reliance on data-intensive approaches creates structural pressure for surveillance that transcends individual manufacturer choices. We propose governance interventions to democratize social learning, including universal data access rights, binding transparency requirements, and data minimization standards to prevent race-to-the-bottom dynamics in automotive datafication.

Authors: Haoyu Hu, Raja Marjieh, Katherine M Collins, Chenyi Li, Thomas L. Griffiths, Ilia Sucholutsky, Nori Jacoby

Writing code has been one of the most transformative ways for human societies to translate abstract ideas into tangible technologies. Modern AI is transforming this process by enabling experts and non-experts alike to generate code without actually writing code, but instead, through natural language instructions, or "vibe coding". While increasingly popular, the cumulative impact of vibe coding on productivity and collaboration, as well as the role of humans in this process, remains unclear. Here, we introduce a controlled experimental framework for studying collaborative vibe coding and use it to compare human-led, AI-led, and hybrid groups. Across 16 experiments involving 604 human participants, we show that people provide uniquely effective high-level instructions for vibe coding across iterations, whereas AI-provided instructions often result in performance collapse. We further demonstrate that hybrid systems perform best when humans retain directional control (providing the instructions), while evaluation is delegated to AI.

### 10. [Labor, Capital, and Machine: Toward a Labor Process Theory for HCI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10548v1)

Authors: Yigang Qin, EunJeong Cheon

The HCI community has called for renewed attention to labor issues and the political economy of computing. Yet much work remains in engaging with labor theory to better understand modern work and workers. This article traces the development of Labor Process Theory (LPT) -- from Karl Marx and Harry Braverman to Michael Burawoy and beyond -- and introduces it as an essential yet underutilized resource for structural analysis of work under capitalism and the design of computing systems. We examine HCI literature on labor, investigating focal themes and conceptual, empirical, and design approaches. Drawing from LPT, we offer directions for HCI research and practice: distinguish labor from work, link work practice to value production, study up the management, analyze consent and legitimacy, move beyond the point of production, design alternative institutions, and unnaturalize bourgeois designs. These directions can deepen analyses of tech-mediated workplace regimes, inform critical and normative designs, and strengthen the field's connection to broader political economic critique.

### Information Retrieval

### 1. [Compute Only Once: UG-Separation for Efficient Large Recommendation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10455v1)

Driven by scaling laws, recommender systems increasingly rely on large-scale models to capture complex feature interactions and user behaviors, but this trend also leads to prohibitive training and inference costs. While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems.

### 2. [GeoGR: A Generative Retrieval Framework for Spatio-Temporal Aware POI Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10411v1)

Authors: Fangye Wang, Haowen Lin, Yifang Yuan, Siyuan Wang, Xiaojiang Zhou, Song Yang, Pengjie Wang

Next Point-of-Interest (POI) prediction is a fundamental task in location-based services, especially critical for large-scale navigation platforms like AMAP that serve billions of users across diverse lifestyle scenarios. While recent POI recommendation approaches based on SIDs have achieved promising, they struggle in complex, sparse real-world environments due to two key limitations: (1) inadequate modeling of high-quality SIDs that capture cross-category spatio-temporal collaborative relationships, and (2) poor alignment between large language models (LLMs) and the POI recommendation task. To this end, we propose GeoGR, a geographic generative recommendation framework tailored for navigation-based LBS like AMAP, which perceives users' contextual state changes and enables intent-aware POI recommendation. GeoGR features a two-stage design: (i) a geo-aware SID tokenization pipeline that explicitly learns spatio-temporal collaborative semantic representations via geographically constrained co-visited POI pairs, contrastive learning, and iterative refinement; and (ii) a multi-stage LLM training strategy that aligns non-native SID tokens through multiple template-based continued pre-training(CPT) and enables autoregressive POI generation via supervised fine-tuning(SFT). Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate GeoGR's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, deployment on the AMAP platform, serving millions of users with multiple online metrics boosting, confirms its practical effectiveness and scalability in production.

E-commerce campaign ranking models require large-scale training labels indicating which users purchased due to campaign influence. However, generating these labels is challenging because campaigns use creative, thematic language that does not directly map to product purchases. Without clear product-level attribution, supervised learning for campaign optimization remains limited. We present \textbf{Campaign-2-PT-RAG}, a scalable label generation framework that constructs user--campaign purchase labels by inferring which product types (PTs) each campaign promotes. The framework first interprets campaign content using large language models (LLMs) to capture implicit intent, then retrieves candidate PTs through semantic search over the platform taxonomy. A structured LLM-based classifier evaluates each PT's relevance, producing a campaign-specific product coverage set. User purchases matching these PTs generate positive training labels for downstream ranking models. This approach reframes the ambiguous attribution problem into a tractable semantic alignment task, enabling scalable and consistent supervision for downstream tasks such as campaign ranking optimization in production e-commerce environments. Experiments on internal and synthetic datasets, validated against expert-annotated campaign--PT mappings, show that our LLM-assisted approach generates high-quality labels with 78--90% precision while maintaining over 99% recall.

### 4. [VulReaD: Knowledge-Graph-guided Software Vulnerability Reasoning and Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10787v1)

Authors: Samal Mukhtar, Yinghua Yao, Zhu Sun, Mustafa Mustafa, Yew Soon Ong, Youcheng Sun

Software vulnerability detection (SVD) is a critical challenge in modern systems. Large language models (LLMs) offer natural-language explanations alongside predictions, but most work focuses on binary evaluation, and explanations often lack semantic consistency with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability.

### 5. [Boundary-Aware Multi-Behavior Dynamic Graph Transformer for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10493v1)

Authors: Jingsong Su, Xuetao Ma, Mingming Li, Qiannan Zhu, Yu Guo

In the landscape of contemporary recommender systems, user-item interactions are inherently dynamic and sequential, often characterized by various behaviors. Prior research has explored the modeling of user preferences through sequential interactions and the user-item interaction graph, utilizing advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. However, these methods typically fall short in simultaneously accounting for the dynamic nature of graph topologies and the sequential pattern of interactions in user preference models. Moreover, they often fail to adequately capture the multiple user behavior boundaries during model optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a boundary-aware Multi-Behavioral Dynamic Graph Transformer (MB-DGT) model that dynamically refines the graph structure to reflect the evolving patterns of user behaviors and interactions. Our model involves a transformer-based dynamic graph aggregator for user preference modeling, which assimilates the changing graph structure and the sequence of user behaviors. This integration yields a more comprehensive and dynamic representation of user preferences. For model optimization, we implement a user-specific multi-behavior loss function that delineates the interest boundaries among different behaviors, thereby enriching the personalized learning of user preferences. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets indicate that our model consistently delivers remarkable recommendation performance.

Authors: Jialin Liu, Zhaorui Zhang, Ray C. C. Cheung

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized recommender systems by effectively modeling complex user-item interactions, yet data sparsity and the item cold-start problem significantly impair performance, particularly for new items with limited or no interaction history. While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.

Authors: Mingyang Liu, Yong Bai, Zhangming Chan, Sishuo Chen, Xiang-Rong Sheng, Han Zhu, Jian Xu, Xinyang Chen

Efficiently scaling industrial Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction has recently attracted significant research attention. Existing approaches typically employ early aggregation of user behaviors to maintain efficiency. However, such non-unified or partially unified modeling creates an information bottleneck by discarding fine-grained, token-level signals essential for unlocking scaling gains. In this work, we revisit the fundamental distinctions between CTR prediction and Large Language Models (LLMs), identifying two critical properties: the asymmetry in information density between behavioral and non-behavioral features, and the modality-specific priors of content-rich signals. Accordingly, we propose the Efficiently Scalable Transformer (EST), which achieves fully unified modeling by processing all raw inputs in a single sequence without lossy aggregation. EST integrates two modules: Lightweight Cross-Attention (LCA), which prunes redundant self-interactions to focus on high-impact cross-feature dependencies, and Content Sparse Attention (CSA), which utilizes content similarity to dynamically select high-signal behaviors. Extensive experiments show that EST exhibits a stable and efficient power-law scaling relationship, enabling predictable performance gains with model scale. Deployed on Taobao's display advertising platform, EST significantly outperforms production baselines, delivering a 3.27\% RPM (Revenue Per Mile) increase and a 1.22\% CTR lift, establishing a practical pathway for scalable industrial CTR prediction models.

### 8. [End-to-End Semantic ID Generation for Generative Advertisement Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10445v1)

Authors: Jie Jiang, Xinxun Zhang, Enming Zhang, Yuling Xiong, Jun Zhang, Jingwen Wang, Huan Yu, Yuxiang Wang, Hao Wang, Xiao Yan, Jiawei Jiang

Generative Recommendation (GR) has excelled by framing recommendation as next-token prediction. This paradigm relies on Semantic IDs (SIDs) to tokenize large-scale items into discrete sequences. Existing GR approaches predominantly generate SIDs via Residual Quantization (RQ), where items are encoded into embeddings and then quantized to discrete SIDs. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations: 1) Objective misalignment and semantic degradation stemming from the two-stage compression; 2) Error accumulation inherent in the structure of RQ. To address these limitations, we propose UniSID, a Unified SID generation framework for generative advertisement recommendation. Specifically, we jointly optimize embeddings and SIDs in an end-to-end manner from raw advertising data, enabling semantic information to flow directly into the SID space and thus addressing the inherent limitations of the two-stage cascading compression paradigm. To capture fine-grained semantics, a multi-granularity contrastive learning strategy is introduced to align distinct items across SID levels. Finally, a summary-based ad reconstruction mechanism is proposed to encourage SIDs to capture high-level semantic information that is not explicitly present in advertising contexts. Experiments demonstrate that UniSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SID generation methods, yielding up to a 4.62% improvement in Hit Rate metrics across downstream advertising scenarios compared to the strongest baseline.

### 9. [Equity by Design: Fairness-Driven Recommendation in Heterogeneous Two-Sided Markets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10739v1)

Authors: Dominykas Seputis, Rajeev Verma, Alexander Timans

Two-sided marketplaces embody heterogeneity in incentives: producers seek exposure while consumers seek relevance, and balancing these competing objectives through constrained optimization is now a standard practice. Yet real platforms face finer-grained complexity: consumers differ in preferences and engagement patterns, producers vary in catalog value and capacity, and business objectives impose additional constraints beyond raw relevance. We formalize two-sided fairness under these realistic conditions, extending prior work from soft single-item allocations to discrete multi-item recommendations. We introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a consumer-side objective that compresses group-level utility disparities, and integrate business constraints directly into the optimization. Our experiments reveal that the "free fairness" regime, where producer constraints impose no consumer cost, disappears in multi item settings. Strikingly, moderate fairness constraints can improve business metrics by diversifying exposure away from saturated producers. Scalable solvers match exact solutions at a fraction of the runtime, making fairness-aware allocation practical at scale. These findings reframe fairness not as a tax on platform efficiency but as a lever for sustainable marketplace health.

### 10. [A Cognitive Distribution and Behavior-Consistent Framework for Black-Box Attacks on Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10633v1)

Authors: Hongyue Zhan, Mingming Li, Dongqin Liu, Hui Wang, Yaning Zhang, Xi Zhou, Honglei Lv, Jiao Dai, Jizhong Han

With the growing deployment of sequential recommender systems in e-commerce and other fields, their black-box interfaces raise security concerns: models are vulnerable to extraction and subsequent adversarial manipulation. Existing black-box extraction attacks primarily rely on hard labels or pairwise learning, often ignoring the importance of ranking positions, which results in incomplete knowledge transfer. Moreover, adversarial sequences generated via pure gradient methods lack semantic consistency with real user behavior, making them easily detectable. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-enhanced attack framework. First, drawing on primacy effects and position bias, we introduce a cognitive distribution-driven extraction mechanism that maps discrete rankings into continuous value distributions with position-aware decay, thereby advancing from order alignment to cognitive distribution alignment. Second, we design a behavior-aware noisy item generation strategy that jointly optimizes collaborative signals and gradient signals. This ensures both semantic coherence and statistical stealth while effectively promoting target item rankings. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both attack success rate and evasion rate, validating the value of integrating cognitive modeling and behavioral consistency for secure recommender systems.

Authors: Ammar Ali, Baher Mohammad, Denis Makhov, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Magauiya Zhussip, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis

We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\% of the original model's performance at 30\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.

Authors: Li Sun, Qiqi Wan, Suyang Zhou, Zhenhao Huang, Philip S. Yu

Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.

### 3. [Near-Constant Strong Violation and Last-Iterate Convergence for Online CMDPs via Decaying Safety Margins](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10917v1)

Authors: Qian Zuo, Zhiyong Wang, Fengxiang He

We study safe online reinforcement learning in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under strong regret and violation metrics, which forbid error cancellation over time. Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument. Experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.

### 4. [ICA: Information-Aware Credit Assignment for Visually Grounded Long-Horizon Information-Seeking Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10863v1)

Authors: Cong Pang, Xuyu Feng, Yujie Yi, Zixuan Chen, Jiawei Hong, Tiankuo Yao, Nang Yuan, Jiapeng Luo, Lewei Lu, Xin Lou

Despite the strong performance achieved by reinforcement learning-trained information-seeking agents, learning in open-ended web environments remains severely constrained by low signal-to-noise feedback. Text-based parsers often discard layout semantics and introduce unstructured noise, while long-horizon training typically relies on sparse outcome rewards that obscure which retrieval actions actually matter. We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments. The code and datasets will be released in https://github.com/pc-inno/ICA_MM_deepsearch.git.

### 5. [Co-jump: Cooperative Jumping with Quadrupedal Robots via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10514v1)

Authors: Shihao Dong, Yeke Chen, Zeren Luo, Jiahui Zhang, Bowen Xu, Jinghan Lin, Yimin Han, Ji Ma, Zhiyou Yu, Yudong Zhao, Peng Lu

While single-agent legged locomotion has witnessed remarkable progress, individual robots remain fundamentally constrained by physical actuation limits. To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments.

### 6. [Low-Dimensional Execution Manifolds in Transformer Learning Dynamics: Evidence from Modular Arithmetic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10496v1)

Authors: Yongzhong Xu

We investigate the geometric structure of learning dynamics in overparameterized transformer models through carefully controlled modular arithmetic tasks. Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning.

Authors: Zihao Li, Hongyi Lu, Yanan Guo, Zhenkai Zhang, Shuai Wang, Fengwei Zhang

GPU memory errors are a critical threat to deep learning (DL) frameworks, leading to crashes or even security issues. We introduce GPU-Fuzz, a fuzzer locating these issues efficiently by modeling operator parameters as formal constraints. GPU-Fuzz utilizes a constraint solver to generate test cases that systematically probe error-prone boundary conditions in GPU kernels. Applied to PyTorch, TensorFlow, and PaddlePaddle, we uncovered 13 unknown bugs, demonstrating the effectiveness of GPU-Fuzz in finding memory errors.

### 8. [Compute Only Once: UG-Separation for Efficient Large Recommendation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10455v1)

Driven by scaling laws, recommender systems increasingly rely on large-scale models to capture complex feature interactions and user behaviors, but this trend also leads to prohibitive training and inference costs. While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems.

### 9. [QTALE: Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10431v1)

Authors: Kanghyun Noh, Jinheon Choi, Yulwha Kim

Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory resources, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.

Authors: Jie Jiang, Yusen Huo, Xiangxin Zhan, Changping Wang, Jun Zhang

Policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) has established itself as the dominant paradigm in generative recommendation for optimizing sequential user interactions. However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks.

### 1. [Amortized Inference of Neuron Parameters on Analog Neuromorphic Hardware](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10763v1)

Authors: Jakob Kaiser, Eric Müller, Johannes Schemmel

Our work utilized a non-sequential simulation-based inference algorithm to provide an amortized neural density estimator, which approximates the posterior distribution for seven parameters of the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron model of the analog neuromorphic BrainScaleS-2 substrate. We constrained the large parameter space by training a binary classifier to predict parameter combinations yielding observations in regimes of interest, i.e. moderate spike counts. We compared two neural density estimators: one using handcrafted summary statistics and one using a summary network trained in combination with the neural density estimator. The summary network yielded a more focused posterior and generated posterior predictive traces that accurately captured the membrane potential dynamics. When using handcrafted summary statistics, posterior predictive traces match the included features but show deviations in the exact dynamics. The posteriors showed signs of bias and miscalibration but were still able to yield posterior predictive samples that were close to the target observations on which the posteriors were constrained. Our results validate amortized simulation-based inference as a tool for parameterizing analog neuron circuits.

### 2. [Interactive LLM-assisted Curriculum Learning for Multi-Task Evolutionary Policy Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10891v1)

Authors: Berfin Sakallioglu, Giorgia Nadizar, Eric Medvet

Multi-task policy search is a challenging problem because policies are required to generalize beyond training cases. Curriculum learning has proven to be effective in this setting, as it introduces complexity progressively. However, designing effective curricula is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain expertise. LLM-based curriculum generation has only recently emerged as a potential solution, but was limited to operate in static, offline modes without leveraging real-time feedback from the optimizer. Here we propose an interactive LLM-assisted framework for online curriculum generation, where the LLM adaptively designs training cases based on real-time feedback from the evolutionary optimization process. We investigate how different feedback modalities, ranging from numeric metrics alone to combinations with plots and behavior visualizations, influence the LLM ability to generate meaningful curricula. Through a 2D robot navigation case study, tackled with genetic programming as optimizer, we evaluate our approach against static LLM-generated curricula and expert-designed baselines. We show that interactive curriculum generation outperforms static approaches, with multimodal feedback incorporating both progression plots and behavior visualizations yielding performance competitive with expert-designed curricula. This work contributes to understanding how LLMs can serve as interactive curriculum designers for embodied AI systems, with potential extensions to broader evolutionary robotics applications.

Authors: Dongyang Li, Kunpeng Xie, Mingyang Wu, Yiwei Kong, Jiahua Tang, Haoyang Qin, Chen Wei, Quanying Liu

Whereas most brain-computer interface research has focused on decoding neural signals into behavior or intent, the reverse challenge-using controlled stimuli to steer brain activity-remains far less understood, particularly in the visual domain. However, designing images that consistently elicit desired neural responses is difficult: subjective states lack clear quantitative measures, and EEG feedback is both noisy and non-differentiable. We introduce MindPilot, the first closed-loop framework that uses EEG signals as optimization feedback to guide naturalistic image generation. Unlike prior work limited to invasive settings or low-level flicker stimuli, MindPilot leverages non-invasive EEG with natural images, treating the brain as a black-box function and employing a pseudo-model guidance mechanism to iteratively refine images without requiring explicit rewards or gradients. We validate MindPilot in both simulation and human experiments, demonstrating (i) efficient retrieval of semantic targets, (ii) closed-loop optimization of EEG features, and (iii) human-subject validations in mental matching and emotion regulation tasks. Our results establish the feasibility of EEG-guided image synthesis and open new avenues for non-invasive closed-loop brain modulation, bidirectional brain-computer interfaces, and neural signal-guided generative modeling.

Authors: Tao Li, Yulin Tang, Yiyang Song, Cong Wu, Xihui Liu, Pan Li, Xianhao Chen

Federated fine-tuning of on-device large language models (LLMs) mitigates privacy concerns by preventing raw data sharing. However, the intensive computational and memory demands pose significant challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, split federated learning (SFL) emerges as a promising solution that partitions the model into lightweight client-side and compute-intensive server-side sub-models, thus offloading the primary training workload to a powerful server. Nevertheless, high-dimensional activation exchanges in SFL lead to excessive communication overhead. To overcome this, we propose SplitCom, a communication-efficient SFL framework for LLMs that exploits temporal redundancy in activations across consecutive training epochs. Inspired by video compression, the core innovation of our framework lies in selective activation uploading only when a noticeable deviation from previous epochs occurs. To balance communication efficiency and learning performance, we introduce two adaptive threshold control schemes based on 1) bang-bang control or 2) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we implement dimensionality reduction techniques to alleviate client-side memory requirements. Furthermore, we extend SplitCom to the U-shape architecture, ensuring the server never accesses clients' labels. Extensive simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate that SplitCom reduces uplink communication costs by up to 98.6\,\% in its standard configuration and total communication costs by up to 95.8\,\% in its U-shape variant without noticeably compromising model performance.

### 2. [To Reconfigure or Not to Reconfigure: Optimizing All-to-All Collectives in Circuit-Switched Photonic Interconnects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10468v1)

Authors: Anchengcheng Zhou, Vamsi Addanki, Maria Apostolaki

All-to-all collective communication is a core primitive in distributed machine learning and high-performance computing. At the server scale, the communication demands of these workloads are increasingly outstripping the bandwidth and energy limits of electrical interconnects, driving a growing interest in photonic interconnects. However, leveraging these interconnects for all-to-all communication is nontrivial. The core challenge lies in jointly optimizing a sequence of topologies and flow schedules, reconfiguring only when the transmission savings from traversing shorter paths outweigh the reconfiguration cost. Yet the search space of this joint optimization is enormous. Existing work sidesteps this challenge by making unrealistic assumptions on reconfiguration costs so that it is never or always worthwhile to reconfigure. In this paper, we show that any candidate sequence of topologies and flow schedules can be expressed as a sum of adjacency matrices and their powers. This abstraction captures the entire solution space and yields a lower bound on all-to-all completion time. Building on this formulation, we identify a family of topology sequences with strong symmetry and high expansion that admits bandwidth-efficient schedules, which our algorithm constructs with low computational overhead. Together, these insights allow us to efficiently construct near-optimal solutions, effectively avoiding enumeration of the combinatorial design space. Evaluation shows that our approach reduces all-to-all completion time by up to 44% on average across a wide range of network parameters, message sizes and workload types.

Authors: Bruno Rodrigues, Karim Khamaisi

Wireless sensing approaches promise to transform smart infrastructures into privacy-preserving motion detectors, yet commercial adoption remains limited. A common assumption may explain this gap: that denser sensor deployments yield better accuracy. We tested this assumption with a 12-day naturalistic study using a 9-node ESP32-C3 mesh (72 sensing links) in a residential environment. Our results show that a single well-placed link outperformed the full 72-link mesh (AUC 0.541 vs. 0.489, Cohen's $d$=0.86). Even a random link selection matched optimized selection ($p$=0.35). The benefit comes from avoiding multi-link fusion, not from choosing the right link. We attribute this to a "dilution effect": links whose Fresnel zones miss activity regions contribute noise that overwhelms signal from informative links. In our deployment, strategic link placement mattered 2.7$\times$ more than classifier choice. We release 312 hours of labeled CSI data, firmware, and analysis code to enable validation across diverse environments.

### 4. [Supercharging Packet-level Network Simulation of Large Model Training via Memoization and Fast-Forwarding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10615v1)

Authors: Fei Long, Kaihui Gao, Li Chen, Dan Li, Yiwei Zhang, Fei Gui, Yitao Xing, Wenjia Wei, Bingyang Liu

Packet-level discrete-event simulation (PLDES) is a prevalent tool for evaluating detailed performance of large model training. Although PLDES offers high fidelity and generality, its slow performance has plagued networking practitioners. Existing optimization techniques either simplify the network model, resulting in large errors; or execute it in parallel using multiple processors, with an upper bound on speedup. This paper explores an alternative optimization direction that reduces the computational loads of PLDES while maintaining high fidelity. Our key insight is that, in distributed LLM training, packet-level traffic behaviors often exhibit repetitive contention patterns and steady-states where flow rates stabilize, ignoring these redundant discrete events speeds up the simulation considerably and the error is negligible. We realize this idea by proposing Wormhole, a user-transparent PLDES kernel capable of automatically memoization for unsteady-states and skipping for steady-states. Wormhole adopts network partitioning, state memoization and reuse, and rate-based steady-state identification to accurately determine the periods of each flow's steady-state, while maintaining simulation consistency after fast-forwarding. Experiments demonstrate that Wormhole can achieve a 744x speedup over the original ns-3 (510x for MoE workload), with a bounded error of <1%. Applying current multithreading parallel techniques and Wormhole together allows a 1012x speedup, reducing the simulation time for one GPT-13B training under 128 GPUs from 9 hours to 5 minutes.

### 5. [AI Infrastructure Sovereignty](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10900v1)

Authors: Sergio Cruzes

Artificial intelligence has shifted from a software-centric discipline to an infrastructure-driven system. Large-scale training and inference increasingly depend on tightly coupled data centers, high-capacity optical networks, and energy systems operating close to physical and environmental limits. As a result, control over data and algorithms alone is no longer sufficient to achieve meaningful AI sovereignty. Practical sovereignty now depends on who can deploy, operate, and adapt AI infrastructure under constraints imposed by energy availability, sustainability targets, and network reach. This tutorial-survey introduces the concept of AI infrastructure sovereignty, defined as the ability of a region, operator, or nation to exercise operational control over AI systems within physical and environmental limits. The paper argues that sovereignty emerges from the co-design of three layers: AI-oriented data centers, optical transport networks, and automation frameworks that provide real-time visibility and control. We analyze how AI workloads reshape data center design, driving extreme power densities, advanced cooling requirements, and tighter coupling to local energy systems, with sustainability metrics such as carbon intensity and water usage acting as hard deployment boundaries. We then examine optical networks as the backbone of distributed AI, showing how latency, capacity, failure domains, and jurisdictional control define practical sovereignty limits. Building on this foundation, the paper positions telemetry, agentic AI, and digital twins as enablers of operational sovereignty through validated, closed-loop control across compute, network, and energy domains. The tutorial concludes with a reference architecture for sovereign AI infrastructure that integrates telemetry pipelines, agent-based control, and digital twins, framing sustainability as a first-order design constraint.

### 6. [A Robust Optimization Approach for Regenerator Placement in Fault-Tolerant Networks Under Discrete Cost Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11058v1)

Authors: Mohammad Khosravi, Setareh Maghsudi

We focus on robust, survivable communication networks, where network links and nodes are affected by an uncertainty set. In this sense, any network links might fail. Besides, a signal can only travel a maximum distance before its quality falls below a certain threshold, necessitating its regeneration by regenerators installed at network nodes. In addition, the price of installing and maintaining regenerators belongs to a discrete uncertainty set. Robust optimization seeks a solution with guaranteed performance against all scenarios modeled in an uncertainty set. Thus, the problem is to find a subset of nodes with minimum cost for the placement of the regenerator, ensuring that all nodes can communicate even if a subset of network links fails. To solve the problem optimally, we propose two solution approaches, including one flow-based and one cut-based integer programming formulation, as well as their iterative exact method. Our theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of our methods.

Authors: Isaac Keslassy, Ilay Yavlovich, Jose Yallouz, Tzu-Chien Hsueh, Yeshaiahu Fainman, Bill Lin

This paper aims to apply two major scaling transformations from the computing packaging industry to internet routers: the heterogeneous integration of high-bandwidth memories (HBMs) and chiplets, as well as in-package optics. We propose a novel internet router architecture that employs these technologies to achieve a petabit/sec router within a single integrated package. At the top-level, we introduce a novel split-parallel switch architecture that spatially divides (without processing) the incoming fibers and distributes them across smaller independent switches without intermediate OEO conversions or fine-tuned per-packet load-balancing. This passive spatial division enables scaling at the cost of a coarser traffic load balancing. Yet, through extensive evaluations of backbone network traffic, we demonstrate that differences with fine-tuned approaches are small. In addition, we propose a novel HBM-based shared-memory architecture for the implementation of the smaller independent switches, and we introduce a novel parallel frame interleaving algorithm that packs traffic into frames so that HBM banks are accessed at peak HBM data rates in a cyclical interleaving manner. We further discuss why these new technologies represent a paradigm shift in the design of future internet routers. Finally, we emphasize that power consumption may constitute the primary bottleneck to scaling.

### 8. [WHEREIS: IP Address Registration Geo-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11102v1)

Authors: Robert Beverly, Amreesh Phokeer, Oliver Gasser

The five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) provide the critical function of IP address resource del egation and registration. The accuracy of registration data directly impacts Internet operation, management, security, and optimization. In addition, the scarcity of IP addresses has brought into focus conflicts between RIR policy and IP registration ownership and use. The tension between a free-market based approach to address allocation versus policies to promote fairness and regional equity has resulted in court litigation that threatens the very existence of the RIR system.
  We develop WHEREIS, a measurement-based approach to geolocate delegated IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes at an RIR-region granularity and systematically study where addresses are used post-allocation and the extent to which registration information is accurate. We define a taxonomy of registration ``geo-consistency'' that compares a prefix's measured geolocation to the allocating RIR's coverage region as well as the registered organization's location. While in aggregate over 98% of the prefixes we examine are consistent with our geolocation inferences, there is substantial variation across RIRs and we focus on AFRINIC as a case study. IPv6 registrations are no more consistent than IPv4, suggesting that structural, rather than technical, issues play an important role in allocations. We solicit additional information on inconsistent prefixes from network operators, IP leasing providers, and collaborate with three RIRs to obtain validation. We further show that the inconsistencies we discover manifest in three commercial geolocation databases. By improving the transparency around post-allocation prefix use, we hope to improve applications that use IP registration data and inform ongoing discussions over in-region address use and policy.

### 10. [Predictive-State Communication: Innovation Coding and Reconciliation under Delay](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10542v1)

Authors: Ozgur Ercetin, Mohaned Chraiti

Shannon theory models communication as the reliable transfer of symbol sequences, with performance governed by capacity and rate-distortion limits. When both endpoints possess strong predictors -- as in modern large language models and related generative priors -- literal symbol transport is no longer the only operational regime. We propose predictive-state communication (PSC), in which the transmitter and receiver maintain an explicit shared predictive state, and the physical channel is used primarily to convey innovations, i.e., corrective information that reconciles the receiver's provisional trajectory with the transmitter's realized trajectory. This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality.

### 1. [Enhancing Predictability of Multi-Tenant DNN Inference for Autonomous Vehicles' Perception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11004v1)

Authors: Liangkai Liu, Kang G. Shin, Jinkyu Lee, Chengmo Yang, Weisong Shi

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.

Authors: Srishti Siddharth, Vivek Natarajan, Ravi N. Banavar

In this paper, we derive the continuous space-time equations of motion of a three-dimensional geometrically exact rod, or the Cosserat rod, incorporating planar cross-sectional deformation. We then adopt the Lie group variational integrator technique to obtain a discrete model of the rod incorporating both rotational motion and cross-sectional deformation as well. The resulting discrete model possesses several desirable features: it ensures volume conservation of the discrete elements by considering cross-sectional deformation through a local dilatation factor, it demonstrates the beneficial properties associated with the variational integrator technique, such as the preservation of the rotational configuration, and energy conservation with a bounded error. An exhaustive set of numerical results under various initial conditions of the rod demonstrates the efficacy of the model in replicating the physics of the system.

Authors: Ramtin Tabatabaei, Alireza Taheri

During multi-party interactions, gaze direction is a key indicator of interest and intent, making it essential for social robots to direct their attention appropriately. Understanding the social context is crucial for robots to engage effectively, predict human intentions, and navigate interactions smoothly. This study aims to develop an empirical motion-time pattern for human gaze behavior in various social situations (e.g., entering, leaving, waving, talking, and pointing) using deep neural networks based on participants' data. We created two video clips-one for a computer screen and another for a virtual reality headset-depicting different social scenarios. Data were collected from 30 participants: 15 using an eye-tracker and 15 using an Oculus Quest 1 headset. Deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, were used to analyze and predict gaze patterns. Our models achieved 60% accuracy in predicting gaze direction in a 2D animation and 65% accuracy in a 3D animation. Then, the best model was implemented onto the Nao robot; and 36 new participants evaluated its performance. The feedback indicated overall satisfaction, with those experienced in robotics rating the models more favorably.

Authors: Martin Gromniak, Jan-Gerrit Habekost, Sebastian Kamp, Sven Magg, Stefan Wermter

We introduce a Generalizable Neural Radiance Field approach for predicting 3D workspace occupancy from egocentric robot observations. Unlike prior methods operating in camera-centric coordinates, our model constructs occupancy representations in a global workspace frame, making it directly applicable to robotic manipulation. The model integrates flexible source views and generalizes to unseen object arrangements without scene-specific finetuning. We demonstrate the approach on a humanoid robot and evaluate predicted geometry against 3D sensor ground truth. Trained on 40 real scenes, our model achieves 26mm reconstruction error, including occluded regions, validating its ability to infer complete 3D occupancy beyond traditional stereo vision methods.

Authors: Alireza Taheri, Minoo Alemi, Elham Ranjkar, Raman Rafatnejad, Ali F. Meghdari

This study centers around the design and implementation of the Maya Robot, a portable elephant-shaped social robot, intended to engage with children undergoing cancer treatment. Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value < 0.05). This preliminary exploratory study highlights the positive impact of utilizing Maya as an assistant for therapy/education in a clinical setting, particularly benefiting children undergoing cancer treatment. The findings underscore the potential of social robots in pediatric healthcare contexts, emphasizing improved pain management and emotional well-being among young patients.

Authors: Shihao Dong, Yeke Chen, Zeren Luo, Jiahui Zhang, Bowen Xu, Jinghan Lin, Yimin Han, Ji Ma, Zhiyou Yu, Yudong Zhao, Peng Lu

While single-agent legged locomotion has witnessed remarkable progress, individual robots remain fundamentally constrained by physical actuation limits. To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments.

### 7. [3D-Printed Anisotropic Soft Magnetic Coating for Directional Rolling of a Magnetically Actuated Capsule Robot](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10688v1)

Authors: Jin Zhou, Chongxun Wang, Zikang Shen, Fangzhou Xia

Capsule robots are promising tools for minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy, with applications from gastrointestinal endoscopy to targeted drug delivery and biopsy sampling. Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing the usable cavity by about 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. We propose a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets, enabling locomotion via a thin, functional shell while preserving the entire interior cavity as a continuous volume for medical payloads. The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability. Together, these advances aim to transition coating-based capsule robots toward reliable clinical deployment and broaden their applications in minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy.

### 8. [Assessing Vision-Language Models for Perception in Autonomous Underwater Robotic Software](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10655v1)

Authors: Muhammad Yousaf, Aitor Arrieta, Shaukat Ali, Paolo Arcaini, Shuai Wang

Autonomous Underwater Robots (AURs) operate in challenging underwater environments, including low visibility and harsh water conditions. Such conditions present challenges for software engineers developing perception modules for the AUR software. To successfully carry out these tasks, deep learning has been incorporated into the AUR software to support its operations. However, the unique challenges of underwater environments pose difficulties for deep learning models, which often rely on labeled data that is scarce and noisy. This may undermine the trustworthiness of AUR software that relies on perception modules. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for AUR software as they generalize to unseen objects and remain robust in noisy conditions by inferring information from contextual cues. Despite this potential, their performance and uncertainty in underwater environments remain understudied from a software engineering perspective. Motivated by the needs of an industrial partner in assurance and risk management for maritime systems to assess the potential use of VLMs in this context, we present an empirical evaluation of VLM-based perception modules within the AUR software. We assess their ability to detect underwater trash by computing performance, uncertainty, and their relationship, to enable software engineers to select appropriate VLMs for their AUR software.

### 9. [Flow-Enabled Generalization to Human Demonstrations in Few-Shot Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10594v1)

Authors: Runze Tang, Penny Sweetser

Imitation Learning (IL) enables robots to learn complex skills from demonstrations without explicit task modeling, but it typically requires large amounts of demonstrations, creating significant collection costs. Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.

Authors: Alfonso Sciacchitano, Liraz Mudrik, Sean Kragelund, Isaac Kaminer

Accurate localization of maritime targets by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remains challenging in GPS-denied environments. UAVs equipped with gimballed electro-optical sensors are typically used to localize targets, however, reliance on these sensors increases mechanical complexity, cost, and susceptibility to single-point failures, limiting scalability and robustness in multi-UAV operations. This work presents a new trajectory optimization framework that enables cooperative target localization using UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras operating in coordination with a surface vessel. This estimation-aware optimization generates dynamically feasible trajectories that explicitly account for mission constraints, platform dynamics, and out-of-frame events. Estimation-aware trajectories outperform heuristic paths by reducing localization error by more than a factor of two, motivating their use in cooperative operations. Results further demonstrate that coordinated UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras achieve localization accuracy that meets or exceeds that of single gimballed systems, while substantially lowering system complexity and cost, enabling scalability, and enhancing mission resilience.

Authors: Weichen Yu, Ravi Mangal, Yinyi Luo, Kai Hu, Jingxuan He, Corina S. Pasareanu, Matt Fredrikson

Large Language Models are rapidly becoming core components of modern software development workflows, yet ensuring code security remains challenging. Existing vulnerability detection pipelines either rely on static analyzers or use LLM/GNN-based detectors trained with coarse program-level supervision. Both families often require complete context, provide sparse end-of-completion feedback, and can degrade as code length grows, making them ill-suited for real-time, prefix-level assessment during interactive coding and streaming generation. We propose SecCodePRM, a security-oriented process reward model that assigns a context-aware, step-level security score along a code trajectory. To train the model, we derive step-level supervision labels from static analyzers and expert annotations, allowing the model to attend more precisely to fine-grained regions associated with inter-procedural vulnerabilities. SecCodePRM has three applications: full-code vulnerability detection (VD), partial-code VD, and secure code generation (CG). For VD, SecCodePRM uses risk-sensitive aggregation that emphasizes high-risk steps; for CG, SecCodePRM supports inference-time scaling by ranking candidate continuations and favoring higher cumulative reward. This design yields dense, real-time feedback that scales to long-horizon generation. Empirically, SecCodePRM outperforms prior approaches in all three settings, while preserving code functional correctness, suggesting improved security without a safety-utility tradeoff.

Authors: Wayne Chi, Yixiong Fang, Arnav Yayavaram, Siddharth Yayavaram, Seth Karten, Qiuhong Anna Wei, Runkun Chen, Alexander Wang, Valerie Chen, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue

Despite rapid progress on coding agents, progress on their multimodal counterparts has lagged behind. A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%. We release GameDevBench publicly to support further research into agentic game development.

Authors: Samal Mukhtar, Yinghua Yao, Zhu Sun, Mustafa Mustafa, Yew Soon Ong, Youcheng Sun

Software vulnerability detection (SVD) is a critical challenge in modern systems. Large language models (LLMs) offer natural-language explanations alongside predictions, but most work focuses on binary evaluation, and explanations often lack semantic consistency with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability.

Authors: Bo Wang, Yueyang Chen, Jieke Shi, Minghui Li, Yunbo Lyu, Yinan Wu, Youfang Lin, Zhou Yang

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software systems, giving rise to a new class of systems referred to as LLMware. Beyond traditional source-code components, LLMware embeds or interacts with LLMs that depend on other models and datasets, forming complex supply chains across open-source software (OSS), models, and datasets. However, licensing issues emerging from these intertwined dependencies remain largely unexplored. Leveraging GitHub and Hugging Face, we curate a large-scale dataset capturing LLMware supply chains, including 12,180 OSS repositories, 3,988 LLMs, and 708 datasets. Our analysis reveals that license distributions in LLMware differ substantially from traditional OSS ecosystems. We further examine license-related discussions and find that license selection and maintenance are the dominant concerns, accounting for 84% of cases. To understand incompatibility risks, we analyze license conflicts along supply chains and evaluate state-of-the-art detection approaches, which achieve only 58% and 76% F1 scores in this setting. Motivated by these limitations, we propose LiAgent, an LLM-based agent framework for ecosystem-level license compatibility analysis. LiAgent achieves an F1 score of 87%, improving performance by 14 percentage points over prior methods. We reported 60 incompatibility issues detected by LiAgent, 11 of which have been confirmed by developers. Notably, two conflicted LLMs have over 107 million and 5 million downloads on Hugging Face, respectively, indicating potentially widespread downstream impact. We conclude with implications and recommendations to support the sustainable growth of the LLMware ecosystem.

Authors: Hamed Taherkhani, Alireza DaghighFarsoodeh, Mohammad Chowdhury, Hung Viet Pham, Hadi Hemmati

Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced automated test generation, yet existing methods often rely on ground-truth code for verification, risking bug propagation and limiting applicability in test-driven development. We present ConVerTest, a novel two-stage pipeline for synthesizing reliable tests without requiring prior code implementations. ConVerTest integrates three core strategies: (i) Self-Consistency(SC) to generate convergent test cases via majority voting; (ii) Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) for iterative, reasoning-guided code refinement; and (iii) a Dual Execution Agreement to crossvalidate code and tests through consensus. Experiments on BIGCODEBENCH and LESS BASIC PYTHON PROBLEMS (LBPP) benchmarks demonstrate that ConVerTest improves test validity, line coverage, and mutation scores by up to 39%, 28%, and 18% respectively over baselines. Our findings highlight ConVerTest as a robust solution for mitigating hallucinations and enhancing the reliability of autonomous software testing agents.

Authors: Viet Hoang Luu, Amirmohammad Pasdar, Wachiraphan Charoenwet, Toby Murray, Shaanan Cohney, Van-Thuan Pham

Modern fuzzers scale to large, real-world software but often fail to exercise the program states developers consider most fragile or security-critical. Such states are typically deep in the execution space, gated by preconditions, or overshadowed by lower-value paths that consume limited fuzzing budgets. Meanwhile, developers routinely surface risk-relevant insights during code review, yet this information is largely ignored by automated testing tools. We present EyeQ, a system that leverages developer intelligence from code reviews to guide fuzzing. EyeQ extracts security-relevant signals from review discussions, localizes the implicated program regions, and translates these insights into annotation-based guidance for fuzzing. The approach operates atop existing annotation-aware fuzzing, requiring no changes to program semantics or developer workflows. We first validate EyeQ through a human-guided feasibility study on a security-focused dataset of PHP code reviews, establishing a strong baseline for review-guided fuzzing. We then automate the workflow using a large language model with carefully designed prompts. EyeQ significantly improves vulnerability discovery over standard fuzzing configurations, uncovering more than 40 previously unknown bugs in the security-critical PHP codebase.

Authors: Jialiang Wang, Shengxiang Xu, Hanmo Liu, Jiachuan Wang, Yuyu Luo, Shimin Di, Min-Ling Zhang, Lei Chen

Automatically generating agentic workflows -- executable operator graphs or codes that orchestrate reasoning, verification, and repair -- has become a practical way to solve complex tasks beyond what single-pass LLM generation can reliably handle. Yet what constitutes a good workflow depends heavily on the task distribution and the available operators. Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects. Across stringent multi-domain, cross-domain, and unseen-domain evaluations, our 1-pass generator surpasses SOTA refinement baselines that consume 20 iterations, while substantially reducing generation latency and cost.

Authors: Alejandro Mendoza Barrionuevo, Dame Seck Diop, Alejandro Casado Pérez, Daniel Gutiérrez Reina, Sergio L. Toral Marín, Samuel Yanes Luis

The evaluation of informative path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles is often hindered by fragmented execution pipelines and limited transferability between simulation and real-world deployment. This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification. The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline. The approach is validated through a set of experiments, including real-world deployment on an autonomous surface vehicle performing water quality monitoring with real-time sensor feedback.

### 10. [PELLI: Framework to effectively integrate LLMs for quality software generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10808v1)

Authors: Rasmus Krebs, Somnath Mazumdar

Recent studies have revealed that when LLMs are appropriately prompted and configured, they demonstrate mixed results. Such results often meet or exceed the baseline performance. However, these comparisons have two primary issues. First, they mostly considered only reliability as a comparison metric and selected a few LLMs (such as Codex and ChatGPT) for comparision. This paper proposes a comprehensive code quality assessment framework called Programmatic Excellence via LLM Iteration (PELLI). PELLI is an iterative analysis-based process that upholds high-quality code changes. We extended the state-of-the-art by performing a comprehensive evaluation that generates quantitative metrics for analyzing three primary nonfunctional requirements (such as maintainability, performance, and reliability) while selecting five popular LLMs. For PELLI's applicability, we selected three application domains while following Python coding standards. Following this framework, practitioners can ensure harmonious integration between LLMs and human developers, ensuring that their potential is fully realized. PELLI can serve as a practical guide for developers aiming to leverage LLMs while adhering to recognized quality standards. This study's outcomes are crucial for advancing LLM technologies in real-world applications, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of where these LLMs excel and where they require further refinement. Overall, based on three nonfunctional requirements, we have found that GPT-4T and Gemini performed slightly better. We also found that prompt design can influence the overall code quality. In addition, each application domain demonstrated high and low scores across various metrics, and even within the same metrics across different prompts.

Authors: Haoyu Hu, Raja Marjieh, Katherine M Collins, Chenyi Li, Thomas L. Griffiths, Ilia Sucholutsky, Nori Jacoby

Writing code has been one of the most transformative ways for human societies to translate abstract ideas into tangible technologies. Modern AI is transforming this process by enabling experts and non-experts alike to generate code without actually writing code, but instead, through natural language instructions, or "vibe coding". While increasingly popular, the cumulative impact of vibe coding on productivity and collaboration, as well as the role of humans in this process, remains unclear. Here, we introduce a controlled experimental framework for studying collaborative vibe coding and use it to compare human-led, AI-led, and hybrid groups. Across 16 experiments involving 604 human participants, we show that people provide uniquely effective high-level instructions for vibe coding across iterations, whereas AI-provided instructions often result in performance collapse. We further demonstrate that hybrid systems perform best when humans retain directional control (providing the instructions), while evaluation is delegated to AI.

Authors: Song Kim, Hyewon Kim, Kaiqiang Yu, Taejoon Han, Junghoon Kim, Susik Yoon, Jungeun Kim

Discovering large cohesive subgraphs is a key task for graph mining. Existing models, such as clique, k-plex, and γ-quasi-clique, use fixed density thresholds that overlook the natural decay of connectivity as the subgraph size increases. The Flexi-clique model overcomes this limitation by imposing a degree constraint that grows sub-linearly with subgraph size. We provide the algorithmic study of Flexi-clique, proving its NP-hardness and analysing its non-hereditary properties. To address its computational challenge, we propose the Flexi-Prune Algorithm FPA, a fast heuristic using core-based seeding and connectivity-aware pruning, and the Efficient Branch-and-Bound Algorithm EBA, an exact framework enhanced with multiple pruning rules. Experiments on large real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate that FPA achieves near-optimal quality at much lower cost, while EBA efficiently computes exact solutions. Flexi-clique thus provides a practical and scalable model for discovering large, meaningful subgraphs in complex networks.

Authors: Stephan Clémençon, Ekhine Irurozki

In this article we develop a new method for summarizing a ranking distribution, \textit{i.e.} a probability distribution on the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, beyond the classical theory of consensus and Kemeny medians. Based on the notion of \textit{local ranking median}, we introduce the concept of \textit{consensus ranking distribution} ($\crd$), a sparse mixture model of Dirac masses on $\mathfrak{S}_n$, in order to approximate a ranking distribution with small distortion from a mass transportation perspective. We prove that by choosing the popular Kendall $τ$ distance as the cost function, the optimal distortion can be expressed as a function of pairwise probabilities, paving the way for the development of efficient learning methods that do not suffer from the lack of vector space structure on $\mathfrak{S}_n$. In particular, we propose a top-down tree-structured statistical algorithm that allows for the progressive refinement of a CRD based on ranking data, from the Dirac mass at a Kemeny median at the root of the tree to the empirical ranking data distribution itself at the end of the tree's exhaustive growth. In addition to the theoretical arguments developed, the relevance of the algorithm is empirically supported by various numerical experiments.

### 2. [SoftMatcha 2: A Fast and Soft Pattern Matcher for Trillion-Scale Corpora](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10908v1)

Authors: Masataka Yoneda, Yusuke Matsushita, Go Kamoda, Kohei Suenaga, Takuya Akiba, Masaki Waga, Sho Yokoi

We present an ultra-fast and flexible search algorithm that enables search over trillion-scale natural language corpora in under 0.3 seconds while handling semantic variations (substitution, insertion, and deletion). Our approach employs string matching based on suffix arrays that scales well with corpus size. To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025). As a practical application, we demonstrate that our method identifies benchmark contamination in training corpora, unidentified by existing approaches. We also provide an online demo of fast, soft search across corpora in seven languages.

### 3. [Natural Hypergradient Descent: Algorithm Design, Convergence Analysis, and Parallel Implementation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10905v1)

Authors: Deyi Kong, Zaiwei Chen, Shuzhong Zhang, Shancong Mou

In this work, we propose Natural Hypergradient Descent (NHGD), a new method for solving bilevel optimization problems. To address the computational bottleneck in hypergradient estimation--namely, the need to compute or approximate Hessian inverse--we exploit the statistical structure of the inner optimization problem and use the empirical Fisher information matrix as an asymptotically consistent surrogate for the Hessian. This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead. Empirical evaluations on representative bilevel learning tasks further demonstrate the practical advantages of NHGD, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in large-scale machine learning settings.

Authors: Charlotte Cambier van Nooten, Christos Aronis, Yuliya Shapovalova, Lucia Cavallaro

This paper explores sparsification methods as a form of regularization in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address high memory usage and computational costs in large-scale graph applications. Using techniques from Network Science and Machine Learning, including Erdős-Rényi for model sparsification, we enhance the efficiency of GNNs for real-world applications. We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis.

### 5. [Bayesian Inference of Contextual Bandit Policies via Empirical Likelihood](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10608v1)

Authors: Jiangrong Ouyang, Mingming Gong, Howard Bondell

Policy inference plays an essential role in the contextual bandit problem. In this paper, we use empirical likelihood to develop a Bayesian inference method for the joint analysis of multiple contextual bandit policies in finite sample regimes. The proposed inference method is robust to small sample sizes and is able to provide accurate uncertainty measurements for policy value evaluation. In addition, it allows for flexible inferences on policy comparison with full uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed inference method using Monte Carlo simulations and its application to an adolescent body mass index data set.

### 6. [Deep Bootstrap](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10587v1)

Authors: Jinyuan Chang, Yuling Jiao, Lican Kang, Junjie Shi

In this work, we propose a novel deep bootstrap framework for nonparametric regression based on conditional diffusion models. Specifically, we construct a conditional diffusion model to learn the distribution of the response variable given the covariates. This model is then used to generate bootstrap samples by pairing the original covariates with newly synthesized responses. We reformulate nonparametric regression as conditional sample mean estimation, which is implemented directly via the learned conditional diffusion model. Unlike traditional bootstrap methods that decouple the estimation of the conditional distribution, sampling, and nonparametric regression, our approach integrates these components into a unified generative framework. With the expressive capacity of diffusion models, our method facilitates both efficient sampling from high-dimensional or multimodal distributions and accurate nonparametric estimation. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for the proposed method. In particular, we derive optimal end-to-end convergence rates in the Wasserstein distance between the learned and target conditional distributions. Building on this foundation, we further establish the convergence guarantees of the resulting bootstrap procedure. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach for complex regression tasks.

### 7. [Generalized Robust Adaptive-Bandwidth Multi-View Manifold Learning in High Dimensions with Noise](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10530v1)

Authors: Xiucai Ding, Chao Shen, Hau-Tieng Wu

Multiview datasets are common in scientific and engineering applications, yet existing fusion methods offer limited theoretical guarantees, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous and high-dimensional noise. We propose Generalized Robust Adaptive-Bandwidth Multiview Diffusion Maps (GRAB-MDM), a new kernel-based diffusion geometry framework for integrating multiple noisy data sources. The key innovation of GRAB-MDM is a {view}-dependent bandwidth selection strategy that adapts to the geometry and noise level of each view, enabling a stable and principled construction of multiview diffusion operators. Under a common-manifold model, we establish asymptotic convergence results and show that the adaptive bandwidths lead to provably robust recovery of the shared intrinsic structure, even when noise levels and sensor dimensions differ across views. Numerical experiments demonstrate that GRAB-MDM significantly improves robustness and embedding quality compared with fixed-bandwidth and equal-bandwidth baselines, and usually outperform existing algorithms. The proposed framework offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for multiview sensor fusion in high-dimensional noisy environments.

### 8. [Weighting-Based Identification and Estimation in Graphical Models of Missing Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10969v1)

Authors: Anna Guo, Razieh Nabi

We propose a constructive algorithm for identifying complete data distributions in graphical models of missing data. The complete data distribution is unrestricted, while the missingness mechanism is assumed to factorize according to a conditional directed acyclic graph. Our approach follows an interventionist perspective in which missingness indicators are treated as variables that can be intervened on. A central challenge in this setting is that sequences of interventions on missingness indicators may induce and propagate selection bias, so that identification can fail even when a propensity score is invariant to available interventions. To address this challenge, we introduce a tree-based identification algorithm that explicitly tracks the creation and propagation of selection bias and determines whether it can be avoided through admissible intervention strategies. The resulting tree provides both a diagnostic and a constructive characterization of identifiability under a given missingness mechanism. Building on these results, we develop recursive inverse probability weighting procedures that mirror the intervention logic of the identification algorithm, yielding valid estimating equations for both the missingness mechanism and functionals of the complete data distribution. Simulation studies and a real-data application illustrate the practical performance of the proposed methods. An accompanying R package, flexMissing, implements all proposed procedures.

### 9. [TRACE: Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10588v1)

Authors: Hosein Anjidani, S. Yahya S. R. Tehrani, Mohammad Mahdi Mojahedian, Mohammad Hossein Yassaee

When a source-trained model $Q$ is replaced by a model $\tilde{Q}$ trained on shifted data, its performance on the source domain can change unpredictably. To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $ΔR := R_P(\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|ΔR|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|ΔR|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement.

### 10. [Fast and Large-Scale Unbalanced Optimal Transport via its Semi-Dual and Adaptive Gradient Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10697v1)

Authors: Ferdinand Genans

Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) has emerged as a robust relaxation of standard Optimal Transport, particularly effective for handling outliers and mass variations. However, scalable algorithms for UOT, specifically those based on Gradient Descent (SGD), remain largely underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by analyzing the semi-dual formulation of Entropic UOT and demonstrating its suitability for adaptive gradient methods. While the semi-dual is a standard tool for large-scale balanced OT, its geometry in the unbalanced setting appears ill-conditioned under standard analysis. Specifically, worst-case bounds on the marginal penalties using $χ^2$ divergence suggest a condition number scaling with $n/\varepsilon$, implying poor scalability. In contrast, we show that the local condition number actually scales as $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$, effectively removing the ill-conditioned dependence on $n$. Exploiting this property, we prove that SGD methods adapt to this local curvature, achieving a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(n/\varepsilon T)$ in the stochastic and online regimes, making it suitable for large-scale and semi-discrete applications. Finally, for the full batch discrete setting, we derive a nearly tight upper bound on local smoothness depending solely on the gradient. Using it to adapt step sizes, we propose a modified Adaptive Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (ANAG) method on the semi-dual functional and prove that it achieves a local complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2\sqrt{1/\varepsilon}\ln(1/δ))$.

### 1. [Rethinking the Design Space of Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Models: On the Importance of Likelihood Estimation Beyond Loss Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04663v1)

Authors: Jaemoo Choi, Yuchen Zhu, Wei Guo, Petr Molodyk, Bo Yuan, Jinbin Bai, Yi Xin, Molei Tao, Yongxin Chen

Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to diffusion and flow models for visual tasks such as text-to-image generation. However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.

### 2. [RexBERT: Context Specialized Bidirectional Encoders for E-commerce](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04605v1)

Authors: Rahul Bajaj, Anuj Garg

Encoder-only transformers remain indispensable in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems where latency, stability, and cost are paramount. Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.

### 3. [BrainVista: Modeling Naturalistic Brain Dynamics as Multimodal Next-Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04512v1)

Authors: Xuanhua Yin, Runkai Zhao, Lina Yao, Weidong Cai

Naturalistic fMRI characterizes the brain as a dynamic predictive engine driven by continuous sensory streams. However, modeling the causal forward evolution in realistic neural simulation is impeded by the timescale mismatch between multimodal inputs and the complex topology of cortical networks. To address these challenges, we introduce BrainVista, a multimodal autoregressive framework designed to model the causal evolution of brain states. BrainVista incorporates Network-wise Tokenizers to disentangle system-specific dynamics and a Spatial Mixer Head that captures inter-network information flow without compromising functional boundaries. Furthermore, we propose a novel Stimulus-to-Brain (S2B) masking mechanism to synchronize high-frequency sensory stimuli with hemodynamically filtered signals, enabling strict, history-only causal conditioning. We validate our framework on Algonauts 2025, CineBrain, and HAD, achieving state-of-the-art fMRI encoding performance. In long-horizon rollout settings, our model yields substantial improvements over baselines, increasing pattern correlation by 36.0\% and 33.3\% on relative to the strongest baseline Algonauts 2025 and CineBrain, respectively.

### 4. [Is Micro Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training Effective for Real-World Operations? Multi-Step Evaluation Reveals Potential and Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04466v1)

Authors: Masaya Tsunokake, Yuta Koreeda, Terufumi Morishita, Koichi Nagatsuka, Hikaru Tomonari, Yasuhiro Sogawa

When applying LLMs to real-world enterprise operations, LLMs need to handle proprietary knowledge in small domains of specific operations ($\textbf{micro domains}$). A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.

### 5. [Improving 2D Diffusion Models for 3D Medical Imaging with Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04162v1)

Authors: Chenhe Du, Qing Wu, Xuanyu Tian, Jingyi Yu, Hongjiang Wei, Yuyao Zhang

3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

### 6. [Toward Effective Multimodal Graph Foundation Model: A Divide-and-Conquer Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04116v1)

Authors: Sicheng Liu, Xunkai Li, Daohan Su, Ru Zhang, Hongchao Qin, Ronghua Li, Guoren Wang

Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have achieved remarkable success in generalizing across diverse domains. However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.

### 7. [SPEAR: An Engineering Case Study of Multi-Agent Coordination for Smart Contract Auditing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04418v1)

Authors: Arnab Mallick, Indraveni Chebolu, Harmesh Rana

We present SPEAR, a multi-agent coordination framework for smart contract auditing that applies established MAS patterns in a realistic security analysis workflow. SPEAR models auditing as a coordinated mission carried out by specialized agents: a Planning Agent prioritizes contracts using risk-aware heuristics, an Execution Agent allocates tasks via the Contract Net protocol, and a Repair Agent autonomously recovers from brittle generated artifacts using a programmatic-first repair policy. Agents maintain local beliefs updated through AGM-compliant revision, coordinate via negotiation and auction protocols, and revise plans as new information becomes available. An empirical study compares the multi-agent design with centralized and pipeline-based alternatives under controlled failure scenarios, focusing on coordination, recovery behavior, and resource use.

### 8. [Med-MMFL: A Multimodal Federated Learning Benchmark in Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04416v1)

Authors: Aavash Chhetri, Bibek Niroula, Pratik Shrestha, Yash Raj Shrestha, Lesley A Anderson, Prashnna K Gyawali, Loris Bazzani, Binod Bhattarai

Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized medical institutions while preserving data privacy. However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity. We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks. To support reproducibility and fair comparison of future multimodal federated learning (MMFL) methods under realistic medical settings, we release the complete benchmark implementation, including data processing and partitioning pipelines, at https://github.com/bhattarailab/Med-MMFL-Benchmark .

### 9. [Performative Learning Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04402v1)

Authors: Julian Rodemann, Unai Fischer-Abaigar, James Bailie, Krikamol Muandet

Performative predictions influence the very outcomes they aim to forecast. We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples. We illustrate our bounds in a case study on prediction-informed assignments of unemployed German residents to job trainings, drawing upon administrative labor market records from 1975 to 2017 in Germany.

### 10. [Blockchain Federated Learning for Sustainable Retail: Reducing Waste through Collaborative Demand Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04384v1)

Authors: Fabio Turazza, Alessandro Neri, Marcello Pietri, Maria Angela Butturi, Marco Picone, Marco Mamei

Effective demand forecasting is crucial for reducing food waste. However, data privacy concerns often hinder collaboration among retailers, limiting the potential for improved predictive accuracy. In this study, we explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), with a focus on the grocery retail sector dealing with perishable goods. We develop a baseline predictive model for demand forecasting and waste assessment in an isolated retailer scenario. Subsequently, we introduce a Blockchain-based FL model, trained collaboratively across multiple retailers without direct data sharing. Our preliminary results show that FL models have performance almost equivalent to the ideal setting in which parties share data with each other, and are notably superior to models built by individual parties without sharing data, cutting waste and boosting efficiency.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [Harmonia: Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design for Memory- and Compute-Efficient BFP-based LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04595v1)

Authors: Xinyu Wang, Jieyu Li, Yanan Sun, Weifeng He

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but incur high memory and computation costs. Quantization is an effective solution, with INT weights and FP activations being widely adopted to preserve accuracy. Prior works further reduce FP overhead by using block floating point (BFP) activations in linear layers, but fail to extend BFP to attention layers due to severe accuracy degradation, limiting overall efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Harmonia, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that enables all-layer BFP activations with a configurable hardware architecture. First, we systematically explore BFP configurations to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and activation compression across all layers. Second, to reduce KV-cache storage and computation in attention layers, we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy and computations in attention layers,we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy combined with a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing technique. This allow aggressive KV-cache compression from FP16 to 4-bit-mantissa BFP with only 0.3% average accuracy loss. Third, to fully exploit all-layer BFP activations, we design dedicated hardware components, including a reconfigurable PE supporting mixed data formats (BFP-INT and BPF-BFP), a real-time FP16-to-BFP converter, and a tiling-aware dataflow to reduce memory traffic. We evaluate Harmonia on GEMM operations in both linear and attention layers across eight widely used LLMs. Compared with prior works, Harmonia achieves 3.84x (up to 5.05x) higher area efficiency, 2.03x (up to 3.90x) better energy efficiency, and 3.08x (up to 4.62x) speedup on average.

### 2. [SPPAM: Signature Pattern Prediction and Access-Map Prefetcher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04100v1)

Authors: Maccoy Merrell, Lei Wang, Stavros Kalafatis, Paul V. Gratz

The discrepancy between processor speed and memory system performance continues to limit the performance of many workloads. To address the issue, one effective and well studied technique is cache prefetching. Many prefetching designs have been proposed, with varying approaches and effectiveness. For example, SPP is a popular prefetcher that leverages confidence throttled recursion to speculate on the future path of program's references, however it is very susceptible to the reference reordering of higher-level caches and the OoO core. Orthogonally, AMPM is another popular approach to prefetching which uses reordering-resistant access maps to identify patterns within a region, but is unable to speculate beyond that region. In this paper, we propose SPPAM, a new approach to prefetching, inspired by prior works such as SPP and AMPM, while addressing their limitations. SPPAM utilizes online-learning to build a set of access-map patterns. These patterns are used in a speculative lookahead which is throttled by a confidence metric. Targeting the second-level cache, SPPAM alongside state-of-the-art prefetchers Berti and Bingo improve system performance by 31.4% over no prefetching and 6.2% over the baseline of Berti and Pythia.

### 3. [Crypto-RV: High-Efficiency FPGA-Based RISC-V Cryptographic Co-Processor for IoT Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04415v1)

Authors: Anh Kiet Pham, Van Truong Vo, Vu Trung Duong Le, Tuan Hai Vu, Hoai Luan Pham, Van Tinh Nguyen, Yasuhiko Nakashima

Cryptographic operations are critical for securing IoT, edge computing, and autonomous systems. However, current RISC-V platforms lack efficient hardware support for comprehensive cryptographic algorithm families and post-quantum cryptography. This paper presents Crypto-RV, a RISC-V co-processor architecture that unifies support for SHA-256, SHA-512, SM3, SHA3-256, SHAKE-128, SHAKE-256 AES-128, HARAKA-256, and HARAKA-512 within a single 64-bit datapath. Crypto-RV introduces three key architectural innovations: a high-bandwidth internal buffer (128x64-bit), cryptography-specialized execution units with four-stage pipelined datapaths, and a double-buffering mechanism with adaptive scheduling optimized for large-hash. Implemented on Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA at 160 MHz with 0.851 W dynamic power, Crypto-RV achieves 165 times to 1,061 times speedup over baseline RISC-V cores, 5.8 times to 17.4 times better energy efficiency compared to powerful CPUs. The design occupies only 34,704 LUTs, 37,329 FFs, and 22 BRAMs demonstrating viability for high-performance, energy-efficient cryptographic processing in resource-constrained IoT environments.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [On the Complexity of Vertex-Splitting Into an Interval Graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04628v1)

Authors: Faisal N. Abu-Khzam, Dipayan Chakraborty, Lucas Isenmann, Nacim Oijid

Vertex splitting is a graph modification operation in which a vertex is replaced by multiple vertices such that the union of their neighborhoods equals the neighborhood of the original vertex. We introduce and study vertex splitting as a graph modification operation for transforming graphs into interval graphs. Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, we consider the problem of deciding whether $G$ can be transformed into an interval graph using at most $k$ vertex splits. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, even when the input is restricted to subcubic planar bipartite graphs. We further observe that vertex splitting differs fundamentally from vertex and edge deletions as graph modification operations when the objective is to obtain a chordal graph, even for graphs with maximum independent set size at most two. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for transforming, via a minimum number of vertex splits, a given graph into a disjoint union of paths, and that splitting triangle free graphs into unit interval graphs is also solvable in polynomial time.

### 2. [Quantum Advantage in Decision Trees: A Weighted Graph and $L_1$ Norm Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04700v1)

Authors: Sebastian Alberto Grillo, Bernardo Daniel Dávalos, Rodney Fabian Franco Torres, Franklin de Lima Marquezino, Edgar López Pezoa

The analysis of the computational power of single-query quantum algorithms is important because they must extract maximal information from one oracle call, revealing fundamental limits of quantum advantage and enabling optimal, resource-efficient quantum computation. This paper proposes a formulation of single-query quantum decision trees as weighted graphs. This formulation has the advantage that it facilitates the analysis of the $L_1$ spectral norm of the algorithm output. This advantage is based on the fact that a high $L_1$ spectral norm of the output of a quantum decision tree is a necessary condition to outperform its classical counterpart. We propose heuristics for maximizing the $L_{1}$ spectral norm, show how to combine weighted graphs to generate sequences with strictly increasing norm, and present functions exhibiting exponential quantum advantage. Finally, we establish a necessary condition linking single-query quantum advantage to the asymptotic growth of measurement projector dimensions.

### 3. [The Complexity of Min-Max Optimization with Product Constraints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04665v1)

Authors: Martino Bernasconi, Matteo Castiglioni

We study the computational complexity of the problem of computing local min-max equilibria of games with a nonconvex-nonconcave utility function $f$. From the work of Daskalakis, Skoulakis, and Zampetakis [DSZ21], this problem was known to be hard in the restrictive case in which players are required to play strategies that are jointly constrained, leaving open the question of its complexity under more natural constraints. In this paper, we settle the question and show that the problem is PPAD-hard even under product constraints and, in particular, over the hypercube.

### Computational Engineering

### 1. [An Efficient Bayesian Framework for Inverse Problems via Optimization and Inversion: Surrogate Modeling, Parameter Inference, and Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04537v1)

Authors: Mihaela Chiappetta, Massimo Carraturo, Alexander Raßloff, Markus Kästner, Ferdinando Auricchio

The present paper proposes a Bayesian framework for inverse problems that seamlessly integrates optimization and inversion to enable rapid surrogate modeling, accurate parameter inference, and rigorous uncertainty quantification. Bayesian optimization is employed to adaptively construct accurate Gaussian process surrogate models using a minimal number of high-fidelity model evaluations, strategically focusing sampling in regions of high predictive uncertainty. The trained surrogate model is then leveraged within a Bayesian inversion scheme to infer optimal parameter values by combining prior knowledge with observed quantities of interest, resulting in posterior distributions that rigorously characterize epistemic uncertainty. The framework is theoretically grounded, computationally efficient, and particularly suited for engineering applications in which high-fidelity models -- whether arising from numerical simulations or physical experiments -- are computationally expensive, analytically intractable, or difficult to replicate, and data availability is limited. Furthermore, the combined use of Bayesian optimization and inversion outperforms their separate application, highlighting the synergistic benefits of unifying the two approaches. The performance of the proposed Bayesian framework is demonstrated on a suite of one- and two-dimensional analytical benchmarks, including the Mixed Gaussian-Periodic, Lévy, Griewank, Forrester, and Rosenbrock functions, which provide a controlled setting to assess surrogate modeling accuracy, parameter inference robustness, and uncertainty quantification. The results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in efficiently solving inverse problems while providing informative uncertainty quantification and supporting reliable engineering decision-making at reduced computational cost.

### 2. [OSCAgent: Accelerating the Discovery of Organic Solar Cells with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04510v1)

Authors: Zhaolin Hu, Zhiliang Wu, Hehe Fan, Yi Yang

Organic solar cells (OSCs) hold great promise for sustainable energy, but discovering high-performance materials is time-consuming and costly. Existing molecular generation methods can aid the design of OSC molecules, but they are mostly confined to optimizing known backbones and lack effective use of domain-specific chemical knowledge, often leading to unrealistic candidates. In this paper, we introduce OSCAgent, a multi-agent framework for OSC molecular discovery that unifies retrieval-augmented design, molecular generation, and systematic evaluation into a continuously improving pipeline, without requiring additional human intervention. OSCAgent comprises three collaborative agents. The Planner retrieves knowledge from literature-curated molecules and prior candidates to guide design directions. The Generator proposes new OSC acceptors aligned with these plans. The Experimenter performs comprehensive evaluation of candidate molecules and provides feedback for refinement. Experiments show that OSCAgent produces chemically valid, synthetically accessible OSC molecules and achieves superior predicted performance compared to both traditional and large language model (LLM)-only baselines. Representative results demonstrate that some candidates achieve predicted efficiencies approaching 18\%. The code will be publicly available.

### Computation and Language

### 1. [Fine-Grained Activation Steering: Steering Less, Achieving More](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04428v1)

Authors: Zijian Feng, Tianjiao Li, Zixiao Zhu, Hanzhang Zhou, Junlang Qian, Li Zhang, Jia Jim Deryl Chua, Lee Onn Mak, Gee Wah Ng, Kezhi Mao

Activation steering has emerged as a cost-effective paradigm for modifying large language model (LLM) behaviors. Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more.

### 2. [Tokenization and Morphological Fidelity in Uralic NLP: A Cross-Lingual Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04241v1)

Authors: Nuo Xu, Ahrii Kim

Subword tokenization critically affects Natural Language Processing (NLP) performance, yet its behavior in morphologically rich and low-resource language families remains under-explored. This study systematically compares three subword paradigms -- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), Overlap BPE (OBPE), and Unigram Language Model -- across six Uralic languages with varying resource availability and typological diversity. Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a controlled downstream task, we show that OBPE consistently achieves stronger morphological alignment and higher tagging accuracy than conventional methods, particularly within the Latin-script group. These gains arise from reduced fragmentation in open-class categories and a better balance across the frequency spectrum. Transfer efficacy further depends on the downstream tagging architecture, interacting with both training volume and genealogical proximity. Taken together, these findings highlight that morphology-sensitive tokenization is not merely a preprocessing choice but a decisive factor in enabling effective cross-lingual transfer for agglutinative, low-resource languages.

### 3. [LinGO: A Linguistic Graph Optimization Framework with LLMs for Interpreting Intents of Online Uncivil Discourse](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04693v1)

Authors: Yuan Zhang, Thales Bertaglia

Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.

### 4. [RexBERT: Context Specialized Bidirectional Encoders for E-commerce](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04605v1)

Authors: Rahul Bajaj, Anuj Garg

Encoder-only transformers remain indispensable in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems where latency, stability, and cost are paramount. Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.

### 5. [Deconstructing sentence disambiguation by joint latent modeling of reading paradigms: LLM surprisal is not enough](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04489v1)

Authors: Dario Paape, Tal Linzen, Shravan Vasishth

Using temporarily ambiguous garden-path sentences ("While the team trained the striker wondered ...") as a test case, we present a latent-process mixture model of human reading behavior across four different reading paradigms (eye tracking, uni- and bidirectional self-paced reading, Maze). The model distinguishes between garden-path probability, garden-path cost, and reanalysis cost, and yields more realistic processing cost estimates by taking into account trials with inattentive reading. We show that the model is able to reproduce empirical patterns with regard to rereading behavior, comprehension question responses, and grammaticality judgments. Cross-validation reveals that the mixture model also has better predictive fit to human reading patterns and end-of-trial task data than a mixture-free model based on GPT-2-derived surprisal values. We discuss implications for future work.

### 6. [Is Micro Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training Effective for Real-World Operations? Multi-Step Evaluation Reveals Potential and Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04466v1)

Authors: Masaya Tsunokake, Yuta Koreeda, Terufumi Morishita, Koichi Nagatsuka, Hikaru Tomonari, Yasuhiro Sogawa

When applying LLMs to real-world enterprise operations, LLMs need to handle proprietary knowledge in small domains of specific operations ($\textbf{micro domains}$). A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.

Authors: Chien-Chun Wang, Hung-Shin Lee, Hsin-Min Wang, Berlin Chen

Pre-trained models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech enhancement (SE) have exhibited remarkable capabilities under matched noise and channel conditions. However, these models often suffer from severe performance degradation when confronted with domain shifts, particularly in the presence of unseen noise and channel distortions. In view of this, we in this paper present URSA-GAN, a unified and domain-aware generative framework specifically designed to mitigate mismatches in both noise and channel conditions. URSA-GAN leverages a dual-embedding architecture that consists of a noise encoder and a channel encoder, each pre-trained with limited in-domain data to capture domain-relevant representations. These embeddings condition a GAN-based speech generator, facilitating the synthesis of speech that is acoustically aligned with the target domain while preserving phonetic content. To enhance generalization further, we propose dynamic stochastic perturbation, a novel regularization technique that introduces controlled variability into the embeddings during generation, promoting robustness to unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that URSA-GAN effectively reduces character error rates in ASR and improves perceptual metrics in SE across diverse noisy and mismatched channel scenarios. Notably, evaluations on compound test conditions with both channel and noise degradations confirm the generalization ability of URSA-GAN, yielding relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics.

Authors: Takanori Ashihara, Shota Horiguchi, Kohei Matsuura, Tsubasa Ochiai, Marc Delcroix

Discretized representations of speech signals are efficient alternatives to continuous features for various speech applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech language models. However, these representations, such as semantic or phonetic tokens derived from clustering outputs of self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, are susceptible to environmental noise, which can degrade backend task performance. In this work, we introduce a frontend system that estimates clean speech tokens from noisy speech and evaluate it on an ASR backend using semantic tokens. We consider four types of enhancement models based on their input/output domains: wave-to-wave, token-to-token, continuous SSL features-to-token, and wave-to-token. These models are trained independently of ASR backends. Experiments on the CHiME-4 dataset demonstrate that wave-to-token enhancement achieves the best performance among the frontends. Moreover, it mostly outperforms the ASR system based on continuous SSL features.

Authors: Penghui Qi, Xiangxin Zhou, Zichen Liu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Min Lin, Wee Sun Lee

Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.

### 10. [Decomposed Prompting Does Not Fix Knowledge Gaps, But Helps Models Say "I Don't Know"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04853v1)

Authors: Dhruv Madhwal, Lyuxin David Zhang, Dan Roth, Tomer Wolfson, Vivek Gupta

Large language models often struggle to recognize their knowledge limits in closed-book question answering, leading to confident hallucinations. While decomposed prompting is typically used to improve accuracy, we investigate its impact on reliability. We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning. Our results show that disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty baselines as an error detector, improving both F1 and AUROC across settings. This demonstrates that decomposition-based prompting can serve as a practical diagnostic probe for model reliability in closed-book QA.

Authors: Fabio Turazza, Alessandro Neri, Marcello Pietri, Maria Angela Butturi, Marco Picone, Marco Mamei

Effective demand forecasting is crucial for reducing food waste. However, data privacy concerns often hinder collaboration among retailers, limiting the potential for improved predictive accuracy. In this study, we explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), with a focus on the grocery retail sector dealing with perishable goods. We develop a baseline predictive model for demand forecasting and waste assessment in an isolated retailer scenario. Subsequently, we introduce a Blockchain-based FL model, trained collaboratively across multiple retailers without direct data sharing. Our preliminary results show that FL models have performance almost equivalent to the ideal setting in which parties share data with each other, and are notably superior to models built by individual parties without sharing data, cutting waste and boosting efficiency.

Authors: Vipin Kumar Rathi, Lakshya Chopra, Nikhil Kumar Rajput

Cloud-native application platforms and latency-sensitive systems such as 5G Core networks rely heavily on certificate-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and mutual TLS to secure service-to-service communication. While effective, this model introduces significant operational and performance overhead, which is further amplified in the post-quantum setting due to large certificates and expensive signature verification. In this paper, we present a certificate-free authentication framework for private distributed systems based on post-quantum Identity-Based Encryption(IBE). Our design replaces certificate and signature based authentication with identity-derived keys and identity-based key encapsulation, enabling mutually authenticated TLS connections without certificate transmission or validation. We describe an IBE-based replacement for private PKI, including identity lifecycle management, and show how it can be instantiated using a threshold Private Key Generator (T-PKG). We apply this framework to cloud-native application deployments and latency-sensitive 5G Core networks. In particular, we demonstrate how identity-based TLS integrates with the 5G Service-Based Architecture while preserving security semantics and 3GPP requirements, and we show how the same architecture can replace private PKI in Kubernetes, including its control plane, without disrupting existing trust domains or deployment models.

Authors: Nikolas Melissaris, Jiayi Xu, Antigoni Polychroniadou, Akira Takahashi, Chenkai Weng

Gradient boosted decision trees, particularly XGBoost, are among the most effective methods for tabular data. As deployment in sensitive settings increases, cryptographic guarantees of model integrity become essential. We present ZKBoost, the first zero-knowledge proof of training (zkPoT) protocol for XGBoost, enabling model owners to prove correct training on a committed dataset without revealing data or parameters. We make three key contributions: (1) a fixed-point XGBoost implementation compatible with arithmetic circuits, enabling instantiation of efficient zkPoT, (2) a generic template of zkPoT for XGBoost, which can be instantiated with any general-purpose ZKP backend, and (3) vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE)-based instantiation resolving challenges in proving nonlinear fixed-point operations. Our fixed-point implementation matches standard XGBoost accuracy within 1\% while enabling practical zkPoT on real-world datasets.

Authors: Anneliese Riess, Juan Felipe Gomez, Flavio du Pin Calmon, Julia Anne Schnabel, Georgios Kaissis

We prove the conjecture stated in Appendix F.3 of [Zhu et al. (2022)]: among all conversion rules that map a Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP) profile $τ\mapsto ρ(τ)$ to a valid hypothesis-testing trade-off $f$, the rule based on the intersection of single-order RDP privacy regions is optimal. This optimality holds simultaneously for all valid RDP profiles and for all Type I error levels $α$. Concretely, we show that in the space of trade-off functions, the tightest possible bound is $f_{ρ(\cdot)}(α) = \sup_{τ\geq 0.5} f_{τ,ρ(τ)}(α)$: the pointwise maximum of the single-order bounds for each RDP privacy region. Our proof unifies and sharpens the insights of [Balle et al. (2019)], [Asoodeh et al. (2021)], and [Zhu et al. (2022)]. Our analysis relies on a precise geometric characterization of the RDP privacy region, leveraging its convexity and the fact that its boundary is determined exclusively by Bernoulli mechanisms. Our results establish that the "intersection-of-RDP-privacy-regions" rule is not only valid, but optimal: no other black-box conversion can uniformly dominate it in the Blackwell sense, marking the fundamental limit of what can be inferred about a mechanism's privacy solely from its RDP guarantees.

### 5. [How Few-shot Demonstrations Affect Prompt-based Defenses Against LLM Jailbreak Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04294v1)

Authors: Yanshu Wang, Shuaishuai Yang, Jingjing He, Tong Yang

Large Language Models (LLMs) face increasing threats from jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment. While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in real-world LLM applications.

### 6. [Semantic Consensus Decoding: Backdoor Defense for Verilog Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04195v1)

Authors: Guang Yang, Xing Hu, Xiang Chen, Xin Xia

Large language models (LLMs) for Verilog code generation are increasingly adopted in hardware design, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks where adversaries inject malicious triggers during training to induce vulnerable hardware designs. Unlike patchable software vulnerabilities, hardware trojans become irreversible once fabricated, making remediation extremely costly or impossible. Existing active defenses require access to training data, impractical for third-party LLM users, while passive defenses struggle against semantically stealthy triggers that naturally blend into design specifications. In this paper, we hypothesize that under the requirements of both effectiveness and stealthiness, attackers are strongly biased toward embedding triggers in non-functional requirements (e.g., style modifiers, quality descriptors) rather than functional specifications that determine hardware behavior. Exploiting this insight, we propose Semantic Consensus Decoding (SCD), an inference-time passive defense with two key components: (1) functional requirement extraction that identifies essential requirements from user specifications, and (2) consensus decoding that adaptively fuses output distributions based on full user specifications and extracted functional requirements. When these distributions diverge significantly, SCD automatically suppresses suspicious components. Extensive experiments with three representative backdoor attacks demonstrate that SCD reduces average attack success rate from 89% to under 3% with negligible impact on generation quality.

Quantum mechanics provides cryptographic primitives whose security is grounded in hardness assumptions independent of those underlying classical cryptography. However, existing proposals require low-noise quantum communication and long-lived quantum memory, capabilities which remain challenging to realize in practice. In this work, we introduce a quantum digital signature scheme that operates with only classical communication, using the classical shadows of states produced by random circuits as public keys. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence supporting the conjectured hardness of learning the private key (the circuit) from the public key (the shadow). A key technical ingredient enabling our scheme is an improved state-certification primitive that achieves higher noise tolerance and lower sample complexity than prior methods. We realize this certification by designing a high-rate error-detecting code tailored to our random-circuit ensemble and experimentally generating shadows for 32-qubit states using circuits with $\geq 80$ logical ($\geq 582$ physical) two-qubit gates, attaining 0.90 $\pm$ 0.01 fidelity. With increased number of measurement samples, our hardware-demonstrated primitives realize a proof-of-principle quantum digital signature, demonstrating the near-term feasibility of our scheme.

Authors: Amir Nuriyev, Gabriel Kulp

We present a text-reconstruction attack on mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models that recovers tokens from expert selections alone. In MoE models, each token is routed to a subset of expert subnetworks; we show these routing decisions leak substantially more information than previously understood. Prior work using logistic regression achieves limited reconstruction; we show that a 3-layer MLP improves this to 63.1% top-1 accuracy, and that a transformer-based sequence decoder recovers 91.2% of tokens top-1 (94.8% top-10) on 32-token sequences from OpenWebText after training on 100M tokens. These results connect MoE routing to the broader literature on embedding inversion. We outline practical leakage scenarios (e.g., distributed inference and side channels) and show that adding noise reduces but does not eliminate reconstruction. Our findings suggest that expert selections in MoE deployments should be treated as sensitive as the underlying text.

Motivated by applications in cybersecurity such as finding meaningful sequences of malware-related events buried inside large amounts of computer log data, we introduce the "planted path" problem and propose an algorithm to find fuzzy matchings between two trees. This algorithm can be used as a "building block" for more complicated workflows. We demonstrate usefulness of a few of such workflows in mining synthetically generated data as well as real-world ACME cybersecurity datasets.

Authors: Ariel Fogel, Omer Hofman, Eilon Cohen, Roman Vainshtein

Open-weight language models are increasingly used in production settings, raising new security challenges. One prominent threat in this context is backdoor attacks, in which adversaries embed hidden behaviors in language models that activate under specific conditions. Previous work has assumed that adversaries have access to training pipelines or deployment infrastructure. We propose a novel attack surface requiring neither, which utilizes the chat template. Chat templates are executable Jinja2 programs invoked at every inference call, occupying a privileged position between user input and model processing. We show that an adversary who distributes a model with a maliciously modified template can implant an inference-time backdoor without modifying model weights, poisoning training data, or controlling runtime infrastructure. We evaluated this attack vector by constructing template backdoors targeting two objectives: degrading factual accuracy and inducing emission of attacker-controlled URLs, and applied them across eighteen models spanning seven families and four inference engines. Under triggered conditions, factual accuracy drops from 90% to 15% on average while attacker-controlled URLs are emitted with success rates exceeding 80%; benign inputs show no measurable degradation. Backdoors generalize across inference runtimes and evade all automated security scans applied by the largest open-weight distribution platform. These results establish chat templates as a reliable and currently undefended attack surface in the LLM supply chain.

Authors: Haokui Zhang, Congyang Ou, Dawei Yan, Peng Wang, Qingsen Yan, Ying Li, Rong Xiao, Chunhua Shen

Recently, reducing redundant visual tokens in vision-language models (VLMs) to accelerate VLM inference has emerged as a hot topic. However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

Authors: Raúl Jiménez Cruz, César Torres-Huitzil, Marco Franceschetti, Ronny Seiger, Luciano García-Bañuelos, Barbara Weber

This data article presents a dataset of 11,884 labeled images documenting a simulated blood extraction (phlebotomy) procedure performed on a training arm. Images were extracted from high-definition videos recorded under controlled conditions and curated to reduce redundancy using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) filtering. An automated face-anonymization step was applied to all videos prior to frame selection. Each image contains polygon annotations for five medically relevant classes: syringe, rubber band, disinfectant wipe, gloves, and training arm. The annotations were exported in a segmentation format compatible with modern object detection frameworks (e.g., YOLOv8), ensuring broad usability. This dataset is partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) subsets and is designed to advance research in medical training automation and human-object interaction. It enables multiple applications, including phlebotomy tool detection, procedural step recognition, workflow analysis, conformance checking, and the development of educational systems that provide structured feedback to medical trainees. The data and accompanying label files are publicly available on Zenodo.

Authors: Byungwoo Jeon, Yoonwoo Jeong, Hyunseok Lee, Minsu Cho, Jinwoo Shin

Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.

Authors: Chenhe Du, Qing Wu, Xuanyu Tian, Jingyi Yu, Hongjiang Wei, Yuyao Zhang

3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

Authors: Aavash Chhetri, Bibek Niroula, Pratik Shrestha, Yash Raj Shrestha, Lesley A Anderson, Prashnna K Gyawali, Loris Bazzani, Binod Bhattarai

Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized medical institutions while preserving data privacy. However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity. We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks. To support reproducibility and fair comparison of future multimodal federated learning (MMFL) methods under realistic medical settings, we release the complete benchmark implementation, including data processing and partitioning pipelines, at https://github.com/bhattarailab/Med-MMFL-Benchmark .

Authors: Jie Chen, Zhu Wang, Chuanbin Liu, Xi Peng

Features of the same sample generated by different pretrained models often exhibit inherently distinct feature distributions because of discrepancies in the model pretraining objectives or architectures. Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

Authors: Gonçalo P. Matos, Carlos Santiago, João P. Costeira, Ricardo L. Saldanha, Ernesto M. Morgado

Following crop growth through the vegetative cycle allows farmers to predict fruit setting and yield in early stages, but it is a laborious and non-scalable task if performed by a human who has to manually measure fruit sizes with a caliper or dendrometers. In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.

Authors: Soumya Jahagirdar, Walid Bousselham, Anna Kukleva, Hilde Kuehne

Current autoregressive Vision Language Models (VLMs) usually rely on a large number of visual tokens to represent images, resulting in a need for more compute especially at inference time. To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.

Authors: Ronghuan Wu, Wanchao Su, Kede Ma, Jing Liao, Rafał K. Mantiuk

High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.

Authors: Cem Eteke, Enzo Tartaglione

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) revolutionized novel view rendering. Instead of inferring from dense spatial points, as implicit representations do, 3DGS uses sparse Gaussians. This enables real-time performance but increases space requirements, hindering applications such as immersive communication. 3DGS compression emerged as a field aimed at alleviating this issue. While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates, down to 0.1 MB, and towards 1000x rate improvement over 3DGS at comparable perceptual performance. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

### 1. [LinGO: A Linguistic Graph Optimization Framework with LLMs for Interpreting Intents of Online Uncivil Discourse](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04693v1)

Authors: Yuan Zhang, Thales Bertaglia

Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.

Authors: Eleni Oikonomaki, Belivanis Dimitris, Kakderi Christina

The geography of innovation offers a framework to understand how territorial characteristics shape innovation, often via spatial and cognitive proximity. Empirical research has focused largely on national and regional scales, while urban and sub-regional geographies receive less attention. Local studies typically rely on limited indicators (e.g., firm-level data, patents, basic socioeconomic measures), with few offering a systematic framework integrating urban form, mobility, amenities, and human-capital proxies at the neighborhood scale. Our study investigates innovation at a finer spatial resolution, going beyond proprietary or static indicators. We develop the Local Innovation Determinants (LID) database and framework to identify key enabling factors across regions, combining traditional government data with publicly available data via APIs for a more granular understanding of spatial dynamics shaping innovation capacity. Using exploratory big and geospatial data analytics and random forest models, we examine neighborhoods in New York and Massachusetts across four dimensions: social factors, economic characteristics, land use and mobility, morphology, and environment. Results show that alternative data sources offer significant yet underexplored potential to enhance insights into innovation dynamics. City policymakers should consider neighborhood-specific determinants and characteristics when designing and implementing local innovation strategies.

### 3. [Fine-grained Classification of A Million Life Trajectories from Wikipedia](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04503v1)

Authors: Zhaoyang Liu, Xiaocong Du, Yixi Zhou, Ye Shi, Haipeng Zhang

Life trajectories of notable people convey essential messages for human dynamics research. These trajectories consist of (\textit{person, time, location, activity type}) tuples recording when and where a person was born, went to school, started a job, or fought in a war. However, current studies only cover limited activity types such as births and deaths, lacking large-scale fine-grained trajectories. Using a tool that extracts (\textit{person, time, location}) triples from Wikipedia, we formulate the problem of classifying these triples into 24 carefully-defined types using textual context as complementary information. The challenge is that triple entities are often scattered in noisy contexts. We use syntactic graphs to bring triple entities and relevant information closer, fusing them with text embeddings to classify life trajectory activities. Since Wikipedia text quality varies, we use LLMs to refine the text for more standardized syntactic graphs. Our framework achieves 84.5\% accuracy, surpassing baselines. We construct the largest fine-grained life trajectory dataset with 3.8 million labeled activities for 589,193 individuals spanning 3 centuries. In the end, we showcase how these trajectories can support grand narratives of human dynamics across time and space. Code/data are publicly available.

### 4. [Performative Learning Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04402v1)

Authors: Julian Rodemann, Unai Fischer-Abaigar, James Bailie, Krikamol Muandet

Performative predictions influence the very outcomes they aim to forecast. We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples. We illustrate our bounds in a case study on prediction-informed assignments of unemployed German residents to job trainings, drawing upon administrative labor market records from 1975 to 2017 in Germany.

### 5. [Convivial Fabrication: Towards Relational Computational Tools For and From Craft Practices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04393v1)

Authors: Ritik Batra, Roy Zunder, Amy Cheatle, Amritansh Kwatra, Ilan Mandel, Thijs Roumen, Steven J. Jackson

Computational tools for fabrication often treat materials as passive rather than active participants in design, abstracting away relationships between craftspeople and materials. For craft communities that value relational practices, abstractions limit the adoption and creative uptake of computational tools which might otherwise be beneficial. To understand how better tool design could support richer relations between individuals, tools, and materials, we interviewed expert woodworkers, fiber artists, and metalworkers. We identify three orders of convivial relations central to craft: immediate relations between individuals, tools, and materials; mid-range relations between communities, platforms, and shared materials; and extended relations between institutions, infrastructures, and ecologies. Our analysis shows how craftspeople engage and struggle with convivial relations across all three orders, creating workflows that learn from materials while supporting autonomy. We conclude with design principles for computational tools and infrastructures to better support material dialogue, collective knowledge, and accountability, along with richer and more convivial relations between craftspeople, tools, and the material worlds around them.

### 6. [They Call Her 'Miss' and Him 'Professor': Lived Experiences of Women Teaching Support Staff in IT/SE Education](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04332v1)

Authors: Vasudha Malhotra, Rhea D'silva, Rashina Hoda

Despite their critical role in shaping student learning in computing education, the contributions of women teaching-support staff (TSS) often go unrecognised and undervalued. In this experience report, we synthesise lived experiences of 15 women TSS in IT/SE higher education to illuminate how authority is earned, resisted, and maintained in everyday teaching. Participants shared both their positive and negative lived experiences associated with finding and losing voice with teaching team colleagues on the one hand, and rewarding connections and gendered friction with students on the other. We map these dynamics onto an intersectional "wheel of privilege and power" tailored to TSS roles. The farther a TSS profile sits from the wheel's center (e.g., non-native English, non-white, younger-seeming, non-permanent, early-career), the more relational, emotional, and disciplinary labour is needed to reach parity. We provide actionable insights and recommendations for creating more inclusive education environments in technology dominant fields that are particularly timely as universities worldwide grapple with post-pandemic teaching models and seek to build more inclusive and resilient academic communities.

### 7. [Inference-Time Reasoning Selectively Reduces Implicit Social Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04742v1)

Authors: Molly Apsel, Michael N. Jones

Drawing on constructs from psychology, prior work has identified a distinction between explicit and implicit bias in large language models (LLMs). While many LLMs undergo post-training alignment and safety procedures to avoid expressions of explicit social bias, they still exhibit significant implicit biases on indirect tasks resembling the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Recent work has further shown that inference-time reasoning can impair LLM performance on tasks that rely on implicit statistical learning. Motivated by a theoretical link between implicit associations and statistical learning in human cognition, we examine how reasoning-enabled inference affects implicit bias in LLMs. We find that enabling reasoning significantly reduces measured implicit bias on an IAT-style evaluation for some model classes across fifteen stereotype topics. This effect appears specific to social bias domains, as we observe no corresponding reduction for non-social implicit associations. As reasoning is increasingly enabled by default in deployed LLMs, these findings suggest that it can meaningfully alter fairness evaluation outcomes in some systems, while also raising questions about how alignment procedures interact with inference-time reasoning to drive variation in bias reduction across model types. More broadly, this work highlights how theory from cognitive science and psychology can complement AI evaluation research by providing methodological and interpretive frameworks that reveal new insights into model behavior.

### 8. [From Data to Behavior: Predicting Unintended Model Behaviors Before Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04735v1)

Authors: Mengru Wang, Zhenqian Xu, Junfeng Fang, Yunzhi Yao, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang

Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.

Authors: Fabiano Veglianti, Lorenzo Antonelli, Gabriele Tolomei

Hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) effectively model higher-order interactions in many real-world systems but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their deployment in high-stakes settings.
  We introduce CF-HyperGNNExplainer, a counterfactual explanation method for HGNNs that identifies the minimal structural changes required to alter a model's prediction. The method generates counterfactual hypergraphs using actionable edits limited to removing node-hyperedge incidences or deleting hyperedges, producing concise and structurally meaningful explanations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that CF-HyperGNNExplainer generates valid and concise counterfactuals, highlighting the higher-order relations most critical to HGNN decisions.

Authors: Michelle L. Ding, Harini Suresh, Suresh Venkatasubramanian

The last decade has witnessed a rapid advancement of generative AI technology that significantly scaled the accessibility of AI-generated non-consensual intimate images (AIG-NCII), a form of image-based sexual abuse that disproportionately harms women and girls. There is a patchwork of commendable efforts across industry, policy, academia, and civil society to address AIG-NCII. However, these efforts lack a shared, consistent mental model that situates the technologies they target within the context of a large, interconnected, and ever-evolving technological ecosystem. As a result, interventions remain siloed and are difficult to evaluate and compare, leading to a reactive cycle of whack-a-mole. We contribute the first comprehensive AIG-NCII technological ecosystem that maps and taxonomizes 11 categories of technologies facilitating the creation, distribution, proliferation and discovery, infrastructural support, and monetization of AIG-NCII. First, we build and visualize the ecosystem through a synthesis of over a hundred primary sources from researchers, journalists, advocates, policymakers, and technologists. Next, we demonstrate how stakeholders can use the ecosystem as a tool to 1) understand new incidents of harm via a case study of Grok and 2) evaluate existing interventions via three more case studies. We conclude with three actionable recommendations, namely that stakeholders should 1) use the ecosystem to map out state, federal, and international laws to produce a clearer policy landscape, 2) collectively develop a database that dynamically tracks the 11 technologies in the ecosystem to better evaluate interventions, and 3) adopt a relational approach to researching AIG-NCII to better understand how the ecosystem technologies interact.

### Databases

### 1. [Identifying knowledge gaps in biodiversity data and their determinants at the regional level](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04314v1)

Authors: Didier Alard, Anaïs Guéry

Biodiversity open-access databases are valuable resources in the structuring and accessibility of species occurrence data. By compiling different data sources, they reveal the uneven spatial distribution of knowledge, with areas or taxonomic groups better prospected than others. Understanding the determinants of spatial and taxonomic knowledge gaps helps in informing the use of open-access data. Here, we identified knowledge gaps' determinants within a French regional biodiversity database, in the largest administrative region in France. Knowledge gaps were assessed using two metrics, completeness and ignorance scores, for 8 taxonomic groups covering five vertebrates and three invertebrates groups. The data was analyzed for the entire region, but also at the level of the three former sub-regions, to identify the potential drivers that may account for knowledge gaps' determinants. Our findings show that invertebrates were characterized by higher knowledge gaps than vertebrates. Overall, knowledge gaps are influenced by variables related to sites' accessibility rather than ecological appeal across both metrics. All groups shared similar determinants of gaps, except for the impact of agricultural pressure which is found to be more significant for invertebrates than vertebrates. Ultimately, our study emphasizes the impact of biodiversity governance, through local funding and regional political decisions, on knowledge distribution in open-access databases. We recommend limiting these biases by redirecting biodiversity funding towards under-sampled taxonomic groups and under-prospected areas. When not possible, users of data extracted from these databases should correct for spatial-sampling biases (SSP) using knowledge gaps' maps in order to get a more accurate understanding of species occurrence.

### 2. [The Stretto Execution Engine for LLM-Augmented Data Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04430v1)

Authors: Gabriele Sanmartino, Matthias Urban, Paolo Papotti, Carsten Binnig

LLM-augmented data systems enable semantic querying over structured and unstructured data, but executing queries with LLM-powered operators introduces a fundamental runtime--accuracy trade-off. In this paper, we present Stretto, a new execution engine that provides end-to-end query guarantees while efficiently navigating this trade-off in a holistic manner. For this, Stretto formulates query planning as a constrained optimization problem and uses a gradient-based optimizer to jointly select operator implementations and allocate error budgets across pipelines. Moreover, to enable fine-grained execution choices, Stretto introduces a novel idea on how KV-caching can be used to realize a spectrum of different physical operators that transform a sparse design space into a dense continuum of runtime--accuracy trade-offs. Experiments show that Stretto outperforms state-of-the-art systems while consistently meeting quality guarantees.

### 3. [LatentTune: Efficient Tuning of High Dimensional Database Parameters via Latent Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04190v1)

Authors: Sein Kwon, Youngwan Jo, Seungyeon Choi, Jieun Lee, Huijun Jin, Sanghyun Park

As data volumes continue to grow, optimizing database performance has become increasingly critical, making the implementation of effective tuning methods essential. Among various approaches, database parameter tuning has proven to be a highly effective means of enhancing performance. Recent studies have shown that machine learning techniques can successfully optimize database parameters, leading to significant performance improvements. However, existing methods still face several limitations. First, they require substantial time to generate large training datasets. Second, to cope with the challenges of highdimensional optimization, they typically optimize only a subset of parameters rather than the full configuration space. Third, they often rely on information from similar workloads instead of directly leveraging information from the target workload. To address these limitations, we propose LatentTune, a novel approach that differs fundamentally from traditional methods. To reduce the time required for data generation, LatentTune incorporates a data augmentation strategy. Furthermore, it constructs a latent space that compresses information from all database parameters, enabling the optimization of the full configuration space. In addition, LatentTune integrates external metric information into the latent space, allowing for precise tuning tailored to the actual target workload. Experimental results demonstrate that LatentTune outperforms baseline models across four workloads on MySQL and RocksDB, achieving up to 1332% improvement for RocksDB and 11.82% throughput gain with 46.01% latency reduction for MySQL.

### 4. [Piece of CAKE: Adaptive Execution Engines via Microsecond-Scale Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04181v1)

Authors: Zijie Zhao, Ryan Marcus

Low-level database operators often admit multiple physical implementations ("kernels") that are semantically equivalent but have vastly different performance characteristics depending on the input data distribution. Existing database systems typically rely on static heuristics or worst-case optimal defaults to select these kernels, often missing significant performance opportunities. In this work, we propose CAKE (Counterfactual Adaptive Kernel Execution), a system that learns to select the optimal kernel for each data "morsel" using a microsecond-scale contextual multi-armed bandit. CAKE circumvents the high latency of traditional reinforcement learning by exploiting the cheapness of counterfactuals -- selectively running multiple kernels to obtain full feedback -- and compiling policies into low-latency regret trees. Experimentally, we show that CAKE can reduce end-to-end workload latency by up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art static heuristics.

### 5. [Data Agents: Levels, State of the Art, and Open Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04261v1)

Authors: Yuyu Luo, Guoliang Li, Ju Fan, Nan Tang

Data agents are an emerging paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) and tool-using agents to automate data management, preparation, and analysis tasks. However, the term "data agent" is currently used inconsistently, conflating simple query responsive assistants with aspirational fully autonomous "data scientists". This ambiguity blurs capability boundaries and accountability, making it difficult for users, system builders, and regulators to reason about what a "data agent" can and cannot do.
  In this tutorial, we propose the first hierarchical taxonomy of data agents from Level 0 (L0, no autonomy) to Level 5 (L5, full autonomy). Building on this taxonomy, we will introduce a lifecycleand level-driven view of data agents. We will (1) present the L0-L5 taxonomy and the key evolutionary leaps that separate simple assistants from truly autonomous data agents, (2) review representative L0-L2 systems across data management, preparation, and analysis, (3) highlight emerging Proto-L3 systems that strive to autonomously orchestrate end-to-end data workflows to tackle diverse and comprehensive data-related tasks under supervision, and (4) discuss forward-looking research challenges towards proactive (L4) and generative (L5) data agents. We aim to offer both a practical map of today's systems and a research roadmap for the next decade of data-agent development.

### 1. [Entanglement improves coordination in distributed systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04588v1)

Authors: Francisco Ferreira da Silva, Stephanie Wehner

Coordination in distributed systems is often hampered by communication latency, which degrades performance. Quantum entanglement offers fundamentally stronger correlations than classically achievable without communication. Crucially, these correlations manifest instantaneously upon measurement, irrespective of the physical distance separating the systems. We investigate the application of shared entanglement to a dual-work optimization problem in a distributed system comprising two servers. The system must process both a continuously available, preemptible baseline task and incoming customer requests arriving in pairs. System performance is characterized by the trade-off between baseline task throughput and customer waiting time. We present a rigorous analytical model demonstrating that when the baseline task throughput function is strictly convex, rewarding longer uninterrupted processing periods, entanglement-assisted routing strategies achieve Pareto-superior performance compared to optimal communication-free classical strategies. We prove this advantage through queueing-theoretic analysis, non-local game formulation, and computational certification of classical bounds. Our results identify distributed scheduling and coordination as a novel application domain for near-term entanglement-based quantum networks.

### 2. [SPEAR: An Engineering Case Study of Multi-Agent Coordination for Smart Contract Auditing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04418v1)

Authors: Arnab Mallick, Indraveni Chebolu, Harmesh Rana

We present SPEAR, a multi-agent coordination framework for smart contract auditing that applies established MAS patterns in a realistic security analysis workflow. SPEAR models auditing as a coordinated mission carried out by specialized agents: a Planning Agent prioritizes contracts using risk-aware heuristics, an Execution Agent allocates tasks via the Contract Net protocol, and a Repair Agent autonomously recovers from brittle generated artifacts using a programmatic-first repair policy. Agents maintain local beliefs updated through AGM-compliant revision, coordinate via negotiation and auction protocols, and revise plans as new information becomes available. An empirical study compares the multi-agent design with centralized and pipeline-based alternatives under controlled failure scenarios, focusing on coordination, recovery behavior, and resource use.

### 3. [A TEE-based Approach for Preserving Data Secrecy in Process Mining with Decentralized Sources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04697v1)

Authors: Davide Basile, Valerio Goretti, Luca Barbaro, Hajo A. Reijers, Claudio Di Ciccio

Process mining techniques enable organizations to gain insights into their business processes through the analysis of execution records (event logs) stored by information systems. While most process mining efforts focus on intra-organizational scenarios, many real-world business processes span multiple independent organizations. Inter-organizational process mining, though, faces significant challenges, particularly regarding confidentiality guarantees: The analysis of data can reveal information that the participating organizations may not consent to disclose to one another, or to a third party hosting process mining services. To overcome this issue, this paper presents CONFINE, an approach for secrecy-preserving inter-organizational process mining. CONFINE leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deploy trusted applications that are capable of securely mining multi-party event logs while preserving data secrecy. We propose an architecture supporting a four-stage protocol to secure data exchange and processing, allowing for protected transfer and aggregation of unaltered process data across organizational boundaries. To avoid out-of-memory errors due to the limited capacity of TEEs, our protocol employs a segmentation-based strategy, whereby event logs are transmitted to TEEs in smaller batches. We conduct a formal verification of correctness and a security analysis of the guarantees provided by the TEE core. We evaluate our implementation on real-world and synthetic data, showing that the proposed approach can handle realistic workloads. The results indicate logarithmic memory growth with respect to the event log size and linear growth with the number of provisioning organizations, highlighting scalability properties and opportunities for further optimization.

### 4. [Scalable Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS) for Edge AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04120v1)

Authors: Samaresh Kumar Singh, Joyjit Roy

Though Explainable AI (XAI) has made significant advancements, its inclusion in edge and IoT systems is typically ad-hoc and inefficient. Most current methods are "coupled" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments. Overall, this work enables the deployment of transparent and accountable AI across large scale, heterogeneous IoT systems, and bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality.

### 5. [Horizon-LM: A RAM-Centric Architecture for LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04816v1)

Authors: Zhengqing Yuan, Lichao Sun, Yanfang, Ye

The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.

### 6. [Six Times to Spare: LDPC Acceleration on DGX Spark for AI-Native Open RAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04652v1)

Authors: Ryan Barker, Fatemeh Afghah

Low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding is one of the most computationally intensive kernels in the 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer and must complete within a 0.5\,ms transmission time interval while sharing the budget with FFT, channel estimation, demapping, HARQ, and MAC scheduling. Many open and proprietary stacks still execute LDPC on general-purpose CPUs, raising concerns about missed-slot events and limited scalability as bandwidths, modulation orders, and user multiplexing increase. This paper empirically quantifies the benefit of offloading 5G-style LDPC5G decoding from a Grace CPU to the integrated Blackwell GB10 GPU on an NVIDIA DGX~Spark platform. Using NVIDIA Sionna PHY/SYS on TensorFlow, we construct an NR-like link-level chain with an LDPC5G encoder/decoder, 16-QAM modulation, and AWGN, and sweep both the number of codewords decoded in parallel and the number of belief-propagation iterations, timing only the decoding phase while logging CPU and GPU utilization and power. Across the sweep we observe an average GPU/CPU throughput speedup of approximately $6\times$, with per-codeword CPU latency reaching $\approx 0.71$\,ms at 20 iterations (exceeding the 0.5\,ms slot), while the GB10 GPU remains within 6--24\% of the slot for the same workloads. Resource-usage measurements show that CPU-based LDPC decoding often consumes around ten Grace cores, whereas GPU-based decoding adds only $\approx10-15$\,W over GPU idle while leaving most CPU capacity available for higher-layer tasks. Because our implementation relies on high-level Sionna layers rather than hand-tuned CUDA, these results represent conservative lower bounds on achievable accelerator performance and provide a reusable, scriptable methodology for evaluating LDPC and other physical-layer kernels on future Grace/Blackwell and Aerial/ACAR/AODT platforms.

### 7. [Trust The Typical](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04581v1)

Authors: Debargha Ganguly, Sreehari Sankar, Biyao Zhang, Vikash Singh, Kanan Gupta, Harshini Kavuru, Alan Luo, Weicong Chen, Warren Morningstar, Raghu Machiraju, Vipin Chaudhary

Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.

Authors: Myroslava Hladchenko

This study explores how EU integration, globalisation, and geopolitical disruptions have influenced scientific collaboration among European countries at different stages of EU membership. Specifically, it distinguishes between the EU-14, the EU-13, that joined the EU in 2004 or later, and EU candidate countries. Using Scopus article, the study analyses Relative Intensity of Collaboration (RIC) among EU member state, candidate countries and China, Latin America, the UK, the USA and Russia. Findings indicate increasing integration within European groups and with global partners, yet persistent hierarchical structures remain. EU-14 countries form the core of the network, exhibiting stable and cohesive collaboration, including with the UK despite Brexit. EU-13 countries occupy an intermediate position, showing moderate collaboration with EU-14 but stronger collaboration within their own group, with EU candidate countries and Russia. EU candidate countries demonstrate even weaker integration with EU-14, focusing on intra-group ties and links with EU-13 and Russia. RIC peaks in 2012 and 2018 for EU-13 and EU candidate countries correspond to Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe cycles, highlighting the role of EU Framework Programmes. Collaboration with Russia increased following 2014 and only marginally declined after 2022. For EU-14, it exceeds collaboration with the USA. Collaboration with China remains limited due to network and cultural constraints, with similar intensity across all three groups. Overall, funding and policy initiatives are critical for stable international collaboration.

Authors: Yifan Lin, Shenyu Qin, Kangning Wang, Lirong Xia

We study the committee selection problem in the canonical impartial culture model with a large number of voters and an even larger candidate set. Here, each voter independently reports a uniformly random preference order over the candidates. For a fixed committee size $k$, we ask when a committee can collectively beat every candidate outside the committee by a prescribed majority level $α$. We focus on two natural notions of collective dominance, $α$-winning and $α$-dominating sets, and we identify sharp threshold phenomena for both of them using probabilistic methods, duality arguments, and rounding techniques.
  We first consider $α$-winning sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $α$-winning if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, at least an $α$-fraction of voters rank some member of $S$ above $a$. We show a sharp threshold at \[ α_{\mathrm{win}}^\star = 1 - \frac{1}{k}. \] Specifically, an $α$-winning set of size $k$ exists with high probability when $α< α_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$, and is unlikely to exist when $α> α_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$.
  We then study the stronger notion of $α$-dominating sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $α$-dominating if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, there exists a single committee member $b \in S$ such that at least an $α$-fraction of voters prefer $b$ to $a$. Here we establish an analogous sharp threshold at \[ α_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2k}. \] As a corollary, our analysis yields an impossibility result for $α$-dominating sets: for every $k$ and every $α> α_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = 1 / 2 - 1 / (2k)$, there exist preference profiles that admit no $α$-dominating set of size $k$. This corollary improves the best previously known bounds for all $k \geq 2$.

Authors: Florian Adriaens, Nikolaj tatti

Given a signed graph, the bad triangle transversal (BTT) problem asks to find the smallest number of edges that need to be removed such that the remaining graph does not have a triangle with exactly one negative edge (a bad triangle). We propose novel 2-approximations for this problem, which are much simpler and faster than a folklore adaptation of the 2-approximation by Krivelevich for finding a minimum triangle transversal in unsigned graphs. One of our algorithms also works for weighted BTT and for approximately optimal feasible solutions to the bad triangle cover LP. Using a recent result on approximating the bad triangle cover LP, we obtain a $(2+ε)$ approximation in time almost equal to the time needed to find a maximal set of edge-disjoint bad triangles (which would give a standard 3-approximation). Additionally, several inapproximability results are provided. For complete signed graphs, we show that BTT is NP-hard to approximate with factor better than $\frac{2137}{2136}$. Our reduction also implies the same hardness result for related problems such as correlation clustering (cluster editing), cluster deletion and the min. strong triadic closure problem. On complete signed graphs, BTT is closely related to correlation clustering. We show that the correlation clustering optimum is at most $3/2$ times the BTT optimum, by describing a pivot procedure that transforms BTT solutions into clusters. This improves a result by Veldt, which states that their ratio is at most two.

### 2. [QuadRank: Engineering a High Throughput Rank](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04103v1)

Authors: R. Groot Koerkamp

Given a text, a query $\mathsf{rank}(q, c)$ counts the number of occurrences of character $c$ among the first $q$ characters of the text. Space-efficient methods to answer these rank queries form an important building block in many succinct data structures. For example, the FM-index is a widely used data structure that uses rank queries to locate all occurrences of a pattern in a text.
  In bioinformatics applications, the goal is usually to process a given input as fast as possible. Thus, data structures should have high throughput when used with many threads.
  Contributions. For the binary alphabet, we develop BiRank with 3.28% space overhead. It merges the central ideas of two recent papers: (1) we interleave (inline) offsets in each cache line of the underlying bit vector [Laws et al., 2024], reducing cache-misses, and (2) these offsets are to the middle of each block so that only half of them need popcounting [Gottlieb and Reinert, 2025]. In QuadRank (14.4% space overhead), we extend these techniques to the $σ=4$ (DNA) alphabet.
  Both data structures require only a single cache miss per query, making them highly suitable for high-throughput and memory-bound settings. To enable efficient batch-processing, we support prefetching the cache lines required to answer upcoming queries.
  Results. BiRank and QuadRank are around $1.5\times$ and $2\times$ faster than similar-overhead methods that do not use inlining. Prefetching gives an additional $2\times$ speedup, at which point the dual-channel DDR4 RAM bandwidth becomes a hard limit on the total throughput. With prefetching, both methods outperform all other methods apart from SPIDER [Laws et al., 2024] by $2\times$.
  When using QuadRank with prefetching in a toy count-only FM-index, QuadFm, this results in a smaller size and up to $4\times$ speedup over Genedex, a state-of-the-art batching FM-index implementation.

### 3. [The Needle is a Thread: Finding Planted Paths in Noisy Process Trees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04694v1)

Authors: Maya Le, Paweł Prałat, Aaron Smith, François Théberge

Motivated by applications in cybersecurity such as finding meaningful sequences of malware-related events buried inside large amounts of computer log data, we introduce the "planted path" problem and propose an algorithm to find fuzzy matchings between two trees. This algorithm can be used as a "building block" for more complicated workflows. We demonstrate usefulness of a few of such workflows in mining synthetically generated data as well as real-world ACME cybersecurity datasets.

### 4. [The matrix-vector complexity of $Ax=b$](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04842v1)

Authors: Michał Dereziński, Ethan N. Epperly, Raphael A. Meyer

Matrix-vector algorithms, particularly Krylov subspace methods, are widely viewed as the most effective algorithms for solving large systems of linear equations. This paper establishes lower bounds on the worst-case number of matrix-vector products needed by such an algorithm to approximately solve a general linear system. The first main result is that, for a matrix-vector algorithm which can perform products with both a matrix and its transpose, $Ω(κ\log(1/\varepsilon))$ matrix-vector products are necessary to solve a linear system with condition number $κ$ to accuracy $\varepsilon$, matching an upper bound for conjugate gradient on the normal equations. The second main result is that one-sided algorithms, which lack access to the transpose, must use $n$ matrix-vector products to solve an $n \times n$ linear system, even when the problem is perfectly conditioned. Both main results include explicit constants that match known upper bounds up to a factor of four. These results rigorously demonstrate the limitations of matrix-vector algorithms and confirm the optimality of widely used Krylov subspace algorithms.

### 5. [Improved Sparse Recovery for Approximate Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04386v1)

Authors: Yahel Uffenheimer, Omri Weinstein

We present a simple randomized algorithm for approximate matrix multiplication (AMM) whose error scales with the *output* norm $\|AB\|_F$. Given any $n\times n$ matrices $A,B$ and a runtime parameter $r\leq n$, the algorithm produces in $O(n^2(r+\log n))$ time, a matrix $C$ with total squared error $\mathbb{E}[\|C-AB\|_F^2]\le (1-\frac{r}{n})\|AB\|_F^2$, per-entry variance $\|AB\|_F^2/n^2$ and bias $\mathbb{E}[C]=\frac{r}{n}AB$. Alternatively, the algorithm can compute an *unbiased* estimation with expected total squared error $\frac{n}{r}\|{AB}\|_{F}^2$, recovering the state-of-art AMM error obtained by Pagh's TensorSketch algorithm (Pagh, 2013). Our algorithm is a log-factor faster.
  The key insight in the algorithm is a new variation of pseudo-random rotation of the input matrices (a Fast Hadamard Transform with asymmetric diagonal scaling), which redistributes the Frobenius norm of the *output* $AB$ uniformly across its entries.

### 6. [Incongruity-sensitive access to highly compressed strings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04523v1)

Authors: Ferdinando Cicalese, Zsuzsanna Lipták, Travis Gagie, Gonzalo Navarro, Nicola Prezza, Cristian Urbina

Random access to highly compressed strings -- represented by straight-line programs or Lempel-Ziv parses, for example -- is a well-studied topic. Random access to such strings in strongly sublogarithmic time is impossible in the worst case, but previous authors have shown how to support faster access to specific characters and their neighbourhoods. In this paper we explore whether, since better compression can impede access, we can support faster access to relatively incompressible substrings of highly compressed strings. We first show how, given a run-length compressed straight-line program (RLSLP) of size $g_{rl}$ or a block tree of size $L$, we can build an $O (g_{rl})$-space or an $O (L)$-space data structure, respectively, that supports access to any character in time logarithmic in the length of the longest repeated substring containing that character. That is, the more incongruous a character is with respect to the characters around it in a certain sense, the faster we can support access to it. We then prove a similar but more powerful and sophisticated result for parsings in which phrases' sources do not overlap much larger phrases, with the query time depending also on the number of phrases we must copy from their sources to obtain the queried character.

### 1. [SPEAR: An Engineering Case Study of Multi-Agent Coordination for Smart Contract Auditing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04418v1)

Authors: Arnab Mallick, Indraveni Chebolu, Harmesh Rana

We present SPEAR, a multi-agent coordination framework for smart contract auditing that applies established MAS patterns in a realistic security analysis workflow. SPEAR models auditing as a coordinated mission carried out by specialized agents: a Planning Agent prioritizes contracts using risk-aware heuristics, an Execution Agent allocates tasks via the Contract Net protocol, and a Repair Agent autonomously recovers from brittle generated artifacts using a programmatic-first repair policy. Agents maintain local beliefs updated through AGM-compliant revision, coordinate via negotiation and auction protocols, and revise plans as new information becomes available. An empirical study compares the multi-agent design with centralized and pipeline-based alternatives under controlled failure scenarios, focusing on coordination, recovery behavior, and resource use.

### 2. [Quantum-Based Resilient Routing in Networks: Minimizing Latency Under Dual-Link Failures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04495v1)

Authors: Maher Harb, Nader Foroughi, Matt Stehman, Bob Lutz, Nati Erez, Erik Garcell

Network optimization problems represent large combinatorial search spaces that grow exponentially with network size, making them computationally intensive to solve. This paper addresses the latency-resilient Layer 3 routing optimization problem in telecommunications networks with predefined Layer 1 optical links. We formulate this problem as a graph-based optimization problem with the objective of minimizing latency, creating vertex-disjoint paths from each site to the internet backbone, and maximizing overall resiliency by limiting the impact of dual-link failures. By framing the problem as finding two disjoint shortest paths, coupled together with a resiliency component to the objective function, we establish a single formulation to produce optimal path design. The mathematical formulation was adapted to solve the problem using quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) executed over both quantum simulator and quantum hardware. QAOA was tested on a toy graph topology with 5 vertices and 7 edges and considering two limiting scenarios respectively representing independent (uncorrelated) link failures and highly correlated failure for one pair of edges. Both explored scenarios produced the optimal network design-corresponding to the valid solution with highest frequency of occurrence and minimum energy state, hence, validating the proposed formulation for optimizing Layer 3 routing on quantum systems of the future.

### 3. [$C$-$ΔΘ$: Circuit-Restricted Weight Arithmetic for Selective Refusal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04521v1)

Authors: Aditya Kasliwal, Pratinav Seth, Vinay Kumar Sankarapu

Modern deployments require LLMs to enforce safety policies at scale, yet many controls rely on inference-time interventions that add recurring compute cost and serving complexity. Activation steering is widely used, but it requires runtime hooks and scales cost with the number of generations; conditional variants improve selectivity by gating when steering is applied but still retain an inference-time control path. We ask whether selective refusal can be moved entirely offline: can a mechanistic understanding of category-specific refusal be distilled into a circuit-restricted weight update that deploys as a standard checkpoint? We propose C-Δθ: Circuit Restricted Weight Arithmetic, which (i) localizes refusal-causal computation as a sparse circuit using EAP-IG and (ii) computes a constrained weight update ΔθC supported only on that circuit (typically <5% of parameters). Applying ΔθC yields a drop-in edited checkpoint with no inference-time hooks, shifting cost from per-request intervention to a one-time offline update. We evaluate category-targeted selectivity and capability retention on refusal and utility benchmarks.

### 4. [Restoring Sparsity in Potts Machines via Mean-Field Constraints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04200v1)

Authors: Kevin Callahan-Coray, Kyle Lee, Kyle Jiang, Kerem Y. Camsari

Ising machines and related probabilistic hardware have emerged as promising platforms for NP-hard optimization and sampling. However, many practical problems involve constraints that induce dense or all-to-all couplings, undermining scalability and hardware efficiency. We address this constraint-induced density through two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a hardware-aware native formulation for multi-state probabilistic digits (p-dits) that avoids the locally dense intra-variable couplings required by binary Ising encodings. We validate p-dit dynamics by reproducing known critical behavior of the 2D Potts model. Second, we propose mean-field constraints (MFC), a hybrid scheme that replaces dense pairwise constraint couplings with dynamically updated single-node biases. Applied to balanced graph partitioning, MFC achieves solution quality comparable to exact all-to-all constraint formulations while dramatically reducing graph density. Finally, we demonstrate the practical impact of restored sparsity by an FPGA implementation, enabling orders-of-magnitude acceleration over CPU-based solvers. Together, these results outline a pathway for scaling constrained optimization on probabilistic hardware.

### 5. [Self-evolving Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04411v1)

Authors: Tongtong Feng, Xin Wang, Wenwu Zhu

Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system formed by agents and their environment through active perception, embodied cognition, and action interaction. Existing embodied AI remains confined to human-crafted setting, in which agents are trained on given memory and construct models for given tasks, enabling fixed embodiments to interact with relatively static environments. Such methods fail in in-the-wild setting characterized by variable embodiments and dynamic open environments. This paper introduces self-evolving embodied AI, a new paradigm in which agents operate based on their changing state and environment with memory self-updating, task self-switching, environment self-prediction, embodiment self-adaptation, and model self-evolution, aiming to achieve continually adaptive intelligence with autonomous evolution. Specifically, we present the definition, framework, components, and mechanisms of self-evolving embodied AI, systematically review state-of-the-art works for realized components, discuss practical applications, and point out future research directions. We believe that self-evolving embodied AI enables agents to autonomously learn and interact with environments in a human-like manner and provide a new perspective toward general artificial intelligence.

### 6. [A computational account of dreaming: learning and memory consolidation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04095v1)

Authors: Qi Zhang

A number of studies have concluded that dreaming is mostly caused by randomly arriving internal signals because "dream contents are random impulses", and argued that dream sleep is unlikely to play an important part in our intellectual capacity. On the contrary, numerous functional studies have revealed that dream sleep does play an important role in our learning and other intellectual functions. Specifically, recent studies have suggested the importance of dream sleep in memory consolidation, following the findings of neural replaying of recent waking patterns in the hippocampus. The randomness has been the hurdle that divides dream theories into either functional or functionless. This study presents a cognitive and computational model of dream process. This model is simulated to perform the functions of learning and memory consolidation, which are two most popular dream functions that have been proposed. The simulations demonstrate that random signals may result in learning and memory consolidation. Thus, dreaming is proposed as a continuation of brain's waking activities that processes signals activated spontaneously and randomly from the hippocampus. The characteristics of the model are discussed and found in agreement with many characteristics concluded from various empirical studies.

Authors: Yi Wang, Ben Cheng, Xiao Liu, Chetan Arora, John Grundy, Thuong Hoang

In this paper, we developed a virtual reality (VR) system that can simulate color blindness and weakness. We built an immersive 3D web view interface where participants can discuss accessibility requirements for a fitness website projects within a virtual fitness environment. We conducted a pilot experiment involving 24 participants from six software teams, who used both VR and non-VR methods to understand color blindness and weakness requirements in a website project. Our findings indicate that using VR can provide several benefits for requirements activities, such as an improved user experience and reduced workload.

### 8. [KGLAMP: Knowledge Graph-guided Language model for Adaptive Multi-robot Planning and Replanning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04129v1)

Authors: Chak Lam Shek, Faizan M. Tariq, Sangjae Bae, David Isele, Piyush Gupta

Heterogeneous multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in long-horizon missions that require coordination among robots with diverse capabilities. However, existing planning approaches struggle to construct accurate symbolic representations and maintain plan consistency in dynamic environments. Classical PDDL planners require manually crafted symbolic models, while LLM-based planners often ignore agent heterogeneity and environmental uncertainty. We introduce KGLAMP, a knowledge-graph-guided LLM planning framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. The framework maintains a structured knowledge graph encoding object relations, spatial reachability, and robot capabilities, which guides the LLM in generating accurate PDDL problem specifications. The knowledge graph serves as a persistent, dynamically updated memory that incorporates new observations and triggers replanning upon detecting inconsistencies, enabling symbolic plans to adapt to evolving world states. Experiments on the MAT-THOR benchmark show that KGLAMP improves performance by at least 25.5% over both LLM-only and PDDL-based variants.

### 9. [The Dynamics of Attention across Automated and Manual Driving Modes: A Driving Simulation Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04164v1)

Authors: Yuan Cai, Mustafa Demir, Farzan Sasangohar, Mohsen Zare

This study aims to explore the dynamics of driver attention to various zones, including the road, the central mirror, the embedded Human-Machine Interface (HMI), and the speedometer, across different driving modes in AVs. The integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems has introduced critical safety concerns, particularly regarding driver re-engagement during mode transitions. Past accidents underscore the risks of overreliance on automation and highlight the need to understand dynamic attention allocation to support safety in autonomous driving. A high-fidelity driving simulation was conducted. Eye-tracking technology was used to measure fixation duration, fixation count, and time to first fixation across distinct driving modes (automated, manual, and transition), which were then used to assess how drivers allocated attention to various areas of interest (AOIs). Findings show that drivers' attention varies significantly across driving modes. In manual mode, attention consistently focuses on the road, while in automated mode, prolonged fixation on the embedded HMI was observed. During the handover and takeover phases, attention shifts dynamically between environmental and technological elements. The study reveals that driver attention allocation is mode-dependent. These findings inform the design of adaptive HMIs in AVs that align with drivers' attention patterns. By presenting relevant information according to the driving context, such systems can enhance driver-vehicle interaction, support effective transitions, and improve overall safety. Systematic analysis of visual attention dynamics across driving modes is gaining prominence, as it informs adaptive HMI designs and driver readiness interventions. The GLMM findings can be directly applied to the design of adaptive HMIs or driver training programs to enhance attention and improve safety.

### 1. [Event-T2M: Event-level Conditioning for Complex Text-to-Motion Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04292v1)

Authors: Seong-Eun Hong, JaeYoung Seon, JuYeong Hwang, JongHwan Shin, HyeongYeop Kang

Text-to-motion generation has advanced with diffusion models, yet existing systems often collapse complex multi-action prompts into a single embedding, leading to omissions, reordering, or unnatural transitions. In this work, we shift perspective by introducing a principled definition of an event as the smallest semantically self-contained action or state change in a text prompt that can be temporally aligned with a motion segment. Building on this definition, we propose Event-T2M, a diffusion-based framework that decomposes prompts into events, encodes each with a motion-aware retrieval model, and integrates them through event-based cross-attention in Conformer blocks. Existing benchmarks mix simple and multi-event prompts, making it unclear whether models that succeed on single actions generalize to multi-action cases. To address this, we construct HumanML3D-E, the first benchmark stratified by event count. Experiments on HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and HumanML3D-E show that Event-T2M matches state-of-the-art baselines on standard tests while outperforming them as event complexity increases. Human studies validate the plausibility of our event definition, the reliability of HumanML3D-E, and the superiority of Event-T2M in generating multi-event motions that preserve order and naturalness close to ground-truth. These results establish event-level conditioning as a generalizable principle for advancing text-to-motion generation beyond single-action prompts.

### 2. [X2HDR: HDR Image Generation in a Perceptually Uniform Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04814v1)

Authors: Ronghuan Wu, Wanchao Su, Kede Ma, Jing Liao, Rafał K. Mantiuk

High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.

### 3. [GenMRP: A Generative Multi-Route Planning Framework for Efficient and Personalized Real-Time Industrial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04174v1)

Authors: Chengzhang Wang, Chao Chen, Jun Tao, Tengfei Liu, He Bai, Song Wang, Longfei Xu, Kaikui Liu, Xiangxiang Chu

Existing industrial-scale navigation applications contend with massive road networks, typically employing two main categories of approaches for route planning. The first relies on precomputed road costs for optimal routing and heuristic algorithms for generating alternatives, while the second, generative methods, has recently gained significant attention. However, the former struggles with personalization and route diversity, while the latter fails to meet the efficiency requirements of large-scale real-time scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GenMRP, a generative framework for multi-route planning. To ensure generation efficiency, GenMRP first introduces a skeleton-to-capillary approach that dynamically constructs a relevant sub-network significantly smaller than the full road network. Within this sub-network, routes are generated iteratively. The first iteration identifies the optimal route, while the subsequent ones generate alternatives that balance quality and diversity using the newly proposed correctional boosting approach. Each iteration incorporates road features, user historical sequences, and previously generated routes into a Link Cost Model to update road costs, followed by route generation using the Dijkstra algorithm. Extensive experiments show that GenMRP achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency in both offline and online environments. To facilitate further research, we have publicly released the training and evaluation dataset. GenMRP has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness and benefits.

### 4. [Skin Tokens: A Learned Compact Representation for Unified Autoregressive Rigging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04805v1)

Authors: Jia-peng Zhang, Cheng-Feng Pu, Meng-Hao Guo, Yan-Pei Cao, Shi-Min Hu

The rapid proliferation of generative 3D models has created a critical bottleneck in animation pipelines: rigging. Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation.

### 5. [SkeletonGaussian: Editable 4D Generation through Gaussian Skeletonization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04271v1)

Authors: Lifan Wu, Ruijie Zhu, Yubo Ai, Tianzhu Zhang

4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

Authors: Jin-Chuan Shi, Binhong Ye, Tao Liu, Junzhe He, Yangjinhui Xu, Xiaoyang Liu, Zeju Li, Hao Chen, Chunhua Shen

Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.

Authors: Tiroshan Madushanka, Sakuna Madushanka

While the A* algorithm remains the industry standard for game pathfinding, its integration into dynamic 3D environments faces trade-offs between computational performance and visual realism. This paper proposes a multi-threaded framework that enhances standard A* through Recast-based mesh generation, Bezier-curve trajectory smoothing, and density analysis for crowd coordination. We evaluate our system across ten incremental phases, from 2D mazes to complex multi-level dynamic worlds. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework maintains 350+ FPS with 1000 simultaneous agents and achieves collision-free crowd navigation through density-aware path coordination.

Authors: Amit Ronen, S. S. Ravi, Sarit Kraus

In many matching markets--such as athlete recruitment or academic admissions--participants on one side are evaluated by attribute vectors known to the other side, which in turn applies individual \emph{salience vectors} to assign relative importance to these attributes. Since saliences are known to change in practice, a central question arises: how robust is a stable matching to such perturbations? We address several fundamental questions in this context.
  First, we formalize robustness as a radius within which a stable matching remains immune to blocking pairs under any admissible perturbation of salience vectors (which are assumed to be normalized). Given a stable matching and a radius, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to verify whether the matching is stable within the specified radius. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the maximum robustness radius of a given stable matching. Further, we design an anytime search algorithm that uses certified lower and upper bounds to approximate the most robust stable matching, and we characterize the robustness-cost relationship through efficiently computable bounds that delineate the achievable tradeoff between robustness and cost. Finally, we show that for each stable matching, the set of salience profiles that preserve its stability factors is a product of low-dimensional polytopes within the simplex. This geometric structure precisely characterizes the polyhedral shape of each robustness region; its volume can then be computed efficiently, with approximate methods available as the dimension grows, thereby linking robustness analysis in matching markets with classical tools from convex geometry.

### 2. [Winning in the Limit: Average-Case Committee Selection with Many Candidates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04815v1)

Authors: Yifan Lin, Shenyu Qin, Kangning Wang, Lirong Xia

We study the committee selection problem in the canonical impartial culture model with a large number of voters and an even larger candidate set. Here, each voter independently reports a uniformly random preference order over the candidates. For a fixed committee size $k$, we ask when a committee can collectively beat every candidate outside the committee by a prescribed majority level $α$. We focus on two natural notions of collective dominance, $α$-winning and $α$-dominating sets, and we identify sharp threshold phenomena for both of them using probabilistic methods, duality arguments, and rounding techniques.
  We first consider $α$-winning sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $α$-winning if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, at least an $α$-fraction of voters rank some member of $S$ above $a$. We show a sharp threshold at \[ α_{\mathrm{win}}^\star = 1 - \frac{1}{k}. \] Specifically, an $α$-winning set of size $k$ exists with high probability when $α< α_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$, and is unlikely to exist when $α> α_{\mathrm{win}}^\star$.
  We then study the stronger notion of $α$-dominating sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $α$-dominating if, for every outside candidate $a \notin S$, there exists a single committee member $b \in S$ such that at least an $α$-fraction of voters prefer $b$ to $a$. Here we establish an analogous sharp threshold at \[ α_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2k}. \] As a corollary, our analysis yields an impossibility result for $α$-dominating sets: for every $k$ and every $α> α_{\mathrm{dom}}^\star = 1 / 2 - 1 / (2k)$, there exist preference profiles that admit no $α$-dominating set of size $k$. This corollary improves the best previously known bounds for all $k \geq 2$.

### 3. [Graph-Based Audits for Meek Single Transferable Vote Elections](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04527v1)

Authors: Edouard Heitzmann

In the context of election security, a Risk-Limiting Audit (RLA) is a statistical framework that uses a minimal partial recount of the ballots to guarantee that the results of the election were correctly reported. A generalized RLA framework has remained elusive for algorithmic election rules such as the Single Transferable Vote (STV) rule, because of the dependence of these rules on the chronology of eliminations and elections leading to the outcome of the election. This paper proposes a new graph-based approach to audit these algorithmic election rules, by considering the space of all possible sequences of elections and eliminations. If we fix a subgraph of this universal space ahead of the audit, a sufficient strategy is to verify statistically that the true election sequence does not leave the fixed subgraph. This makes for a flexible framework to audit these elections in a chronology-agnostic way.

We study a setting in which two players play a (possibly approximate) Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game, while a learner observes only their actions and has no knowledge of the equilibrium or the underlying game. A natural question is whether the learner can rationalize the observed behavior by inferring the players' payoff functions. Rather than producing a single payoff estimate, inverse game theory aims to identify the entire set of payoffs consistent with observed behavior, enabling downstream use in, e.g., counterfactual analysis and mechanism design across applications like auctions, pricing, and security games. We focus on the problem of estimating the set of feasible payoffs with high probability and up to precision $ε$ on the Hausdorff metric. We provide the first minimax-optimal rates for both exact and approximate equilibrium play, in zero-sum as well as general-sum games. Our results provide learning-theoretic foundations for set-valued payoff inference in multi-agent environments.

### 5. [Maximin Relative Improvement: Fair Learning as a Bargaining Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04155v1)

Authors: Jiwoo Han, Moulinath Banerjee, Yuekai Sun

When deploying a single predictor across multiple subpopulations, we propose a fundamentally different approach: interpreting group fairness as a bargaining problem among subpopulations. This game-theoretic perspective reveals that existing robust optimization methods such as minimizing worst-group loss or regret correspond to classical bargaining solutions and embody different fairness principles. We propose relative improvement, the ratio of actual risk reduction to potential reduction from a baseline predictor, which recovers the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. Unlike absolute-scale methods that may not be comparable when groups have different potential predictability, relative improvement provides axiomatic justification including scale invariance and individual monotonicity. We establish finite-sample convergence guarantees under mild conditions.

### 6. [From Competition to Collaboration: Designing Sustainable Mechanisms Between LLMs and Online Forums](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04572v1)

Authors: Niv Fono, Yftah Ziser, Omer Ben-Porat

While Generative AI (GenAI) systems draw users away from (Q&A) forums, they also depend on the very data those forums produce to improve their performance. Addressing this paradox, we propose a framework of sequential interaction, in which a GenAI system proposes questions to a forum that can publish some of them. Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario. Our results highlight the potential for sustainable collaboration that preserves effective knowledge sharing between AI systems and human knowledge platforms.

### 7. [Properties of the core and other solution concepts of Bel coalitional games in the ex-ante scenario](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04817v1)

Authors: Michel Grabisch, Silvia Lorenzini

We study the properties of the core and other solution concepts of Bel coalitional games, that generalize classical coalitional games by introducing uncertainty in the framework. In this uncertain environment, we work with contracts, that specify how agents divide the values of the coalitions in the different states of the world. Every agent can have different a priori knowledge on the true state of the world, which is modeled through the Dempster-Shafer theory, while agents' preferences between contracts are modeled by the Choquet integral. We focus on the "ex-ante" scenario, when the contract is evaluated before uncertainty is resolved. We investigate the geometrical structure of the ex-ante core when agents have the same a priori knowledge which is a probability distribution. Finally, we define the (pre)nucleolus, the kernel and the bargaining set (a la Mas-Colell) in the ex-ante situation and we study their properties. It is found that the inclusion relations among these solution concepts are the same as in the classical case. Coincidence of the ex-ante core and the ex-ante bargaining set holds for convex Bel coalitional games, at the price of strengthening the definition of bargaining sets.

### 8. [MaMa: A Game-Theoretic Approach for Designing Safe Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04431v1)

Authors: Jonathan Nöther, Adish Singla, Goran Radanovic

LLM-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but they also introduce significant safety risks when individual agents fail or behave adversarially. In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success. Moreover, the resulting systems generalize to stronger adversaries, as well as ones with different attack objectives or underlying LLMs, demonstrating robust safety beyond the training setting.

### 9. [The impact of heterogeneity on the co-evolution of cooperation and epidemic spreading in complex networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04481v1)

Authors: Mehran Noori, Nahid Azimi-Tafreshi, Mohammad Salahshour

The dynamics of herd immunity depend crucially on the interaction between collective social behavior and disease transmission, but the role of heterogeneity in this context frequently remains unclear. Here, we dissect this co-evolutionary feedback by coupling a public goods game with an epidemic model on complex networks, including multiplex and real-world networks. Our results reveals a dichotomy in how heterogeneity shapes outcomes. We demonstrate that structural heterogeneity in social networks acts as a powerful catalyst for cooperation and disease suppression. This emergent effect is driven by highly connected hubs who, facing amplified personal risk, adopt protective strategies out of self-interest. In contrast, heterogeneity in individual infection costs proves detrimental, undermining cooperation and amplifying the epidemic. This creates a ``weakest link'' problem, where individuals with low perceived risk act as persistent free-riders and disease reservoirs, degrading the collective response. Our findings establish that heterogeneity is a double-edged sword: its impact is determined by whether it creates an asymmetry of influence (leverage points) or an asymmetry of motivation (weakest links), recommending disease intervention policies that facilitate cooperative transition in hubs (strengthening the leverage point) and homogenize incentives to weakest links.

### 10. [The Complexity of Min-Max Optimization with Product Constraints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04665v1)

Authors: Martino Bernasconi, Matteo Castiglioni

We study the computational complexity of the problem of computing local min-max equilibria of games with a nonconvex-nonconcave utility function $f$. From the work of Daskalakis, Skoulakis, and Zampetakis [DSZ21], this problem was known to be hard in the restrictive case in which players are required to play strategies that are jointly constrained, leaving open the question of its complexity under more natural constraints. In this paper, we settle the question and show that the problem is PPAD-hard even under product constraints and, in particular, over the hypercube.

### Human-Computer Interaction

### 1. [AI in Education Beyond Learning Outcomes: Cognition, Agency, Emotion, and Ethics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04598v1)

Authors: Lucile Favero, Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz, Tanja Käser, Nuria Oliver

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into educational contexts, promising personalized support and increased efficiency. However, growing evidence suggests that the uncritical adoption of AI may produce unintended harms that extend beyond individual learning outcomes to affect broader societal goals. This paper examines the societal implications of AI in education through an integrative framework with four interrelated dimensions: cognition, agency, emotional well-being, and ethics. Drawing on research from education, cognitive science, psychology, and ethics, we synthesize existing evidence to show how AI-driven cognitive offloading, diminished learner agency, emotional disengagement, and surveillance-oriented practices can mutually reinforce one another. We argue that these dynamics risk undermining critical thinking, intellectual autonomy, emotional resilience, and trust, capacities that are foundational both for effective learning and also for democratic participation and informed civic engagement. Moreover, AI's impact is contingent on design and governance: pedagogically aligned, ethically grounded, and human-centered AI systems can scaffold effortful reasoning, support learner agency, and preserve meaningful social interaction. By integrating fragmented strands of prior research into a unified framework, this paper advances the discourse on responsible AI in education and offers actionable implications for educators, designers, and institutions. Ultimately, the paper contends that the central challenge is not whether AI should be used in education, but how it can be designed and governed to support learning while safeguarding the social and civic purposes of education.

### 2. [Proactive Agents, Long-term User Context, VLM Annotation, Privacy Protection, Human-Computer Interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04482v1)

Authors: Yuanbo Tang, Huaze Tang, Tingyu Cao, Lam Nguyen, Anping Zhang, Xinwen Cao, Chunkang Liu, Wenbo Ding, Yang Li

Proactive agents that anticipate user intentions without explicit prompts represent a significant evolution in human-AI interaction, promising to reduce cognitive load and streamline workflows. However, existing datasets suffer from two critical deficiencies: (1) reliance on LLM-synthesized data that fails to capture authentic human decision-making patterns, and (2) focus on isolated tasks rather than continuous workflows, missing the pre-assistance behavioral context essential for learning proactive intervention signals. To address these gaps, we introduce ProAgentBench, a rigorous benchmark for proactive agents in working scenarios. Our contributions include: (1) a hierarchical task framework that decomposes proactive assistance into timing prediction and assist content generation; (2) a privacy-compliant dataset with 28,000+ events from 500+ hours of real user sessions, preserving bursty interaction patterns (burstiness B=0.787) absent in synthetic data; and (3) extensive experiments that evaluates LLM- and VLM-based baselines. Numerically, we showed that long-term memory and historical context significantly enhance prediction accuracy, while real-world training data substantially outperforms synthetic alternatives. We release our dataset and code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ProAgentBench-6BC0.

### 3. [Can Theory-Informed Message Framing Drive Honest and Motivated Performance with Better Assessment Experiences in a Remote Assessment?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04450v1)

Authors: Suvadeep Mukherjee, Björn Rohles, Gabriele Lenzini, Pedro Cardoso-Leite

Remote unproctored assessments increasingly use messaging interventions to reduce cheating, but existing approaches lack theoretical grounding, focus narrowly on cheating suppression while overlooking performance and experience, and treat cheating as binary rather than continuous. This study examines whether messages based on 15 psychological concepts from self-determination, cognitive dissonance, social norms, and self-efficacy theories can reduce cheating while preserving performance and experience. Through an expert workshop (N=5), we developed 45 theory-informed messages and tested them with online participants (N=1232) who completed an incentivized anagram task. Participants were classified as non-cheaters (0% items cheated), partial-cheaters (1-99% cheated), or full-cheaters (100% cheated). Results show that concept-based messages reduced full-cheating occurrence by 42% (33% to 19%), increased non-cheating by 19% (53% to 63%), with no negative effects on performance or experience across integrity groups. Surprisingly, messages grounded in different theoretical concepts produced virtually identical effects. Analyses of self-rated psychological mechanisms revealed that messages influenced multiple mechanisms simultaneously rather than their intended targets, though these mechanisms predicted behavior, performance, and experience. These findings show that causal pathways are more complex than current theories predict. Practically, integrity interventions using supportive motivation rather than rule enforcement can reduce cheating without impairing performance or experience.

### 4. [Normalizing Speed-accuracy Biases in 2D Pointing Tasks with Better Calculation of Effective Target Widths](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04432v1)

Authors: Shota Yamanaka, I. Scott MacKenzie

For evaluations of 2D target selection using Fitts' law, ISO 9241-411 recommends using the effective target width (W_e) calculated using the univariate standard deviation of selection coordinates. Related research proposed using a bivariate standard deviation; however, the proposal was only tested using a single speed-accuracy bias condition, thus the assessment was limited. We compared the univariate and bivariate techniques in a 2D Fitts' law experiment using three speed-accuracy biases and 346 crowdworkers. Calculating W_e using the univariate standard deviation yielded higher model correlations across all bias conditions and produced more stable throughput among the biases. The findings were also consistent in cases using randomly sampled subsets of the participant data. We recommend that future research should calculate W_e using the univariate standard deviation for fair performance evaluations. Also, we found trivial effects when using nominal or effective amplitude and using different perspectives of the task axis.

### 5. [Convivial Fabrication: Towards Relational Computational Tools For and From Craft Practices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04393v1)

Authors: Ritik Batra, Roy Zunder, Amy Cheatle, Amritansh Kwatra, Ilan Mandel, Thijs Roumen, Steven J. Jackson

Computational tools for fabrication often treat materials as passive rather than active participants in design, abstracting away relationships between craftspeople and materials. For craft communities that value relational practices, abstractions limit the adoption and creative uptake of computational tools which might otherwise be beneficial. To understand how better tool design could support richer relations between individuals, tools, and materials, we interviewed expert woodworkers, fiber artists, and metalworkers. We identify three orders of convivial relations central to craft: immediate relations between individuals, tools, and materials; mid-range relations between communities, platforms, and shared materials; and extended relations between institutions, infrastructures, and ecologies. Our analysis shows how craftspeople engage and struggle with convivial relations across all three orders, creating workflows that learn from materials while supporting autonomy. We conclude with design principles for computational tools and infrastructures to better support material dialogue, collective knowledge, and accountability, along with richer and more convivial relations between craftspeople, tools, and the material worlds around them.

### 6. [A Multimodal fNIRS-EEG Dataset for Unilateral Limb Motor Imagery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04299v1)

Authors: Lufeng Feng, Baomin Xu, Haoran Zhang, Bihai Lin, Zuxuan Deng, Sidi Tao, Chenyu Liu, Shifan Jia, Li Duan, Ziyu Jia

Unilateral limb motor imagery (MI) plays an important role in upper-limb motor rehabilitation and precise control of external devices, and places higher demands on spatial resolution. However, most existing public datasets focus on binary- or four-class left-right limb paradigms that mainly exploit coarse hemispheric lateralization, and there is still a lack of multimodal datasets that simultaneously record EEG and fNIRS for unilateral multi-directional MI. To address this gap, we constructed MIND, a public motor imagery fNIRS-EEG dataset based on a four-class directional MI paradigm of the right upper limb. The dataset includes 64-channel EEG recordings (1000 Hz) and 51-channel fNIRS recordings (47.62 Hz) from 30 participants (12 females, 18 males; aged 19.0-25.0 years). We analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of EEG spectral power and hemodynamic responses, and validate the potential advantages of hybrid fNIRS-EEG BCIs in terms of classification accuracy. We expect that this dataset will facilitate the evaluation and comparison of neuroimaging analysis and decoding methods.

Authors: Jiaye Li, Tongshun Chen, Siyi Ma, Elizabeth Churchill, Ke Wu

We introduce PuppetAI, a modular soft robot interaction platform. This platform offers a scalable cable-driven actuation system and a customizable, puppet-inspired robot gesture framework, supporting a multitude of interaction gesture robot design formats. The platform comprises a four-layer decoupled software architecture that includes perceptual processing, affective modeling, motion scheduling, and low-level actuation. We also implemented an affective expression loop that connects human input to the robot platform by producing real-time emotional gestural responses to human vocal input. For our own designs, we have worked with nuanced gestures enacted by "soft robots" with enhanced dexterity and "pleasant-to-touch" plush exteriors. By reducing operational complexity and production costs while enhancing customizability, our work creates an adaptable and accessible foundation for future tactile-based expressive robot research. Our goal is to provide a platform that allows researchers to independently construct or refine highly specific gestures and movements performed by social robots.

### 8. [PersoPilot: An Adaptive AI-Copilot for Transparent Contextualized Persona Classification and Personalized Response Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04540v1)

Authors: Saleh Afzoon, Amin Beheshti, Usman Naseem

Understanding and classifying user personas is critical for delivering effective personalization. While persona information offers valuable insights, its full potential is realized only when contextualized, linking user characteristics with situational context to enable more precise and meaningful service provision. Existing systems often treat persona and context as separate inputs, limiting their ability to generate nuanced, adaptive interactions. To address this gap, we present PersoPilot, an agentic AI-Copilot that integrates persona understanding with contextual analysis to support both end users and analysts. End users interact through a transparent, explainable chat interface, where they can express preferences in natural language, request recommendations, and receive information tailored to their immediate task. On the analyst side, PersoPilot delivers a transparent, reasoning-powered labeling assistant, integrated with an active learning-driven classification process that adapts over time with new labeled data. This feedback loop enables targeted service recommendations and adaptive personalization, bridging the gap between raw persona data and actionable, context-aware insights. As an adaptable framework, PersoPilot is applicable to a broad range of service personalization scenarios.

### 9. [Strategic Adaptation Under Contextual Change: Insights from a Dyadic Negotiation Testbed for AI Coaching Technologies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04242v1)

Authors: Mobasshira Akter Urmi, Raiyan Abdul Baten

Strategic adaptation -- the ability to adjust interaction behavior in response to changing constraints and leverage -- is a central goal of negotiation training and an emerging target for AI coaching systems. However, adaptation is difficult to evaluate because adaptation-relevant moments arise unpredictably in typical tasks. We study a reusable dyadic negotiation testbed that employs a controlled midstream change in one party's outside alternative as a repeatable perturbation to stress-test adaptation. In a six-round chat-based negotiation study (N=100), the perturbation reliably reorganized interaction dynamics: transitions between integrative (cooperative) and distributive (positional) behaviors declined, behavioral diversity narrowed, and interactions drifted toward more distributive tactics. Critically, this distributive drift predicted worse relational experience net of objective outcomes, and adaptation patterns were path dependent on prior behavior. These results establish a methodological bridge for evaluating and comparing AI coaching systems on strategic adaptation as a process and identify failure modes and design targets for adaptive interaction support.

### 10. [Alignment Drift in Multimodal LLMs: A Two-Phase, Longitudinal Evaluation of Harm Across Eight Model Releases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04739v1)

Authors: Casey Ford, Madison Van Doren, Emily Dix

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet their safety under adversarial prompting remains underexplored. We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.

### Information Retrieval

### 1. [AIANO: Enhancing Information Retrieval with AI-Augmented Annotation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04579v1)

Authors: Sameh Khattab, Marie Bauer, Lukas Heine, Till Rostalski, Jens Kleesiek, Julian Friedrich

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has rapidly increased the need for high-quality, curated information retrieval datasets. These datasets, however, are currently created with off-the-shelf annotation tools that make the annotation process complex and inefficient. To streamline this process, we developed a specialized annotation tool - AIANO. By adopting an AI-augmented annotation workflow that tightly integrates human expertise with LLM assistance, AIANO enables annotators to leverage AI suggestions while retaining full control over annotation decisions. In a within-subject user study ($n = 15$), participants created question-answering datasets using both a baseline tool and AIANO. AIANO nearly doubled annotation speed compared to the baseline while being easier to use and improving retrieval accuracy. These results demonstrate that AIANO's AI-augmented approach accelerates and enhances dataset creation for information retrieval tasks, advancing annotation capabilities in retrieval-intensive domains.

Authors: Lorenz Wendlinger, Simon Alexander Nonn, Abdullah Al Zubaer, Michael Granitzer

Recent work has applied link prediction to large heterogeneous legal citation networks \new{with rich meta-features}. We find that this approach can be improved by including edge dropout and feature concatenation for the learning of more robust representations, which reduces error rates by up to 45%. We also propose an approach based on multilingual node features with an improved asymmetric decoder for compatibility, which allows us to generalize and extend the prediction to more, geographically and linguistically disjoint, data from New Zealand. Our adaptations also improve inductive transferability between these disjoint legal systems.

### 3. [Addressing Corpus Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on RAG Using Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04711v1)

Authors: Sagie Dekel, Moshe Tennenholtz, Oren Kurland

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a highly effective paradigm for keeping LLM-based responses up-to-date and reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. Yet, RAG was recently shown to be quite vulnerable to corpus knowledge poisoning: an attacker injects misleading documents to the corpus to steer an LLMs' output to an undesired response. We argue that the standard causal attention mechanism in LLMs enables harmful cross-document interactions, specifically in cases of attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a novel defense approach for RAG: Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG). This is a block-sparse attention mechanism that disallows cross-attention between retrieved documents. SDAG requires a minimal inference-time change to the attention mask; furthermore, no fine-tuning or additional architectural changes are needed. We present an empirical evaluation of LLM-based question answering (QA) with a variety of attack strategies on RAG. We show that our SDAG method substantially outperforms the standard causal attention mechanism in terms of attack success rate. We further demonstrate the clear merits of integrating SDAG with state-of-the-art RAG defense methods. Specifically, the integration results in performance that is statistically significantly better than the state-of-the-art.

### 4. [LILaC: Late Interacting in Layered Component Graph for Open-domain Multimodal Multihop Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04263v1)

Authors: Joohyung Yun, Doyup Lee, Wook-Shin Han

Multimodal document retrieval aims to retrieve query-relevant components from documents composed of textual, tabular, and visual elements. An effective multimodal retriever needs to handle two main challenges: (1) mitigate the effect of irrelevant contents caused by fixed, single-granular retrieval units, and (2) support multihop reasoning by effectively capturing semantic relationships among components within and across documents. To address these challenges, we propose LILaC, a multimodal retrieval framework featuring two core innovations. First, we introduce a layered component graph, explicitly representing multimodal information at two layers - each representing coarse and fine granularity - facilitating efficient yet precise reasoning. Second, we develop a late-interaction-based subgraph retrieval method, an edge-based approach that initially identifies coarse-grained nodes for efficient candidate generation, then performs fine-grained reasoning via late interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LILaC achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on all five benchmarks, notably without additional fine-tuning. We make the artifacts publicly available at github.com/joohyung00/lilac.

### 5. [From Data to Behavior: Predicting Unintended Model Behaviors Before Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04735v1)

Authors: Mengru Wang, Zhenqian Xu, Junfeng Fang, Yunzhi Yao, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang

Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.

### 6. [GenMRP: A Generative Multi-Route Planning Framework for Efficient and Personalized Real-Time Industrial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04174v1)

Authors: Chengzhang Wang, Chao Chen, Jun Tao, Tengfei Liu, He Bai, Song Wang, Longfei Xu, Kaikui Liu, Xiangxiang Chu

Existing industrial-scale navigation applications contend with massive road networks, typically employing two main categories of approaches for route planning. The first relies on precomputed road costs for optimal routing and heuristic algorithms for generating alternatives, while the second, generative methods, has recently gained significant attention. However, the former struggles with personalization and route diversity, while the latter fails to meet the efficiency requirements of large-scale real-time scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GenMRP, a generative framework for multi-route planning. To ensure generation efficiency, GenMRP first introduces a skeleton-to-capillary approach that dynamically constructs a relevant sub-network significantly smaller than the full road network. Within this sub-network, routes are generated iteratively. The first iteration identifies the optimal route, while the subsequent ones generate alternatives that balance quality and diversity using the newly proposed correctional boosting approach. Each iteration incorporates road features, user historical sequences, and previously generated routes into a Link Cost Model to update road costs, followed by route generation using the Dijkstra algorithm. Extensive experiments show that GenMRP achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency in both offline and online environments. To facilitate further research, we have publicly released the training and evaluation dataset. GenMRP has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness and benefits.

### 7. [SDR-CIR: Semantic Debias Retrieval Framework for Training-Free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04451v1)

Authors: Yi Sun, Jinyu Xu, Qing Xie, Jiachen Li, Yanchun Ma, Yongjian Liu

Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve a target image from a query composed of a reference image and modification text. Recent training-free zero-shot methods often employ Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to compose a target image description for retrieval. However, due to the fuzzy matching nature of ZS-CIR, the generated description is prone to semantic bias relative to the target image. We propose SDR-CIR, a training-free Semantic Debias Ranking method based on CoT reasoning. First, Selective CoT guides the MLLM to extract visual content relevant to the modification text during image understanding, thereby reducing visual noise at the source. We then introduce a Semantic Debias Ranking with two steps, Anchor and Debias, to mitigate semantic bias. In the Anchor step, we fuse reference image features with target description features to reinforce useful semantics and supplement omitted cues. In the Debias step, we explicitly model the visual semantic contribution of the reference image to the description and incorporate it into the similarity score as a penalty term. By supplementing omitted cues while suppressing redundancy, SDR-CIR mitigates semantic bias and improves retrieval performance. Experiments on three standard CIR benchmarks show that SDR-CIR achieves state-of-the-art results among one-stage methods while maintaining high efficiency. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/suny105/SDR-CIR.

Authors: Lin Wang, Yang Zhang, Jingfan Chen, Xiaoyan Zhao, Fengbin Zhu, Qing Li, Tat-Seng Chua

The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) into large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities for recommender systems by eliciting reasoning and improving user preference modeling. However, RL-based LLM recommendation faces significant efficiency challenges, making full-data training costly. Existing data selection methods define sample value based on learnability or representativeness, yet their loss- or gradient-driven or dataset coverage-driven criteria often misalign with RL learning dynamics, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose MiniRec, a data selection framework tailored for RL-based LLM recommendation. MiniRec evaluates sample learnability using key RL signals -- rewards -- pruning samples that are too easy (too high reward) or too difficult (consistently low reward). It assesses representativeness by aligning sample gradients with the approximated "ideal" global RL optimization trajectory, selecting samples that mainly drive model updates, and it also enforces diversity to reduce redundancy. Combined with a curriculum learning strategy from easy to hard samples, MiniRec significantly reduces training cost while largely preserving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate MiniRec's effectiveness, highlighting the importance of reward-aligned, trajectory-informed data selection in RL-based LLM recommendation.

Authors: Junjie Chen, Haitao Li, Qilei Zhang, Zhenghua Li, Ya Zhang, Quan Zhou, Cheng Luo, Yiqun Liu, Dongsheng Guo, Qingyao Ai

Legal judgment prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes from case facts and typically includes law article, charge, and sentencing prediction. While recent methods perform well on the first two subtasks, legal sentencing prediction (LSP) remains difficult due to its need for fine-grained objective knowledge and flexible subjective reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose $MSR^2$, a framework that integrates multi-source retrieval and reasoning in LLMs with reinforcement learning. $MSR^2$ enables LLMs to perform multi-source retrieval based on reasoning needs and applies a process-level reward to guide intermediate subjective reasoning steps. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that $MSR^2$ improves both accuracy and interpretability in LSP, providing a promising step toward practical legal AI. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MSR2-FC3B.

Authors: Aleksandr Poslavsky, Alexander D'yakonov, Yuriy Dorn, Andrey Zimovnov

Short-video recommendation presents unique challenges, such as modeling rapid user interest shifts from implicit feedback, but progress is constrained by a lack of large-scale open datasets that reflect real-world platform dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VK Large Short-Video Dataset (VK-LSVD), the largest publicly available industrial dataset of its kind. VK-LSVD offers an unprecedented scale of over 40 billion interactions from 10 million users and almost 20 million videos over six months, alongside rich features including content embeddings, diverse feedback signals, and contextual metadata. Our analysis supports the dataset's quality and diversity. The dataset's immediate impact is confirmed by its central role in the live VK RecSys Challenge 2025. VK-LSVD provides a vital, open dataset to use in building realistic benchmarks to accelerate research in sequential recommendation, cold-start scenarios, and next-generation recommender systems.

### Machine Learning

### 1. [Rethinking the Design Space of Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Models: On the Importance of Likelihood Estimation Beyond Loss Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04663v1)

Authors: Jaemoo Choi, Yuchen Zhu, Wei Guo, Petr Molodyk, Bo Yuan, Jinbin Bai, Yi Xin, Molei Tao, Yongxin Chen

Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to diffusion and flow models for visual tasks such as text-to-image generation. However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.

Authors: Chenxi Hu, Yue Ma, Yifan Wu, Yunhe Hou

Extreme weather can substantially change electricity consumption behavior, causing load curves to exhibit sharp spikes and pronounced volatility. If forecasts are inaccurate during those periods, power systems are more likely to face supply shortfalls or localized overloads, forcing emergency actions such as load shedding and increasing the risk of service disruptions and public-safety impacts. This problem is inherently difficult because extreme events can trigger abrupt regime shifts in load patterns, while relevant extreme samples are rare and irregular, making reliable learning and calibration challenging. We propose AdaCNP, a probabilistic forecasting model for data-scarce condition. AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space. For each target data, it evaluates how relevant each historical context segment is to the current condition and reweights the context information accordingly. This design highlights the most informative historical evidence even when extreme samples are rare. It enables few-shot adaptation to previously unseen extreme patterns. AdaCNP also produces predictive distributions for risk-aware decision-making without expensive fine-tuning on the target domain. We evaluate AdaCNP on real-world power-system load data and compare it against a range of representative baselines. The results show that AdaCNP is more robust during extreme periods, reducing the mean squared error by 22\% relative to the strongest baseline while achieving the lowest negative log-likelihood, indicating more reliable probabilistic outputs. These findings suggest that AdaCNP can effectively mitigate the combined impact of abrupt distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, providing a more trustworthy forecasting for resilient power system operation under extreme events.

### 3. [A principled framework for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04596v1)

Authors: Sandra Fortini, Kenyon Ng, Sonia Petrone, Judith Rousseau, Susan Wei

TabPFN is a transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance on supervised tabular tasks by amortizing Bayesian prediction into a single forward pass. However, there is currently no method for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN. Because it behaves, in an idealised limit, as a Bayesian in-context learner, we cast the decomposition challenge as a Bayesian predictive inference (BPI) problem. The main computational tool in BPI, predictive Monte Carlo, is challenging to apply here as it requires simulating unmodeled covariates. We therefore pursue the asymptotic alternative, filling a gap in the theory for supervised settings by proving a predictive CLT under quasi-martingale conditions. We derive variance estimators determined by the volatility of predictive updates along the context. The resulting credible bands are fast to compute, target epistemic uncertainty, and achieve near-nominal frequentist coverage. For classification, we further obtain an entropy-based uncertainty decomposition.

### 4. [LORE: Jointly Learning the Intrinsic Dimensionality and Relative Similarity Structure From Ordinal Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04192v1)

Authors: Vivek Anand, Alec Helbling, Mark Davenport, Gordon Berman, Sankar Alagapan, Christopher Rozell

Learning the intrinsic dimensionality of subjective perceptual spaces such as taste, smell, or aesthetics from ordinal data is a challenging problem. We introduce LORE (Low Rank Ordinal Embedding), a scalable framework that jointly learns both the intrinsic dimensionality and an ordinal embedding from noisy triplet comparisons of the form, "Is A more similar to B than C?". Unlike existing methods that require the embedding dimension to be set apriori, LORE regularizes the solution using the nonconvex Schatten-$p$ quasi norm, enabling automatic joint recovery of both the ordinal embedding and its dimensionality. We optimize this joint objective via an iteratively reweighted algorithm and establish convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, simulated perceptual spaces, and real world crowdsourced ordinal judgements show that LORE learns compact, interpretable and highly accurate low dimensional embeddings that recover the latent geometry of subjective percepts. By simultaneously inferring both the intrinsic dimensionality and ordinal embeddings, LORE enables more interpretable and data efficient perceptual modeling in psychophysics and opens new directions for scalable discovery of low dimensional structure from ordinal data in machine learning.

### 5. [Toward Effective Multimodal Graph Foundation Model: A Divide-and-Conquer Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04116v1)

Authors: Sicheng Liu, Xunkai Li, Daohan Su, Ru Zhang, Hongchao Qin, Ronghua Li, Guoren Wang

Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have achieved remarkable success in generalizing across diverse domains. However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.

### 6. [Turning mechanistic models into forecasters by using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04114v1)

Authors: Amit K. Chakraborty, Hao Wang, Pouria Ramazi

The equations of complex dynamical systems may not be identified by expert knowledge, especially if the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Data-driven discovery methods address this challenge by inferring governing equations from time-series data using a library of functions constructed from the measured variables. However, these methods typically assume time-invariant coefficients, which limits their ability to capture evolving system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we allow some of the parameters to vary over time, learn their temporal evolution directly from data, and infer a system of equations that incorporates both constant and time-varying parameters. We then transform this framework into a forecasting model by predicting the time-varying parameters and substituting these predictions into the learned equations. The model is validated using datasets for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, Consumer--Resource, greenhouse gas concentration, and Cyanobacteria cell count. By dynamically adapting to temporal shifts, our proposed model achieved a mean absolute error below 3\% for learning a time series and below 6\% for forecasting up to a month ahead. We additionally compare forecasting performance against CNN-LSTM and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and show that our model outperforms these methods across most datasets. Our findings demonstrate that integrating time-varying parameters into data-driven discovery of differential equations improves both modeling accuracy and forecasting performance.

Authors: Nikolas Melissaris, Jiayi Xu, Antigoni Polychroniadou, Akira Takahashi, Chenkai Weng

Gradient boosted decision trees, particularly XGBoost, are among the most effective methods for tabular data. As deployment in sensitive settings increases, cryptographic guarantees of model integrity become essential. We present ZKBoost, the first zero-knowledge proof of training (zkPoT) protocol for XGBoost, enabling model owners to prove correct training on a committed dataset without revealing data or parameters. We make three key contributions: (1) a fixed-point XGBoost implementation compatible with arithmetic circuits, enabling instantiation of efficient zkPoT, (2) a generic template of zkPoT for XGBoost, which can be instantiated with any general-purpose ZKP backend, and (3) vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE)-based instantiation resolving challenges in proving nonlinear fixed-point operations. Our fixed-point implementation matches standard XGBoost accuracy within 1\% while enabling practical zkPoT on real-world datasets.

Authors: Ali Mohammad-Djafari

The main contribution of this paper is to develop a hierarchical Bayesian formulation of PINNs for linear inverse problems, which is called BPINN-IP. The proposed methodology extends PINN to account for prior knowledge on the nature of the expected NN output, as well as its weights. Also, as we can have access to the posterior probability distributions, naturally uncertainties can be quantified. Also, variational inference and Monte Carlo dropout are employed to provide predictive means and variances for reconstructed images. Un example of applications to deconvolution and super-resolution is considered, details of the different steps of implementations are given, and some preliminary results are presented.

### 9. [Hand Gesture Recognition from Doppler Radar Signals Using Echo State Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04436v1)

Authors: Towa Sano, Gouhei Tanaka

Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is a fundamental technology in human computer interaction (HCI).In particular, HGR based on Doppler radar signals is suited for in-vehicle interfaces and robotic systems, necessitating lightweight and computationally efficient recognition techniques. However, conventional deep learning-based methods still suffer from high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based HGR, using frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signals. Raw radar data is first converted into feature maps, such as range-time and Doppler-time maps, which are then fed into one or more recurrent neural network-based reservoirs. The obtained reservoir states are processed by readout classifiers, including ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on an 11-class HGR task using the Soli dataset and surpasses existing deep learning models on a 4-class HGR task using the Dop-NET dataset. The results indicate that parallel processing using multi-reservoir ESNs are effective for recognizing temporal patterns from the multiple different feature maps in the time-space and time-frequency domains. Our ESN approaches achieve high recognition performance with low computational cost in HGR, showing great potential for more advanced HCI technologies, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Authors: Ansu Mathew, Ahmer A. B. Baloch, Alamin Yakasai, Hemant Mittal, Vivian Alberts, Jayakumar V. Karunamurthy

Prediction of crystal system from X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra is a critical task in materials science, particularly for perovskite materials which are known for their diverse applications in photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and catalysis. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML)-driven framework that leverages advanced models, including Time Series Forest (TSF), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a simple feedforward neural network (NN), to classify crystal systems, point groups, and space groups from XRD data of perovskite materials. To address class imbalance and enhance model robustness, we integrated feature augmentation strategies such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), class weighting, jittering, and spectrum shifting, along with efficient data preprocessing pipelines. The TSF model with SMOTE augmentation achieved strong performance for crystal system prediction, with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9, an F1 score of 0.92, and an accuracy of 97.76%. For point and space group prediction, balanced accuracies above 95% were obtained. The model demonstrated high performance for symmetry-distinct classes, including cubic crystal systems, point groups 3m and m-3m, and space groups Pnma and Pnnn. This work highlights the potential of ML for XRD-based structural characterization and accelerated discovery of perovskite materials

Authors: Haoran Yin, Shuaiqun Pan, Zhao Wei, Jian Cheng Wong, Yew-Soon Ong, Anna V. Kononova, Thomas Bäck, Niki van Stein

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in automated algorithm design, giving rise to numerous powerful methods. However, these approaches retain critical limitations: they require extensive evaluation of the target problem to guide the search process, making them impractical for real-world optimization tasks, where each evaluation consumes substantial computational resources. This research proposes an innovative and efficient framework that decouples algorithm discovery from high-cost evaluation. Our core innovation lies in combining a Genetic Programming (GP) function generator with an LLM-driven evolutionary algorithm designer. The evolutionary direction of the GP-based function generator is guided by the similarity between the landscape characteristics of generated proxy functions and those of real-world problems, ensuring that algorithms discovered via proxy functions exhibit comparable performance on real-world problems. Our method enables deep exploration of the algorithmic space before final validation while avoiding costly real-world evaluations. We validated the framework's efficacy across multiple real-world problems, demonstrating its ability to discover high-performance algorithms while substantially reducing expensive evaluations. This approach shows a path to apply LLM-based automated algorithm design to computationally intensive real-world optimization challenges.

### 2. [Real-time processing of analog signals on accelerated neuromorphic hardware](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04582v1)

Authors: Yannik Stradmann, Johannes Schemmel, Mihai A. Petrovici, Laura Kriener

Sensory processing with neuromorphic systems is typically done by using either event-based sensors or translating input signals to spikes before presenting them to the neuromorphic processor. Here, we offer an alternative approach: direct analog signal injection eliminates superfluous and power-intensive analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions, making it particularly suitable for efficient near-sensor processing. We demonstrate this by using the accelerated BrainScaleS-2 mixed-signal neuromorphic research platform and interfacing it directly to microphones and a servo-motor-driven actuator. Utilizing BrainScaleS-2's 1000-fold acceleration factor, we employ a spiking neural network to transform interaural time differences into a spatial code and thereby predict the location of sound sources. Our primary contributions are the first demonstrations of direct, continuous-valued sensor data injection into the analog compute units of the BrainScaleS-2 ASIC, and actuator control using its embedded microprocessors. This enables a fully on-chip processing pipeline$\unicode{x2014}$from sensory input handling, via spiking neural network processing to physical action. We showcase this by programming the system to localize and align a servo motor with the spatial direction of transient noise peaks in real-time.

Authors: Amadeu A. Coco, Cyprien Borée, Julien Baste, Laetitia Jourdan, Lucien Mousin

This work tackles two critical challenges related to the development of metaheuristics for Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (MOOPs): the exponential growth of non-dominated solutions and the tendency of metaheuristics to disproportionately concentrate their search on a subset of the Pareto Front. To counteract the first, bounded archives are employed as a strategic mechanism for effectively managing the increasing number of non-dominated solutions. Addressing the second challenge involves an in-depth exploration of solution diversity algorithms found in existing literature. Upon recognizing that current approaches predominantly center on diversity within the objective space, this research introduces innovative methods specifically designed to enhance diversity in the solution space. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the Hamming Distance Archiving Algorithm, one of the newly proposed algorithms for multi-objective local search, surpassing the performance of the Adaptive Grid Archiving and the Hypervolume Archiving, both drawn from the literature. This outcome suggests a promising avenue for enhancing the overall efficiency of metaheuristics employed for solving MOOPs.

Authors: Alessandro Pierro, Jonathan Timcheck, Jason Yik, Marius Lindauer, Eyke Hüllermeier, Marcel Wever

Spatial accelerators, composed of arrays of compute-memory integrated units, offer an attractive platform for deploying inference workloads with low latency and low energy consumption. However, fully exploiting their architectural advantages typically requires careful, expert-driven mapping of computational graphs to distributed processing elements. In this work, we automate this process by framing the mapping challenge as a black-box optimization problem. We introduce the first evolutionary, hardware-in-the-loop mapping framework for neuromorphic accelerators, enabling users without deep hardware knowledge to deploy workloads more efficiently. We evaluate our approach on Intel Loihi 2, a representative spatial accelerator featuring 152 cores per chip in a 2D mesh. Our method achieves up to 35% reduction in total latency compared to default heuristics on two sparse multi-layer perceptron networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to multi-chip systems and observe an up to 40% improvement in energy efficiency, without explicitly optimizing for it.

Authors: Hannah Pinson

Our theoretical understanding of neural networks is lagging behind their empirical success. One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.

Authors: Yufei Ye, Shijian Gao, Xinhu Zheng, Liuqing Yang

The agile mobility of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) makes them ideal for low-altitude edge computing. This paper proposes a novel multi-tier UAV edge computing system where lightweight Low-Tier UAVs (L-UAVs) function as edge servers for vehicle users, supported by a powerful High-Tier UAV (H-UAV) acting as a backup server. The objective is to minimize task execution delays while ensuring the long-term energy stability of the L-UAVs, despite unknown future system states. To this end, the problem is decoupled using Lyapunov optimization, which adaptively balances the priorities of task delays and L-UAV energy cost based on their real-time energy states. An efficient vehicle to L-UAV matching scheme is designed, and the joint optimization problem for task assignment, computing resource allocation, and trajectory control of L-UAVs and H-UAV is then solved via a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate a reduction in L-UAV transmission energy of over 26% and superior L-UAV energy stability compared to existing benchmarks.

### 2. [On Dual Connectivity in 6G Leo Constellations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04825v1)

Authors: Achilles Machumilane, Alberto Gotta

Dual connectivity (DC) has garnered significant attention in 5G evolution, allowing for enhancing throughput and reliability by leveraging the channel conditions of two paths. However, when the paths exhibit different delays, such as in terrestrial and non-terrestrial integrated networks with multi-orbit topologies or in networks characterized by frequent topology changes, like Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations with different elevation angles, traffic delivery may experience packet reordering or triggering congestion control mechanisms. Additionally, real-time traffic may experience packet drops if their arrival exceeds a play-out threshold. Different techniques have been proposed to address these issues, such as packet duplication, packet switching, and network coding for traffic scheduling in DC. However, if not accurately designed, these techniques can lead to resource waste, encoding/decoding delays, and computational overhead, undermining DC's intended benefits. This paper provides a mathematical framework for calculating the average end-to-end packet loss in case of a loss process modeled with a Discrete Markov Chain - typical of a wireless channel - when combining packet duplication and packet switching or when network coding is employed in DC. Such metrics help derive optimal policies with full knowledge of the underlying loss process to be compared to empirical models learned through Machine Learning algorithms.

Authors: Bowen Tan, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Kezhi Wang, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen

This letter proposes a novel three-tier content caching architecture for Vehicular Fog Caching (VFC)-assisted platoon, where the VFC is formed by the vehicles driving near the platoon. The system strategically coordinates storage across local platoon vehicles, dynamic VFC clusters, and cloud server (CS) to minimize content retrieval latency. To efficiently manage distributed storage, we integrate large language models (LLMs) for real-time and intelligent caching decisions. The proposed approach leverages LLMs' ability to process heterogeneous information, including user profiles, historical data, content characteristics, and dynamic system states. Through a designed prompting framework encoding task objectives and caching constraints, the LLMs formulate caching as a decision-making task, and our hierarchical deterministic caching mapping strategy enables adaptive requests prediction and precise content placement across three tiers without frequent retraining. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed caching scheme.

### 4. [Dual Mind World Model Inspired Network Digital Twin for Access Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04566v1)

Authors: Hrishikesh Dutta, Roberto Minerva, Noel Crespi

Emerging networked systems such as industrial IoT and real-time cyber-physical infrastructures demand intelligent scheduling strategies capable of adapting to dynamic traffic, deadlines, and interference constraints. In this work, we present a novel Digital Twin-enabled scheduling framework inspired by Dual Mind World Model (DMWM) architecture, for learning-informed and imagination-driven network control. Unlike conventional rule-based or purely data-driven policies, the proposed DMWM combines short-horizon predictive planning with symbolic model-based rollout, enabling the scheduler to anticipate future network states and adjust transmission decisions accordingly. We implement the framework in a configurable simulation testbed and benchmark its performance against traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning baselines under varied traffic conditions. Our results show that DMWM achieves superior performance in bursty, interference-limited, and deadline-sensitive environments, while maintaining interpretability and sample efficiency. The proposed design bridges the gap between network-level reasoning and low-overhead learning, marking a step toward scalable and adaptive NDT-based network optimization.

Authors: Rajendra Paudyal, Rajendra Upadhyay, Al Nahian Bin Emran, Lisa Donnan, Duminda Wijesekera

Denial-of-Service (DoS) conditions in enterprise networks are commonly attributed to malicious actors. However, availability can also be compromised by benign non-malicious insider behavior. This paper presents an empirical study of a production enterprise LAN that demonstrates how routine docking and undocking of user endpoints repeatedly trigger rapid recalculations of the control plane of the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) [1]. Although protocol-compliant and nonmalicious, these events introduce transient forwarding disruptions of approximately 2-4 seconds duration that degrade realtime streaming (voice and video) services while remaining largely undetected by conventional security monitoring. We map this phenomenon to the NIST and MITRE insider threat frameworks, characterizing it as an unintentional insider-driven availability breach, and demonstrate that explicit edge-port configuration effectively mitigates the condition without compromising loop prevention

Authors: Heqing Yang, Ziyuan Jiao, Shu Wang, Yida Niu, Si Liu, Hangxin Liu

In partially known environments, robots must combine exploration to gather information with task planning for efficient execution. To address this challenge, we propose EPoG, an Exploration-based sequential manipulation Planning framework on Scene Graphs. EPoG integrates a graph-based global planner with a Large Language Model (LLM)-based situated local planner, continuously updating a belief graph using observations and LLM predictions to represent known and unknown objects. Action sequences are generated by computing graph edit operations between the goal and belief graphs, ordered by temporal dependencies and movement costs. This approach seamlessly combines exploration and sequential manipulation planning. In ablation studies across 46 realistic household scenes and 5 long-horizon daily object transportation tasks, EPoG achieved a success rate of 91.3%, reducing travel distance by 36.1% on average. Furthermore, a physical mobile manipulator successfully executed complex tasks in unknown and dynamic environments, demonstrating EPoG's potential for real-world applications.

Authors: Shuo Pei, Yong Wang, Yuanchen Zhu, Chen Sun, Qin Li, Yanan Zhao, Huachun Tan

Achieving safe and stylized trajectory planning in complex real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO. Real-vehicle closed-loop tests further confirm that SDD Planner maintains high safety standards while aligning with preset driving styles, validating its practical applicability for real-world deployment.

Authors: Rui Tang, Guankun Wang, Long Bai, Huxin Gao, Jiewen Lai, Chi Kit Ng, Jiazheng Wang, Fan Zhang, Hongliang Ren

Language-guided grasping has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling robots to identify and manipulate target objects through natural language instructions, yet it remains highly challenging in cluttered or occluded scenes. Existing methods often rely on multi-stage pipelines that separate object perception and grasping, which leads to limited cross-modal fusion, redundant computation, and poor generalization in cluttered, occluded, or low-texture scenes. To address these limitations, we propose GeoLanG, an end-to-end multi-task framework built upon the CLIP architecture that unifies visual and linguistic inputs into a shared representation space for robust semantic alignment and improved generalization. To enhance target discrimination under occlusion and low-texture conditions, we explore a more effective use of depth information through the Depth-guided Geometric Module (DGGM), which converts depth into explicit geometric priors and injects them into the attention mechanism without additional computational overhead. In addition, we propose Adaptive Dense Channel Integration, which adaptively balances the contributions of multi-layer features to produce more discriminative and generalizable visual representations. Extensive experiments on the OCID-VLG dataset, as well as in both simulation and real-world hardware, demonstrate that GeoLanG enables precise and robust language-guided grasping in complex, cluttered environments, paving the way toward more reliable multimodal robotic manipulation in real-world human-centric settings.

### 4. [TACO: Temporal Consensus Optimization for Continual Neural Mapping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04516v1)

Authors: Xunlan Zhou, Hongrui Zhao, Negar Mehr

Neural implicit mapping has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic navigation and scene understanding. However, real-world robotic deployment requires continual adaptation to changing environments under strict memory and computation constraints, which existing mapping systems fail to support. Most prior methods rely on replaying historical observations to preserve consistency and assume static scenes. As a result, they cannot adapt to continual learning in dynamic robotic settings. To address these challenges, we propose TACO (TemporAl Consensus Optimization), a replay-free framework for continual neural mapping. We reformulate mapping as a temporal consensus optimization problem, where we treat past model snapshots as temporal neighbors. Intuitively, our approach resembles a model consulting its own past knowledge. We update the current map by enforcing weighted consensus with historical representations. Our method allows reliable past geometry to constrain optimization while permitting unreliable or outdated regions to be revised in response to new observations. TACO achieves a balance between memory efficiency and adaptability without storing or replaying previous data. Through extensive simulated and real-world experiments, we show that TACO robustly adapts to scene changes, and consistently outperforms other continual learning baselines.

Authors: Jiaye Li, Tongshun Chen, Siyi Ma, Elizabeth Churchill, Ke Wu

We introduce PuppetAI, a modular soft robot interaction platform. This platform offers a scalable cable-driven actuation system and a customizable, puppet-inspired robot gesture framework, supporting a multitude of interaction gesture robot design formats. The platform comprises a four-layer decoupled software architecture that includes perceptual processing, affective modeling, motion scheduling, and low-level actuation. We also implemented an affective expression loop that connects human input to the robot platform by producing real-time emotional gestural responses to human vocal input. For our own designs, we have worked with nuanced gestures enacted by "soft robots" with enhanced dexterity and "pleasant-to-touch" plush exteriors. By reducing operational complexity and production costs while enhancing customizability, our work creates an adaptable and accessible foundation for future tactile-based expressive robot research. Our goal is to provide a platform that allows researchers to independently construct or refine highly specific gestures and movements performed by social robots.

Authors: Pengfei Yi, Yifan Han, Junyan Li, Litao Liu, Wenzhao Lian

Robotic manipulation continues to be a challenge, and imitation learning (IL) enables robots to learn tasks from expert demonstrations. Current IL methods typically rely on fixed camera setups, where cameras are manually positioned in static locations, imposing significant limitations on adaptability and coverage. Inspired by human active perception, where humans dynamically adjust their viewpoint to capture the most relevant and least noisy information, we propose MAE-Select, a novel framework for active viewpoint selection in single-camera robotic systems. MAE-Select fully leverages pre-trained multi-view masked autoencoder representations and dynamically selects the next most informative viewpoint at each time chunk without requiring labeled viewpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAE-Select improves the capabilities of single-camera systems and, in some cases, even surpasses multi-camera setups. The project will be available at https://mae-select.github.io.

### 7. [Radar-Inertial Odometry For Computationally Constrained Aerial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04631v1)

Authors: Jan Michalczyk

Recently, the progress in the radar sensing technology consisting in the miniaturization of the packages and increase in measuring precision has drawn the interest of the robotics research community. Indeed, a crucial task enabling autonomy in robotics is to precisely determine the pose of the robot in space. To fulfill this task sensor fusion algorithms are often used, in which data from one or several exteroceptive sensors like, for example, LiDAR, camera, laser ranging sensor or GNSS are fused together with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to obtain an estimate of the navigation states of the robot. Nonetheless, owing to their particular sensing principles, some exteroceptive sensors are often incapacitated in extreme environmental conditions, like extreme illumination or presence of fine particles in the environment like smoke or fog. Radars are largely immune to aforementioned factors thanks to the characteristics of electromagnetic waves they use. In this thesis, we present Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms to fuse the information from IMU and radar in order to estimate the navigation states of a (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) UAV capable of running on a portable resource-constrained embedded computer in real-time and making use of inexpensive, consumer-grade sensors. We present novel RIO approaches relying on the multi-state tightly-coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Factor Graphs (FG) fusing instantaneous velocities of and distances to 3D points delivered by a lightweight, low-cost, off-the-shelf Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with IMU readings. We also show a novel way to exploit advances in deep learning to retrieve 3D point correspondences in sparse and noisy radar point clouds.

Authors: Jialiang Li, Yi Qiao, Yunhan Guo, Changwen Chen, Wenzhao Lian

Achieving generalizable manipulation in unconstrained environments requires the robot to proactively resolve information uncertainty, i.e., the capability of active perception. However, existing methods are often confined in limited types of sensing behaviors, restricting their applicability to complex environments. In this work, we formalize active perception as a non-Markovian process driven by information gain and decision branching, providing a structured categorization of visual active perception paradigms. Building on this perspective, we introduce CoMe-VLA, a cognitive and memory-aware vision-language-action (VLA) framework that leverages large-scale human egocentric data to learn versatile exploration and manipulation priors. Our framework integrates a cognitive auxiliary head for autonomous sub-task transitions and a dual-track memory system to maintain consistent self and environmental awareness by fusing proprioceptive and visual temporal contexts. By aligning human and robot hand-eye coordination behaviors in a unified egocentric action space, we train the model progressively in three stages. Extensive experiments on a wheel-based humanoid have demonstrated strong robustness and adaptability of our proposed method across diverse long-horizon tasks spanning multiple active perception scenarios.

### 9. [Quantile Transfer for Reliable Operating Point Selection in Visual Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04401v1)

Authors: Dhyey Manish Rajani, Michael Milford, Tobias Fischer

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a key component for localisation in GNSS-denied environments, but its performance critically depends on selecting an image matching threshold (operating point) that balances precision and recall. Thresholds are typically hand-tuned offline for a specific environment and fixed during deployment, leading to degraded performance under environmental change. We propose a method that, given a user-defined precision requirement, automatically selects the operating point of a VPR system to maximise recall. The method uses a small calibration traversal with known correspondences and transfers thresholds to deployment via quantile normalisation of similarity score distributions. This quantile transfer ensures that thresholds remain stable across calibration sizes and query subsets, making the method robust to sampling variability. Experiments with multiple state-of-the-art VPR techniques and datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering up to 25% higher recall in high-precision operating regimes. The method eliminates manual tuning by adapting to new environments and generalising across operating conditions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

### 10. [OAT: Ordered Action Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04215v1)

Authors: Chaoqi Liu, Xiaoshen Han, Jiawei Gao, Yue Zhao, Haonan Chen, Yilun Du

Autoregressive policies offer a compelling foundation for scalable robot learning by enabling discrete abstraction, token-level reasoning, and flexible inference. However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.

Authors: Matias Martinez, Xavier Franch

The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been fueled by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate repair systems using real issues mined from popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards-SWE-Bench Lite and Verified-have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of these two leaderboards, examining who is submitting solutions, the products behind the submissions, the LLMs employed, and the openness of the approaches. We analyze 79 entries submitted to Lite leaderboard and 133 to Verified. Our results show that most entries on both leaderboards originate from industry, particularly small companies and large publicly traded companies. These submissions often achieve top results, although academic contributions-typically open source-also remain competitive. We also find a clear dominance of proprietary LLMs, especially Claude family, with state-of-the-art results on both leaderboards currently achieved by Claude 4 Sonnet. These findings offer insights into the SWE-Bench ecosystem that can guide greater transparency and diversity in future benchmark-driven research.

### 2. [SPEAR: An Engineering Case Study of Multi-Agent Coordination for Smart Contract Auditing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04418v1)

Authors: Arnab Mallick, Indraveni Chebolu, Harmesh Rana

We present SPEAR, a multi-agent coordination framework for smart contract auditing that applies established MAS patterns in a realistic security analysis workflow. SPEAR models auditing as a coordinated mission carried out by specialized agents: a Planning Agent prioritizes contracts using risk-aware heuristics, an Execution Agent allocates tasks via the Contract Net protocol, and a Repair Agent autonomously recovers from brittle generated artifacts using a programmatic-first repair policy. Agents maintain local beliefs updated through AGM-compliant revision, coordinate via negotiation and auction protocols, and revise plans as new information becomes available. An empirical study compares the multi-agent design with centralized and pipeline-based alternatives under controlled failure scenarios, focusing on coordination, recovery behavior, and resource use.

Authors: Vasudha Malhotra, Rhea D'silva, Rashina Hoda

Despite their critical role in shaping student learning in computing education, the contributions of women teaching-support staff (TSS) often go unrecognised and undervalued. In this experience report, we synthesise lived experiences of 15 women TSS in IT/SE higher education to illuminate how authority is earned, resisted, and maintained in everyday teaching. Participants shared both their positive and negative lived experiences associated with finding and losing voice with teaching team colleagues on the one hand, and rewarding connections and gendered friction with students on the other. We map these dynamics onto an intersectional "wheel of privilege and power" tailored to TSS roles. The farther a TSS profile sits from the wheel's center (e.g., non-native English, non-white, younger-seeming, non-permanent, early-career), the more relational, emotional, and disciplinary labour is needed to reach parity. We provide actionable insights and recommendations for creating more inclusive education environments in technology dominant fields that are particularly timely as universities worldwide grapple with post-pandemic teaching models and seek to build more inclusive and resilient academic communities.

Authors: Wenjun Peng, Xinyu Wang, Qi Wu

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated code generation, yet the evaluation of their real-world effectiveness remains limited by static benchmarks and simplistic metrics. We present ProxyWar, a novel framework that systematically assesses code generation quality by embedding LLM-generated agents within diverse, competitive game environments. Unlike existing approaches, ProxyWar evaluates not only functional correctness but also the operational characteristics of generated programs, combining automated testing, iterative code repair, and multi-agent tournaments to provide a holistic view of program behavior. Applied to a range of state-of-the-art coders and games, our approach uncovers notable discrepancies between benchmark scores and actual performance in dynamic settings, revealing overlooked limitations and opportunities for improvement. These findings highlight the need for richer, competition-based evaluation of code generation. Looking forward, ProxyWar lays a foundation for research into LLM-driven algorithm discovery, adaptive problem solving, and the study of practical efficiency and robustness, including the potential for models to outperform hand-crafted agents. The project is available at https://github.com/xinke-wang/ProxyWar.

### 5. [Demonstrating ARG-V's Generation of Realistic Java Benchmarks for SV-COMP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04786v1)

Authors: Charles Moloney, Robert Dyer, Elena Sherman

The SV-COMP competition provides a state-of-the-art platform for evaluating software verification tools on a standardized set of verification tasks. Consequently, verifier development outcomes are influenced by the composition of program benchmarks included in SV-COMP. When expanding this benchmark corpus, it is crucial to consider whether newly added programs cause verifiers to exhibit behavior distinct from that observed on existing benchmarks. Doing so helps mitigate external threats to the validity of the competition's results.
  In this paper, we present the application of the ARG-V tool for automatically generating Java verification benchmarks in the SV-COMP format. We demonstrate that, on a newly generated set of 68 realistic benchmarks, all four leading Java verifiers decrease in accuracy and recall compared to their performance on the existing benchmark suite. These findings highlight the potential of ARG-V to enhance the comprehensiveness and realism of verification tool evaluation, while also providing a roadmap for verifier developers aiming to improve their tools' applicability to real-world software.

### 6. [A Framework of Critical Success Factors for Agile Software Development](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04467v1)

Authors: Ridewaan Hanslo, Maureen Tanner

Despite the popularity of Agile software development, achieving consistent project success remains challenging. This systematic literature review identifies critical success factors (CSFs) in Agile projects by analyzing 53 primary studies. Employing thematic synthesis with content analysis, our analysis yielded 21 CSFs categorized into five themes: organizational, people, technical, process, and project. Team effectiveness and project management emerged as the most frequently cited CSFs, highlighting the importance of people and process factors. These interpreted themes and factors contributed to the development of a theoretical framework to identify how these factors contribute to project success. This study offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, guiding future research to validate these findings and test the proposed framework using quantitative methods.

### 7. [Semantic Consensus Decoding: Backdoor Defense for Verilog Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04195v1)

Authors: Guang Yang, Xing Hu, Xiang Chen, Xin Xia

Large language models (LLMs) for Verilog code generation are increasingly adopted in hardware design, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks where adversaries inject malicious triggers during training to induce vulnerable hardware designs. Unlike patchable software vulnerabilities, hardware trojans become irreversible once fabricated, making remediation extremely costly or impossible. Existing active defenses require access to training data, impractical for third-party LLM users, while passive defenses struggle against semantically stealthy triggers that naturally blend into design specifications. In this paper, we hypothesize that under the requirements of both effectiveness and stealthiness, attackers are strongly biased toward embedding triggers in non-functional requirements (e.g., style modifiers, quality descriptors) rather than functional specifications that determine hardware behavior. Exploiting this insight, we propose Semantic Consensus Decoding (SCD), an inference-time passive defense with two key components: (1) functional requirement extraction that identifies essential requirements from user specifications, and (2) consensus decoding that adaptively fuses output distributions based on full user specifications and extracted functional requirements. When these distributions diverge significantly, SCD automatically suppresses suspicious components. Extensive experiments with three representative backdoor attacks demonstrate that SCD reduces average attack success rate from 89% to under 3% with negligible impact on generation quality.

Authors: Suyu Ma, Chunyang Chen, Hourieh Khalajzadeh, John Grundy

Stack Overflow is a popular Q&A platform where users ask technical questions and receive answers from a community of experts. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of answers generated by ChatGPT, which can lead to incorrect and unreliable information being posted on the site. While Stack Overflow has banned such AI-generated content, detecting whether a post is ChatGPT-generated remains a challenging task. We introduce a novel approach, SOGPTSpotter, that employs Siamese Neural Networks, leveraging the BigBird model and the Triplet loss, to detect ChatGPT-generated answers on Stack Overflow. We use triplets of human answers, reference answers, and ChatGPT answers. Our empirical evaluation reveals that our approach outperforms well-established baselines like GPTZero, DetectGPT, GLTR, BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 in identifying ChatGPT-synthesized Stack Overflow responses. We also conducted an ablation study to show the effectiveness of our model. Additional experiments were conducted to assess various factors, including the impact of text length, the model's robustness against adversarial attacks, and its generalization capabilities across different domains and large language models. We also conducted a real-world case study on Stack Overflow. Using our tool's recommendations, Stack Overflow moderators were able to identify and take down ChatGPT-suspected generated answers, demonstrating the practical applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

Authors: Derin Gezgin, Amartya Das, Shinhae Kim, Zhengdong Huang, Nevena Stojkovic, Claire Wang

Recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used in security vulnerability detection tasks including generating proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits. A PoC exploit is a program used to demonstrate how a vulnerability can be exploited. Several approaches suggest that supporting LLMs with additional guidance can improve PoC generation outcomes, motivating further evaluation of their effectiveness. In this work, we develop PoC-Gym, a framework for PoC generation for Java security vulnerabilities via LLMs and systematic validation of generated exploits. Using PoC-Gym, we evaluate whether the guidance from static analysis tools improves the PoC generation success rate and manually inspect the resulting PoCs. Our results from running PoC-Gym with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-5 Medium, and gpt-oss-20b show that using static analysis for guidance and criteria lead to 21% higher success rates than the prior baseline, FaultLine. However, manual inspection of both successful and failed PoCs reveals that 71.5% of the PoCs are invalid. These results show that the reported success of LLM-based PoC generation can be significantly misleading, which is hard to detect with current validation mechanisms.

Authors: Rudra Dhar, Karthik Vaidhyanathan, Vasudeva Varma

Architecture Knowledge Management (AKM) is crucial for maintaining current and comprehensive software Architecture Knowledge (AK) in a software project. However AKM is often a laborious process and is not adopted by developers and architects. While LLMs present an opportunity for automation, a naive, single-prompt approach is often ineffective, constrained by context limits and an inability to grasp the distributed nature of architectural knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic approach for AKM, AgenticAKM, where the complex problem of architecture recovery and documentation is decomposed into manageable sub-tasks. Specialized agents for architecture Extraction, Retrieval, Generation, and Validation collaborate in a structured workflow to generate AK. To validate we made an initial instantiation of our approach to generate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) from code repositories. We validated our approach through a user study with 29 repositories. The results demonstrate that our agentic approach generates better ADRs, and is a promising and practical approach for automating AKM.

Authors: Sicheng Liu, Xunkai Li, Daohan Su, Ru Zhang, Hongchao Qin, Ronghua Li, Guoren Wang

Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have achieved remarkable success in generalizing across diverse domains. However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.

### 2. [Opinion dynamics under electoral shocks in competitive campaigns](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04829v1)

Authors: Jaime L. C. da C. Filho, Nuno Crokidakis

We propose a computational framework for modeling opinion dynamics in electoral competitions that combines two realistic features: voter memory and exogenous shocks. The population is represented by a fully-connected network of agents, each holding a binary opinion that reflects support for one of two candidates. First, inspired by the classical voter model, we introduce a memory-dependent opinion update: each agent's probability of adopting a neighbor's stance depends on how many times they agreed with that neighbor in the agent's past $m$ states, promoting inertia and resistance to change. Second, we define an electoral shock as an abrupt external influence acting uniformly over all agents during a finite interval $[t_0, t_0+Δt]$, favoring one candidate by switching opinions with probability $p_s$, representing the impact of extraordinary events such as political scandals, impactful speeches, or sudden news. We explore how the strength and duration of the shock, in conjunction with memory length, influence the transient and stationary properties of the model, as well as the candidates' advantage. Our findings reveal a rich dynamical behavior: memory slows down convergence and enhances system resilience, whereas shocks of sufficient intensity and duration can abruptly realign collective preferences, particularly when occurring close to the election date. Conversely, for long memory lengths or large election horizons, shock effects are dampened or delayed, depending on their timing. These results offer insights into why some sudden political events reshape electoral outcomes while others fade under strong individual inertia. Finally, a qualitative comparison with real electoral shocks reported in opinion polls illustrates how the model captures the competition between voter inertia and abrupt external events observed in actual elections.

Authors: Eun Cheol Choi, Lindsay E. Young, Emilio Ferrara

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human judgment in computational social science, yet their ability to reproduce patterns of susceptibility to misinformation remains unclear. We test whether LLM-simulated survey respondents, prompted with participant profiles drawn from social survey data measuring network, demographic, attitudinal and behavioral features, can reproduce human patterns of misinformation belief and sharing. Using three online surveys as baselines, we evaluate whether LLM outputs match observed response distributions and recover feature-outcome associations present in the original survey data. LLM-generated responses capture broad distributional tendencies and show modest correlation with human responses, but consistently overstate the association between belief and sharing. Linear models fit to simulated responses exhibit substantially higher explained variance and place disproportionate weight on attitudinal and behavioral features, while largely ignoring personal network characteristics, relative to models fit to human responses. Analyses of model-generated reasoning and LLM training data suggest that these distortions reflect systematic biases in how misinformation-related concepts are represented. Our findings suggest that LLM-based survey simulations are better suited for diagnosing systematic divergences from human judgment than for substituting it.

Motivated by applications in cybersecurity such as finding meaningful sequences of malware-related events buried inside large amounts of computer log data, we introduce the "planted path" problem and propose an algorithm to find fuzzy matchings between two trees. This algorithm can be used as a "building block" for more complicated workflows. We demonstrate usefulness of a few of such workflows in mining synthetically generated data as well as real-world ACME cybersecurity datasets.

Authors: Florian Kramer, Henrich R. Greve, Moritz von Zahn, Hayagreeva Rao

Conspiracy theories can threaten society by spreading misinformation, deepening polarization, and eroding trust in democratic institutions. Social media often fuels the spread of conspiracies, primarily driven by two key actors: Superspreaders -- influential individuals disseminating conspiracy content at disproportionately high rates, and Bots -- automated accounts designed to amplify conspiracies strategically. To counter the spread of conspiracy theories, it is critical to both identify these actors and to better understand their behavior. However, a systematic analysis of these actors as well as real-world-applicable identification methods are still lacking. In this study, we leverage over seven million tweets from the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze key differences between Human Superspreaders and Bots across dimensions such as linguistic complexity, toxicity, and hashtag usage. Our analysis reveals distinct communication strategies: Superspreaders tend to use more complex language and substantive content while relying less on structural elements like hashtags and emojis, likely to enhance credibility and authority. By contrast, Bots favor simpler language and strategic cross-usage of hashtags, likely to increase accessibility, facilitate infiltration into trending discussions, and amplify reach. To counter both Human Superspreaders and Bots, we propose and evaluate 27 novel metrics for quantifying the severity of conspiracy theory spread. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of an adapted H-Index for computationally feasible identification of Human Superspreaders. By identifying behavioral patterns unique to Human Superspreaders and Bots as well as providing suitable identification methods, this study provides a foundation for mitigation strategies, including platform moderation policies, temporary and permanent account suspensions, and public awareness campaigns.

Authors: Sandra Fortini, Kenyon Ng, Sonia Petrone, Judith Rousseau, Susan Wei

TabPFN is a transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance on supervised tabular tasks by amortizing Bayesian prediction into a single forward pass. However, there is currently no method for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN. Because it behaves, in an idealised limit, as a Bayesian in-context learner, we cast the decomposition challenge as a Bayesian predictive inference (BPI) problem. The main computational tool in BPI, predictive Monte Carlo, is challenging to apply here as it requires simulating unmodeled covariates. We therefore pursue the asymptotic alternative, filling a gap in the theory for supervised settings by proving a predictive CLT under quasi-martingale conditions. We derive variance estimators determined by the volatility of predictive updates along the context. The resulting credible bands are fast to compute, target epistemic uncertainty, and achieve near-nominal frequentist coverage. For classification, we further obtain an entropy-based uncertainty decomposition.

Authors: Ali Mohammad-Djafari

The main contribution of this paper is to develop a hierarchical Bayesian formulation of PINNs for linear inverse problems, which is called BPINN-IP. The proposed methodology extends PINN to account for prior knowledge on the nature of the expected NN output, as well as its weights. Also, as we can have access to the posterior probability distributions, naturally uncertainties can be quantified. Also, variational inference and Monte Carlo dropout are employed to provide predictive means and variances for reconstructed images. Un example of applications to deconvolution and super-resolution is considered, details of the different steps of implementations are given, and some preliminary results are presented.

### 3. [Performative Learning Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04402v1)

Authors: Julian Rodemann, Unai Fischer-Abaigar, James Bailie, Krikamol Muandet

Performative predictions influence the very outcomes they aim to forecast. We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples. We illustrate our bounds in a case study on prediction-informed assignments of unemployed German residents to job trainings, drawing upon administrative labor market records from 1975 to 2017 in Germany.

### 4. [Conditional Counterfactual Mean Embeddings: Doubly Robust Estimation and Learning Rates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04736v1)

Authors: Thatchanon Anancharoenkij, Donlapark Ponnoprat

A complete understanding of heterogeneous treatment effects involves characterizing the full conditional distribution of potential outcomes. To this end, we propose the Conditional Counterfactual Mean Embeddings (CCME), a framework that embeds conditional distributions of counterfactual outcomes into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Under this framework, we develop a two-stage meta-estimator for CCME that accommodates any RKHS-valued regression in each stage. Based on this meta-estimator, we develop three practical CCME estimators: (1) Ridge Regression estimator, (2) Deep Feature estimator that parameterizes the feature map by a neural network, and (3) Neural-Kernel estimator that performs RKHS-valued regression, with the coefficients parameterized by a neural network. We provide finite-sample convergence rates for all estimators, establishing that they possess the double robustness property. Our experiments demonstrate that our estimators accurately recover distributional features including multimodal structure of conditional counterfactual distributions.

### 5. [Targeted Synthetic Control Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04611v1)

Authors: Yuxin Wang, Dennis Frauen, Emil Javurek, Konstantin Hess, Yuchen Ma, Stefan Feuerriegel

The synthetic control method (SCM) estimates causal effects in panel data with a single-treated unit by constructing a counterfactual outcome as a weighted combination of untreated control units that matches the pre-treatment trajectory. In this paper, we introduce the targeted synthetic control (TSC) method, a new two-stage estimator that directly estimates the counterfactual outcome. Specifically, our TSC method (1) yields a targeted debiasing estimator, in the sense that the targeted updating refines the initial weights to produce more stable weights; and (2) ensures that the final counterfactual estimation is a convex combination of observed control outcomes to enable direct interpretation of the synthetic control weights. TSC is flexible and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models. Methodologically, TSC starts from an initial set of synthetic-control weights via a one-dimensional targeted update through the weight-tilting submodel, which calibrates the weights to reduce bias of weights estimation arising from pre-treatment fit. Furthermore, TSC avoids key shortcomings of existing methods (e.g., the augmented SCM), which can produce unbounded counterfactual estimates. Across extensive synthetic and real-world experiments, TSC consistently improves estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art SCM baselines.

### 6. [Attack-Resistant Uniform Fairness for Linear and Smooth Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04125v1)

Authors: Qingwen Zhang, Wenjia Wang

Modern systems, such as digital platforms and service systems, increasingly rely on contextual bandits for online decision-making; however, their deployment can inadvertently create unfair exposure among arms, undermining long-term platform sustainability and supplier trust. This paper studies the contextual bandit problem under a uniform $(1-δ)$-fairness constraint, and addresses its unique vulnerabilities to strategic manipulation. The fairness constraint ensures that preferential treatment is strictly justified by an arm's actual reward across all contexts and time horizons, using uniformity to prevent statistical loopholes. We develop novel algorithms that achieve (nearly) minimax-optimal regret for both linear and smooth reward functions, while maintaining strong $(1-\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness guarantees, and further characterize the theoretically inherent yet asymptotically marginal "price of fairness". However, we reveal that such merit-based fairness becomes uniquely susceptible to signal manipulation. We show that an adversary with a minimal $\tilde{O}(1)$ budget can not only degrade overall performance as in traditional attacks, but also selectively induce insidious fairness-specific failures while leaving conspicuous regret measures largely unaffected. To counter this, we design robust variants incorporating corruption-adaptive exploration and error-compensated thresholding. Our approach yields the first minimax-optimal regret bounds under $C$-budgeted attack while preserving $(1-\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness. Numerical experiments and a real-world case demonstrate that our algorithms sustain both fairness and efficiency.

### 7. [Maximum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04795v1)

Authors: Olivier Vu Thanh, Nicolas Gillis

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.

### 8. [A Bandit-Based Approach to Educational Recommender Systems: Contextual Thompson Sampling for Learner Skill Gain Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04347v1)

Authors: Lukas De Kerpel, Arthur Thuy, Dries F. Benoit

In recent years, instructional practices in Operations Research (OR), Management Science (MS), and Analytics have increasingly shifted toward digital environments, where large and diverse groups of learners make it difficult to provide practice that adapts to individual needs. This paper introduces a method that generates personalized sequences of exercises by selecting, at each step, the exercise most likely to advance a learner's understanding of a targeted skill. The method uses information about the learner and their past performance to guide these choices, and learning progress is measured as the change in estimated skill level before and after each exercise. Using data from an online mathematics tutoring platform, we find that the approach recommends exercises associated with greater skill improvement and adapts effectively to differences across learners. From an instructional perspective, the framework enables personalized practice at scale, highlights exercises with consistently strong learning value, and helps instructors identify learners who may benefit from additional support.

### 9. [Provable Target Sample Complexity Improvements as Pre-Trained Models Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04233v1)

Authors: Kazuto Fukuchi, Ryuichiro Hataya, Kota Matsui

Pre-trained models have become indispensable for efficiently building models across a broad spectrum of downstream tasks. The advantages of pre-trained models have been highlighted by empirical studies on scaling laws, which demonstrate that larger pre-trained models can significantly reduce the sample complexity of downstream learning. However, existing theoretical investigations of pre-trained models lack the capability to explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a theoretical investigation by introducing a novel framework, caulking, inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as adapter-based fine-tuning, low-rank adaptation, and partial fine-tuning. Our analysis establishes that improved pre-trained models provably decrease the sample complexity of downstream tasks, thereby offering theoretical justification for the empirically observed scaling laws relating pre-trained model size to downstream performance, a relationship not covered by existing results.

### 10. [Maximin Relative Improvement: Fair Learning as a Bargaining Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04155v1)

Authors: Jiwoo Han, Moulinath Banerjee, Yuekai Sun

When deploying a single predictor across multiple subpopulations, we propose a fundamentally different approach: interpreting group fairness as a bargaining problem among subpopulations. This game-theoretic perspective reveals that existing robust optimization methods such as minimizing worst-group loss or regret correspond to classical bargaining solutions and embody different fairness principles. We propose relative improvement, the ratio of actual risk reduction to potential reduction from a baseline predictor, which recovers the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. Unlike absolute-scale methods that may not be comparable when groups have different potential predictability, relative improvement provides axiomatic justification including scale invariance and individual monotonicity. We establish finite-sample convergence guarantees under mild conditions.

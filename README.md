### 1. [MCP-SafetyBench: A Benchmark for Safety Evaluation of Large Language Models with Real-World MCP Servers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15163v1)

Authors: Xuanjun Zong, Zhiqi Shen, Lei Wang, Yunshi Lan, Chao Yang

Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into agentic systems that reason, plan, and operate external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a key enabler of this transition, offering a standardized interface for connecting LLMs with heterogeneous tools and services. Yet MCP's openness and multi-server workflows introduce new safety risks that existing benchmarks fail to capture, as they focus on isolated attacks or lack real-world coverage. We present MCP-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark built on real MCP servers that supports realistic multi-turn evaluation across five domains: browser automation, financial analysis, location navigation, repository management, and web search. It incorporates a unified taxonomy of 20 MCP attack types spanning server, host, and user sides, and includes tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and cross-server coordination under uncertainty. Using MCP-SafetyBench, we systematically evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, revealing large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow. Our results highlight the urgent need for stronger defenses and establish MCP-SafetyBench as a foundation for diagnosing and mitigating safety risks in real-world MCP deployments.

### 2. [Offline Multi-Task Multi-Objective Data-Driven Evolutionary Algorithm with Language Surrogate Model and Implicit Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15149v1)

Authors: Xian-Rong Zhang, Yue-Jiao Gong, Zeyuan Ma, Jun Zhang

Data-driven evolutionary algorithms has shown surprising results in addressing expensive optimization problems through robust surrogate modeling. Though promising, existing surrogate modeling schemes may encounter limitations in complex optimization problems with many sub-objectives, which rely on repeated and tedious approximation. To address such technical gap, we propose Q-MetaSur as a plug-and-play surrogate modeling scheme capable of providing unified and generalized surrogate learning. Specifically, we consider multi-task-multi-objective optimization~(MTMOO) in offline setting. Several key designs are proposed: 1) we transform objective approximation into sequence-to-sequence modeling where MTMOO problem can be represented by tenxual tokenization. To operate under such auto-regressive modeling, we introduce a Large Language Model-based surrogate model that first encodes a MTMOO instance and then decodes objective values of unseen decision variables. To ensure stability in training the proposed model, we propose a two-stage offline training strategy that operates as a synergy of supervised tuning and RL fine-tuning, which first exploits offline dataset to fit existing knowledge and then leverages RL to enhance model's generalization performance. Extensive empirical results on the CEC2019 benchmark demonstrate that Q-MetaSur not only outperforms representative surrogate baselines in objective approximation accuracy, but also helps underlying evolutionary algorithms achieve both desired optimization convergence and improved pareto optimality.

### 3. [I am here for you": How relational conversational AI appeals to adolescents, especially those who are socially and emotionally vulnerable](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15117v1)

Authors: Pilyoung Kim, Yun Xie, Sujin Yang

General-purpose conversational AI chatbots and AI companions increasingly provide young adolescents with emotionally supportive conversations, raising questions about how conversational style shapes anthropomorphism and emotional reliance. In a preregistered online experiment with 284 adolescent-parent dyads, youth aged 11-15 and their parents read two matched transcripts in which a chatbot responded to an everyday social problem using either a relational style (first-person, affiliative, commitment language) or a transparent style (explicit nonhumanness, informational tone). Adolescents more often preferred the relational than the transparent style, whereas parents were more likely to prefer transparent style than adolescents. Adolescents rated the relational chatbot as more human-like, likable, trustworthy and emotionally close, while perceiving both styles as similarly helpful. Adolescents who preferred relational style had lower family and peer relationship quality and higher stress and anxiety than those preferring transparent style or both chatbots. These findings identify conversational style as a key design lever for youth AI safety, showing that relational framing heightens anthropomorphism, trust and emotional closeness and can be especially appealing to socially and emotionally vulnerable adolescents, who may be at increased risk for emotional reliance on conversational AI.

### 4. [LADY: Linear Attention for Autonomous Driving Efficiency without Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15038v1)

Authors: Jihao Huang, Xi Xia, Zhiyuan Li, Tianle Liu, Jingke Wang, Junbo Chen, Tengju Ye

End-to-end paradigms have demonstrated great potential for autonomous driving. Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange. Experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time and memory complexity, offering improved planning performance and significantly reduced computational cost. Additionally, the model has been deployed and validated on edge devices, demonstrating its practicality in resource-limited scenarios.

### 5. [Beyond Proximity: A Keypoint-Trajectory Framework for Classifying Affiliative and Agonistic Social Networks in Dairy Cattle](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14998v1)

Authors: Sibi Parivendan, Kashfia Sailunaz, Suresh Neethirajan

Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

### 6. [Exploring User Acceptance and Concerns toward LLM-powered Conversational Agents in Immersive Extended Reality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15343v1)

Authors: Efe Bozkir, Enkelejda Kasneci

The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), and the availability of services that make them accessible, have led the general public to begin incorporating them into everyday life. The extended reality (XR) community has also sought to integrate LLMs, particularly in the form of conversational agents, to enhance user experience and task efficiency. When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues. To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential. Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location. We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust. Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance. In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings. We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive. Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful. We conclude with implications and recommendations for LLM-powered XR.

### 7. [Graph Contextual Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Directed Controller Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15295v1)

Authors: Toshihide Ubukata, Enhong Mu, Takuto Yamauchi, Mingyue Zhang, Jialong Li, Kenji Tei

Controller synthesis is a formal method approach for automatically generating Labeled Transition System (LTS) controllers that satisfy specified properties. The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.

### 8. [VLA-AN: An Efficient and Onboard Vision-Language-Action Framework for Aerial Navigation in Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15258v1)

Authors: Yuze Wu, Mo Zhu, Xingxing Li, Yuheng Du, Yuxin Fan, Wenjun Li, Xin Zhou, Fei Gao

This paper proposes VLA-AN, an efficient and onboard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework dedicated to autonomous drone navigation in complex environments. VLA-AN addresses four major limitations of existing large aerial navigation models: the data domain gap, insufficient temporal navigation with reasoning, safety issues with generative action policies, and onboard deployment constraints. First, we construct a high-fidelity dataset utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to effectively bridge the domain gap. Second, we introduce a progressive three-stage training framework that sequentially reinforces scene comprehension, core flight skills, and complex navigation capabilities. Third, we design a lightweight, real-time action module coupled with geometric safety correction. This module ensures fast, collision-free, and stable command generation, mitigating the safety risks inherent in stochastic generative policies. Finally, through deep optimization of the onboard deployment pipeline, VLA-AN achieves a robust real-time 8.3x improvement in inference throughput on resource-constrained UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLA-AN significantly improves spatial grounding, scene reasoning, and long-horizon navigation, achieving a maximum single-task success rate of 98.1%, and providing an efficient, practical solution for realizing full-chain closed-loop autonomy in lightweight aerial robots.

### 9. [Explaining the Reasoning of Large Language Models Using Attribution Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15663v1)

Authors: Chase Walker, Rickard Ewetz

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

### 10. [On Assessing the Relevance of Code Reviews Authored by Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15466v1)

Authors: Robert Heumüller, Frank Ortmeier

The use of large language models like ChatGPT in code review offers promising efficiency gains but also raises concerns about correctness and safety. Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of "usefulness", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers. Going further, our proposed method motivates and enables more meaningful assessments of generative AI's performance in code review, while also raising awareness of potential risks of unchecked integration into review processes.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [Implementation and Analysis of Thermometer Encoding in DWN FPGA Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15251v1)

Authors: Michael Mecik, Martin Kumm

Fully parallel neural network accelerators on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) offer high throughput for latency-critical applications but face hardware resource constraints. Weightless neural networks (WNNs) efficiently replace arithmetic with logic-based inference. Differential weightless neural networks (DWN) further optimize resource usage by learning connections between encoders and LUT layers via gradient-based training. However, DWNs rely on thermometer encoding, and the associated hardware cost has not been fully evaluated. We present a DWN hardware generator that includes thermometer encoding explicitly. Experiments on the Jet Substructure Classification (JSC) task show that encoding can increase LUT usage by up to 3.20$\times$, dominating costs in small networks and highlighting the need for encoding-aware hardware design in DWN accelerators.

### 2. [A High-level Synthesis Toolchain for the Julia Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15679v1)

Authors: Benedict Short, Ian McInerney, John Wickerson

With the push towards Exascale computing and data-driven methods, problem sizes have increased dramatically, increasing the computational requirements of the underlying algorithms. This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the "two-language problem": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications.

### 3. [FAME: FPGA Acceleration of Secure Matrix Multiplication with Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15515v1)

Authors: Zhihan Xu, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor K. Prasanna

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables secure computation on encrypted data, addressing privacy concerns in cloud computing. However, the high computational cost of HE operations, particularly matrix multiplication (MM), remains a major barrier to its practical deployment. Accelerating homomorphic encrypted MM (HE MM) is therefore crucial for applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning.
  In this paper, we present a bandwidth-efficient FPGA implementation of HE MM. We first develop a cost model to evaluate the on-chip memory requirements for a given set of HE parameters and input matrix sizes. Our analysis shows that optimizing on-chip memory usage is critical for scalable and efficient HE MM. To this end, we design a novel datapath for Homomorphic Linear Transformation (HLT), the primary bottleneck in HE MM. The proposed datapath significantly reduces off-chip memory traffic and on-chip memory demand by enabling fine-grained data reuse. Leveraging this datapath, we introduce FAME, the first FPGA-based accelerator specifically tailored for HE MM. FAME supports arbitrary matrix shapes and is configurable across a wide range of HE parameter sets. We implement FAME on an Alveo U280 FPGA and evaluate its performance across diverse matrix sizes and shapes. Experimental results show that FAME achieves an average speedup of 221x over state-of-the-art CPU-based implementations, demonstrating its scalability and practicality for large-scale consecutive HE MM and real-world workloads.

### Computational Engineering

### 1. [Update Strategy for Channel Knowledge Map in Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15154v1)

Authors: Ting Wang, Chiya Zhang, Chang Liu, Zhuoyuan Hao, Rubing Han, Weizheng Zhang, Chunlong He

The Channel Knowledge Map (CKM) maps position information to channel state information, leveraging environmental knowledge to reduce signaling overhead in sixth-generation networks. However, constructing a reliable CKM demands substantial data and computation, and in dynamic environments, a pre-built CKM becomes outdated, degrading performance. Frequent retraining restores accuracy but incurs significant waste, creating a fundamental trade-off between CKM efficacy and update overhead. To address this, we introduce a Map Efficacy Function (MEF) capturing both gradual aging and abrupt environmental transitions, and formulate the update scheduling problem as fractional programming. We develop two Dinkelbach-based algorithms: Delta-P guarantees global optimality, while Delta-L achieves near-optimal performance with near-linear complexity. For unpredictable environments, we derive a threshold-based policy: immediate updates are optimal when the environmental degradation rate exceeds the resource consumption acceleration; otherwise, delay is preferable. For predictable environments, long-term strategies strategically relax these myopic rules to maximize global performance. Across this regime, the policy reveals that stronger entry loss and faster decay favor immediate updates, while weaker entry loss and slower decay favor delayed updates.

### 2. [Bayesian Updating of constitutive parameters under hybrid uncertainties with a novel surrogate model applied to biofilms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15145v1)

Authors: Lukas Fritsch, Hendrik Geisler, Jan Grashorn, Felix Klempt, Meisam Soleimani, Matteo Broggi, Philipp Junker, Michael Beer

Accurate modeling of bacterial biofilm growth is essential for understanding their complex dynamics in biomedical, environmental, and industrial settings. These dynamics are shaped by a variety of environmental influences, including the presence of antibiotics, nutrient availability, and inter-species interactions, all of which affect species-specific growth rates. However, capturing this behavior in computational models is challenging due to the presence of hybrid uncertainties, a combination of epistemic uncertainty (stemming from incomplete knowledge about model parameters) and aleatory uncertainty (reflecting inherent biological variability and stochastic environmental conditions). In this work, we present a Bayesian model updating (BMU) framework to calibrate a recently introduced multi-species biofilm growth model. To enable efficient inference in the presence of hybrid uncertainties, we construct a reduced-order model (ROM) derived using the Time-Separated Stochastic Mechanics (TSM) approach. TSM allows for an efficient propagation of aleatory uncertainty, which enables single-loop Bayesian inference, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive nested (double-loop) schemes typically required in hybrid uncertainty quantification. The BMU framework employs a likelihood function constructed from the mean and variance of stochastic model outputs, enabling robust parameter calibration even under sparse and noisy data. We validate our approach through two case studies: a two-species and a four-species biofilm model. Both demonstrate that our method not only accurately recovers the underlying model parameters but also provides predictive responses consistent with the synthetic data.

### 3. [HD-Prot: A Protein Language Model for Joint Sequence-Structure Modeling with Continuous Structure Tokens](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15133v1)

Authors: Yi Zhou, Haohao Qu, Yunqing Liu, Shanru Lin, Le Song, Wenqi Fan

Proteins inherently possess a consistent sequence-structure duality. The abundance of protein sequence data, which can be readily represented as discrete tokens, has driven fruitful developments in protein language models (pLMs). A key remaining challenge, however, is how to effectively integrate continuous structural knowledge into pLMs. Current methods often discretize protein structures to accommodate the language modeling framework, which inevitably results in the loss of fine-grained information and limits the performance potential of multimodal pLMs. In this paper, we argue that such concerns can be circumvented: a sequence-based pLM can be extended to incorporate the structure modality through continuous tokens, i.e., high-fidelity protein structure latents that avoid vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a hybrid diffusion protein language model, HD-Prot, which embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM, enabling seamless operation with both discrete and continuous tokens for joint sequence-structure modeling. It captures inter-token dependencies across modalities through a unified absorbing diffusion process, and estimates per-token distributions via categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. Extensive empirical results show that HD-Prot achieves competitive performance in unconditional sequence-structure co-generation, motif-scaffolding, protein structure prediction, and inverse folding tasks, performing on par with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs despite being developed under limited computational resources. It highlights the viability of simultaneously estimating categorical and continuous distributions within a unified language model architecture, offering a promising alternative direction for multimodal pLMs.

### 4. [Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Financial Portfolio Management](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14992v1)

Authors: E. C. Garrido-Merchán, S. Mora-Figueroa, M. Coronado-Vaca

DRL agents circumvent the issue of classic models in the sense that they do not make assumptions like the financial returns being normally distributed and are able to deal with any information like the ESG score if they are configured to gain a reward that makes an objective better. However, the performance of DRL agents has high variability and it is very sensible to the value of their hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization is a class of methods that are suited to the optimization of black-box functions, that is, functions whose analytical expression is unknown, are noisy and expensive to evaluate. The hyperparameter tuning problem of DRL algorithms perfectly suits this scenario. As training an agent just for one objective is a very expensive period, requiring millions of timesteps, instead of optimizing an objective being a mixture of a risk-performance metric and an ESG metric, we choose to separate the objective and solve the multi-objective scenario to obtain an optimal Pareto set of portfolios representing the best tradeoff between the Sharpe ratio and the ESG mean score of the portfolio and leaving to the investor the choice of the final portfolio. We conducted our experiments using environments encoded within the OpenAI Gym, adapted from the FinRL platform. The experiments are carried out in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the NASDAQ markets in terms of the Sharpe ratio achieved by the agent and the mean ESG score of the portfolio. We compare the performance of the obtained Pareto sets in hypervolume terms illustrating how portfolios are the best trade-off between the Sharpe ratio and mean ESG score. Also, we show the usefulness of our proposed methodology by comparing the obtained hypervolume with one achieved by a Random Search methodology on the DRL hyperparameter space.

### 5. [Nonparametric Stochastic Subspaces via the Bootstrap for Characterizing Model Error](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15624v1)

Authors: Akash Yadav, Ruda Zhang

Reliable forward uncertainty quantification in engineering requires methods that account for aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.

### 6. [Neural Modular Physics for Elastic Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15083v1)

Authors: Yifei Li, Haixu Wu, Zeyi Xu, Tuur Stuyck, Wojciech Matusik

Learning-based methods have made significant progress in physics simulation, typically approximating dynamics with a monolithic end-to-end optimized neural network. Although these models offer an effective way to simulation, they may lose essential features compared to traditional numerical simulators, such as physical interpretability and reliability. Drawing inspiration from classical simulators that operate in a modular fashion, this paper presents Neural Modular Physics (NMP) for elastic simulation, which combines the approximation capacity of neural networks with the physical reliability of traditional simulators. Beyond the previous monolithic learning paradigm, NMP enables direct supervision of intermediate quantities and physical constraints by decomposing elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected through intermediate physical quantities. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, our method transforms the numerical computation flow into a modular neural simulator, achieving improved physical consistency and generalizability. Experimentally, NMP demonstrates superior generalization to unseen initial conditions and resolutions, stable long-horizon simulation, better preservation of physical properties compared to other neural simulators, and greater feasibility in scenarios with unknown underlying dynamics than traditional simulators.

### 7. [A Data-Enhanced Agent-Based Model for Simulating 3D Cancer Spheroid Growth: Integrating Metabolism and Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15361v1)

Authors: Pedro Garcia-Gomez, Paula Guerrero-Lopez, Silvia Hervas-Raluy, Jose Manuel Garcia-Aznar

Cancer research has shifted from a purely gene-centric view to a more holistic understanding that recognizes the critical role of the tumour microenvironment, where mechanics and metabolism are key drivers of disease progression. However, the intricate interplay between these multifactorial mechanisms remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present an agent-based computational model (ABM) that integrates tumour metabolism and mechanics to study 3D cancer spheroid growth. Our approach unifies the metabolism and mechanical aspects of tumour development within an integral model for cancer spheroid formation and growth. In addition to that, we performed a computational calibration of the parameters and tested the model versatility to reproduce different cellular behaviours. Our model reproduced qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental results of spheroid growth obtained in the lab and also allowed to discern different dynamics that cancer cells can present under the same conditions, providing insight into the potential factors contributing to the variability in the size of spheroids. Furthermore, it also showed its adaptability to reproduce diferent cell lines and behaviours by tuning its parameters. This study highlights the significant potential and versatility of integrative modelling approaches in the field of cancer research, not only as a tool to complement in vitro studies, but also as independent tools to derive conclusions from the physical reality.

### 1. [Evaluating LLMs for Zeolite Synthesis Event Extraction (ZSEE): A Systematic Analysis of Prompting Strategies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15312v1)

Authors: Charan Prakash Rathore, Saumi Ray, Dhruv Kumar

Extracting structured information from zeolite synthesis experimental procedures is critical for materials discovery, yet existing methods have not systematically evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) for this domain-specific task. This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs achieve high-level understanding, precise extraction of experimental parameters requires domain-adapted models, providing quantitative benchmarks for scientific information extraction.

### 2. [The Moralization Corpus: Frame-Based Annotation and Analysis of Moralizing Speech Acts across Diverse Text Genres](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15248v1)

Authors: Maria Becker, Mirko Sommer, Lars Tapken, Yi Wan Teh, Bruno Brocai

Moralizations - arguments that invoke moral values to justify demands or positions - are a yet underexplored form of persuasive communication. We present the Moralization Corpus, a novel multi-genre dataset designed to analyze how moral values are strategically used in argumentative discourse. Moralizations are pragmatically complex and often implicit, posing significant challenges for both human annotators and NLP systems. We develop a frame-based annotation scheme that captures the constitutive elements of moralizations - moral values, demands, and discourse protagonists - and apply it to a diverse set of German texts, including political debates, news articles, and online discussions. The corpus enables fine-grained analysis of moralizing language across communicative formats and domains. We further evaluate several large language models (LLMs) under varied prompting conditions for the task of moralization detection and moralization component extraction and compare it to human annotations in order to investigate the challenges of automatic and manual analysis of moralizations. Results show that detailed prompt instructions has a greater effect than few-shot or explanation-based prompting, and that moralization remains a highly subjective and context-sensitive task. We release all data, annotation guidelines, and code to foster future interdisciplinary research on moral discourse and moral reasoning in NLP.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a key enabler of this transition, offering a standardized interface for connecting LLMs with heterogeneous tools and services. Yet MCP's openness and multi-server workflows introduce new safety risks that existing benchmarks fail to capture, as they focus on isolated attacks or lack real-world coverage.

Using MCP-SafetyBench, we systematically evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, revealing large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow. Our results highlight the urgent need for stronger defenses and establish MCP-SafetyBench as a foundation for diagnosing and mitigating safety risks in real-world MCP deployments.

This paper presents a large-scale corpus of Rakuten Travel Reviews. Our collection contains 7.3 million customer reviews for 16 years, ranging from 2009 to 2024. Each record in the dataset contains the review text, its response from an accommodation, an anonymized reviewer ID, review date, accommodation ID, plan ID, plan title, room type, room name, purpose, accompanying group, and user ratings from different aspect categories, as well as an overall score. We present statistical information about our corpus and provide insights into factors driving data drift between 2019 and 2024 using statistical approaches.

### 5. [DASH: Dialogue-Aware Similarity and Handshake Recognition for Topic Segmentation in Public-Channel Conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15042v1)

Authors: Sijin Sun, Liangbin Zhao, Ming Deng, Xiuju Fu

Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) is crucial for understanding task-oriented public-channel communications, such as maritime VHF dialogues, which feature informal speech and implicit transitions. To address the limitations of traditional methods, we propose DASH-DTS, a novel LLM-based framework. Its core contributions are: (1) topic shift detection via dialogue handshake recognition; (2) contextual enhancement through similarity-guided example selection; and (3) the generation of selective positive and negative samples to improve model discrimination and robustness. Additionally, we release VHF-Dial, the first public dataset of real-world maritime VHF communications, to advance research in this domain. DASH-DTS provides interpretable reasoning and confidence scores for each segment. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves several sota segmentation trusted accuracy on both VHF-Dial and standard benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for stable monitoring and decision support in operational dialogues.

### 6. [Towards Proactive Personalization through Profile Customization for Individual Users in Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15302v1)

Authors: Xiaotian Zhang, Yuan Wang, Ruizhe Chen, Zeya Wang, Runchen Hou, Zuozhu Liu

The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive systems necessitates a deep alignment with the nuanced and dynamic preferences of individual users. Current alignment techniques predominantly address universal human values or static, single-turn preferences, thereby failing to address the critical needs of long-term personalization and the initial user cold-start problem. To bridge this gap, we propose PersonalAgent, a novel user-centric lifelong agent designed to continuously infer and adapt to user preferences. PersonalAgent constructs and dynamically refines a unified user profile by decomposing dialogues into single-turn interactions, framing preference inference as a sequential decision-making task. Experiments show that PersonalAgent achieves superior performance over strong prompt-based and policy optimization baselines, not only in idealized but also in noisy conversational contexts, while preserving cross-session preference consistency. Furthermore, human evaluation confirms that PersonalAgent excels at capturing user preferences naturally and coherently. Our findings underscore the importance of lifelong personalization for developing more inclusive and adaptive conversational agents. Our code is available here.

### 7. [Explaining the Reasoning of Large Language Models Using Attribution Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15663v1)

Authors: Chase Walker, Rickard Ewetz

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

### 8. [An Empirical Study on Chinese Character Decomposition in Multiword Expression-Aware Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15556v1)

Authors: Lifeng Han, Gareth J. F. Jones, Alan F. Smeaton

Word meaning, representation, and interpretation play fundamental roles in natural language understanding (NLU), natural language processing (NLP), and natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT). Furthermore, we report experiments to examine how Chinese character decomposition technology contributes to the representation of the original meanings of Chinese words and characters, and how it can effectively address the challenges of translating MWEs.

Authors: Ayman Eddakrouri, Amani Ramadan

This study applies Brookes' Measure of Categorical Dispersion (Δ) to analyze the thematic structure of contemporary Arabic Applied Linguistics research. Using a comprehensive, real-world dataset of 1,564 publications from 2019 to 2025, classified into eight core sub-disciplines, we calculate a dispersion index of Δ = 0.194. This remarkably low value indicates extreme thematic dispersion, revealing that the field is characterized by pronounced heterogeneity rather than concentration. The analysis identifies Computational Linguistics as a dominant but non-hegemonic force, coexisting with robust research in Sociolinguistics, Language Teaching, and other subfields. This study clarifies the correct application of Brookes' original formula, demonstrates its utility for field characterization, and provides a replicable bibliometric methodology for assessing disciplinary structure across domains.

### 10. [ChatGPT and Gemini participated in the Korean College Scholastic Ability Test -- Earth Science I](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15298v1)

Authors: Seok-Hyun Ga, Chun-Yen Chang

The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

### 1. [Packed Malware Detection Using Grayscale Binary-to-Image Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15414v1)

Authors: Ehab Alkhateeb, Ali Ghorbani, Arash Habibi Lashkari

Detecting packed executables is a critical step in malware analysis, as packing obscures the original code and complicates static inspection. This study evaluates both classical feature-based methods and deep learning approaches that transform binary executables into visual representations, specifically, grayscale byte plots, and employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated classification of packed and non-packed binaries. A diverse dataset of benign and malicious Portable Executable (PE) files, packed using various commercial and open-source packers, was curated to capture a broad spectrum of packing transformations and obfuscation techniques. Classical models using handcrafted Gabor jet features achieved intense discrimination at moderate computational cost. In contrast, CNNs based on VGG16 and DenseNet121 significantly outperformed them, achieving high detection performance with well-balanced precision, recall, and F1-scores. DenseNet121 demonstrated slightly higher precision and lower false positive rates, whereas VGG16 achieved marginally higher recall, indicating complementary strengths for practical deployment. Evaluation against unknown packers confirmed robust generalization, demonstrating that grayscale byte-plot representations combined with deep learning provide a useful and reliable approach for early detection of packed malware, enhancing malware analysis pipelines and supporting automated antivirus inspection.

### 2. [Talking to the Airgap: Exploiting Radio-Less Embedded Devices as Radio Receivers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15387v1)

Authors: Paul Staat, Daniel Davidovich, Christof Paar

Intelligent electronics are deeply embedded in critical infrastructures and must remain reliable, particularly against deliberate attacks. To minimize risks and impede remote compromise, sensitive systems can be physically isolated from external networks, forming an airgap. Yet, airgaps can still be infiltrated by capable adversaries gaining code execution. Prior research has shown that attackers can then attempt to wirelessly exfiltrate data across the airgap by exploiting unintended radio emissions. In this work, we demonstrate reversal of this link: malicious code execution on embedded devices can enable wireless infiltration of airgapped systems without any hardware modification. In contrast to previous infiltration methods that depend on dedicated sensors (e.g., microphones, LEDs, or temperature sensors) or require strict line-of-sight, we show that unmodified, sensor-less embedded devices can inadvertently act as radio receivers. This phenomenon stems from parasitic RF sensitivity in PCB traces and on-chip analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), allowing external transmissions to be received and decoded entirely in software.
  Across twelve commercially available embedded devices and two custom prototypes, we observe repeatable reception in the 300-1000 MHz range, with detectable signal power as low as 1 mW. To this end, we propose a systematic methodology to identify device configurations that foster such radio sensitivities and comprehensively evaluate their feasibility for wireless data reception. Exploiting these sensitivities, we demonstrate successful data reception over tens of meters, even in non-line-of-sight conditions and show that the reception sensitivities accommodate data rates of up to 100 kbps. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored command-and-control vector for air-gapped systems while challenging assumptions about their inherent isolation. [shortened]

### 3. [Practical Challenges in Executing Shor's Algorithm on Existing Quantum Platforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15330v1)

Authors: Paul Bagourd, Julian Jang-Jaccard, Vincent Lenders, Alain Mermoud, Torsten Hoefler, Cornelius Hempel

Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.

### 4. [Remotely Detectable Robot Policy Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15379v1)

Authors: Michael Amir, Manon Flageat, Amanda Prorok

The success of machine learning for real-world robotic systems has created a new form of intellectual property: the trained policy. This raises a critical need for novel methods that verify ownership and detect unauthorized, possibly unsafe misuse. While watermarking is established in other domains, physical policies present a unique challenge: remote detection. Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity. To show it does not degrade performance, we prove CoNoCo preserves the marginal action distribution. Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments. This work provides a necessary step toward protecting intellectual property in robotics, offering the first method for validating the provenance of physical policies non-invasively, using purely remote observations.

### 5. [Insecure Ingredients? Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15447v1)

Authors: Ben Swierzy, Marc Ohm, Michael Meier

Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.

Authors: Mengying Wu, Pei Chen, Geng Hong, Aichao An, Jinsong Chen, Binwang Wan, Xudong Pan, Jiarun Dai, Min Yang

Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables agents to interact with external tools, yet empirical research on MCP is hindered by the lack of large-scale, accessible datasets. We present MCPZoo, the largest and most comprehensive dataset of MCP servers collected from multiple public sources, comprising 90,146 servers. MCPZoo includes over ten thousand server instances that have been deployed and verified as runnable and interactable, supporting realistic experimentation beyond static analysis. The dataset provides unified metadata and access interfaces, enabling systematic exploration and interaction without manual deployment effort. MCPZoo is released as an open and accessible resource to support research on MCP-based security analysis.

Authors: Zhenhao Yin, Hanbing Yan, Huishu Lu, Jing Xiong, Xiangyu Li, Rui Mei, Tianning Zang

Large-scale, standardized datasets for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) research are scarce, and inconsistent actor aliases and redundant samples hinder reproducibility. This paper presents APT-ClaritySet and its construction pipeline that normalizes threat actor aliases (reconciling approximately 11.22\% of inconsistent names) and applies graph-feature deduplication -- reducing the subset of statically analyzable executables by 47.55\% while retaining behaviorally distinct variants. APT-ClaritySet comprises: (i) APT-ClaritySet-Full, the complete pre-deduplication collection with 34{,}363 malware samples attributed to 305 APT groups (2006 - early 2025); (ii) APT-ClaritySet-Unique, the deduplicated release with 25{,}923 unique samples spanning 303 groups and standardized attributions; and (iii) APT-ClaritySet-FuncReuse, a function-level resource that includes 324{,}538 function-reuse clusters (FRCs) enabling measurement of inter-/intra-group sharing, evolution, and tooling lineage. By releasing these components and detailing the alias normalization and scalable deduplication pipeline, this work provides a high-fidelity, reproducible foundation for quantitative studies of APT patterns, evolution, and attribution.

### 8. [ScamSweeper: Detecting Illegal Accounts in Web3 Scams via Transactions Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15030v1)

Authors: Xiaoqi Li, Wenkai Li, Zhijie Liu, Meikang Qiu, Zhiquan Liu, Sen Nie, Zongwei Li, Shi Wu, Yuqing Zhang

The web3 applications have recently been growing, especially on the Ethereum platform, starting to become the target of scammers. The web3 scams, imitating the services provided by legitimate platforms, mimic regular activity to deceive users. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on de-anonymization and phishing nodes, neglecting the distinctive features of web3 scams. Moreover, the current phishing account detection tools utilize graph learning or sampling algorithms to obtain graph features. However, large-scale transaction networks with temporal attributes conform to a power-law distribution, posing challenges in detecting web3 scams. To overcome these challenges, we present ScamSweeper, a novel framework that emphasizes the dynamic evolution of transaction graphs, to identify web3 scams on Ethereum. ScamSweeper samples the network with a structure temporal random walk, which is an optimized sample walking method that considers both temporal attributes and structural information. Then, the directed graph encoder generates the features of each subgraph during different temporal intervals, sorting as a sequence. Moreover, a variational Transformer is utilized to extract the dynamic evolution in the subgraph sequence. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale transaction dataset consisting of web3 scams, phishing, and normal accounts, which are from the first 18 million block heights on Ethereum. Subsequently, we comprehensively analyze the distinctions in various attributes, including nodes, edges, and degree distribution. Our experiments indicate that ScamSweeper outperforms SIEGE, Ethident, and PDTGA in detecting web3 scams, achieving a weighted F1-score improvement of at least 17.29% with the base value of 0.59. In addition, ScamSweeper in phishing node detection achieves at least a 17.5% improvement over DGTSG and BERT4ETH in F1-score from 0.80.

### 9. [SeBERTis: A Framework for Producing Classifiers of Security-Related Issue Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15003v1)

Authors: Sogol Masoumzadeh, Yufei Li, Shane McIntosh, Dániel Varró, Lili Wei

Monitoring issue tracker submissions is a crucial software maintenance activity. A key goal is the prioritization of high risk, security-related bugs. If such bugs can be recognized early, the risk of propagation to dependent products and endangerment of stakeholder benefits can be mitigated. To assist triage engineers with this task, several automatic detection techniques, from Machine Learning (ML) models to prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), have been proposed. Although promising to some extent, prior techniques often memorize lexical cues as decision shortcuts, yielding low detection rate specifically for more complex submissions. As such, these classifiers do not yet reach the practical expectations of a real-time detector of security-related issues. To address these limitations, we propose SEBERTIS, a framework to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as classifiers independent of lexical cues, so that they can confidently detect fully unseen security-related issues. SEBERTIS capitalizes on fine-tuning bidirectional transformer architectures as Masked Language Models (MLMs) on a series of semantically equivalent vocabulary to prediction labels (which we call Semantic Surrogates) when they have been replaced with a mask. Our SEBERTIS-trained classifier achieves a 0.9880 F1-score in detecting security-related issues of a curated corpus of 10,000 GitHub issue reports, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art issue classifiers, with 14.44%-96.98%, 15.40%-93.07%, and 14.90%-94.72% higher detection precision, recall, and F1-score over ML-based baselines. Our classifier also substantially surpasses LLM baselines, with an improvement of 23.20%-63.71%, 36.68%-85.63%, and 39.49%-74.53% for precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 10. [Bits for Privacy: Evaluating Post-Training Quantization via Membership Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15335v1)

Authors: Chenxiang Zhang, Tongxi Qu, Zhong Li, Tian Zhang, Jun Pang, Sjouke Mauw

Deep neural networks are widely deployed with quantization techniques to reduce memory and computational costs by lowering the numerical precision of their parameters. While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms-AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC-across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off. These results offer actionable insights for practitioners to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection in real-world deployments.

Authors: Yunseong Nam, Jiwon Jang, Dongkyu Won, Sang Hyun Park, Soopil Kim

Preference optimization offers a scalable supervision paradigm based on relative preference signals, yet prior attempts in medical image segmentation remain model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling. In this paper, we propose MAPO (Model-Agnostic Preference Optimization), a training framework that utilizes Dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision. MAPO is fully architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic, supporting 2D/3D CNN and Transformer-based segmentation pipelines. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse medical datasets reveal that MAPO consistently enhances boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and yields more stable optimization dynamics compared to conventional supervised training.

### 2. [Beyond Proximity: A Keypoint-Trajectory Framework for Classifying Affiliative and Agonistic Social Networks in Dairy Cattle](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14998v1)

Authors: Sibi Parivendan, Kashfia Sailunaz, Suresh Neethirajan

Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

### 3. [ST-DETrack: Identity-Preserving Branch Tracking in Entangled Plant Canopies via Dual Spatiotemporal Evidence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15445v1)

Authors: Yueqianji Chen, Kevin Williams, John H. Doonan, Paolo Remagnino, Jo Hepworth

Automated extraction of individual plant branches from time-series imagery is essential for high-throughput phenotyping, yet it remains computationally challenging due to non-rigid growth dynamics and severe identity fragmentation within entangled canopies. To overcome these stage-dependent ambiguities, we propose ST-DETrack, a spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network designed to preserve branch identity from budding to flowering. Our architecture integrates a spatial decoder, which leverages geometric priors such as position and angle for early-stage tracking, with a temporal decoder that exploits motion consistency to resolve late-stage occlusions. Crucially, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically shifts reliance between these spatial and temporal cues, while a biological constraint based on negative gravitropism mitigates vertical growth ambiguities. Validated on a Brassica napus dataset, ST-DETrack achieves a Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) of 93.6%, significantly outperforming spatial and temporal baselines by 28.9 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate the method's robustness in maintaining long-term identity consistency amidst complex, dynamic plant architectures.

### 4. [CLIP-FTI: Fine-Grained Face Template Inversion via CLIP-Driven Attribute Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15433v1)

Authors: Longchen Dai, Zixuan Shen, Zhiheng Zhou, Peipeng Yu, Zhihua Xia

Face recognition systems store face templates for efficient matching. Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.

Authors: Simon Gutwein, Arthur Longuefosse, Jun Seita, Sabine Taschner-Mandl, Roxane Licandro

Multiplexed tissue imaging measures dozens of protein markers per cell, yet most deep learning models still apply early channel fusion, assuming shared structure across markers. We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning. Code is available at https://github.com/SimonBon/CIM-S.

Authors: Fei Zhao, Mengxi Guo, Shijie Zhao, Junlin Li, Li Zhang, Xiaodong Xie

There has been a growing trend in compressing and transmitting videos from terminals for machine vision tasks. Nevertheless, most video coding optimization method focus on minimizing distortion according to human perceptual metrics, overlooking the heightened demands posed by machine vision systems. In this paper, we propose a video preprocessing framework tailored for machine vision tasks to address this challenge. The proposed method incorporates a neural preprocessor which retaining crucial information for subsequent tasks, resulting in the boosting of rate-accuracy performance. We further introduce a differentiable virtual codec to provide constraints on rate and distortion during the training stage. We directly apply widely used standard codecs for testing. Therefore, our solution can be easily applied to real-world scenarios. We conducted extensive experiments evaluating our compression method on two typical downstream tasks with various backbone networks. The experimental results indicate that our approach can save over 15% of bitrate compared to using only the standard codec anchor version.

Authors: Yu Wang, Juhyung Ha, Frangil M. Ramirez, Yuchen Wang, David J. Crandall

Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is currently speaking in each frame of a video. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker. Out-of-domain experiments demonstrate the generalization of our model, while comprehensive ablations show the complementary benefits of each component.

Authors: Yifei Li, Wenzhao Zheng, Yanran Zhang, Runze Sun, Yu Zheng, Lei Chen, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu

The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.

Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.

The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Our code is available at the following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRAN-TED-4FCC/.

### 1. [Measuring Nonlinear Relationships and Spatial Heterogeneity of Influencing Factors on Traffic Crash Density Using GeoXAI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14985v1)

Authors: Jiaqing Lu, Ziqi Li, Lei Han, Qianwen Guo

This study applies a Geospatial Explainable AI (GeoXAI) framework to analyze the spatially heterogeneous and nonlinear determinants of traffic crash density in Florida. By combining a high-performing machine learning model with GeoShapley, the framework provides interpretable, tract-level insights into how roadway characteristics and socioeconomic factors contribute to crash risk. Specifically, results show that variables such as road density, intersection density, neighborhood compactness, and educational attainment exhibit complex nonlinear relationships with crashes. Extremely dense urban areas, such as Miami, show sharply elevated crash risk due to intensified pedestrian activities and roadway complexity. The GeoShapley approach also captures strong spatial heterogeneity in the influence of these factors. Major metropolitan areas including Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville display significantly higher intrinsic crash contributions, while rural tracts generally have lower baseline risk. Each factor exhibits pronounced spatial variation across the state. Based on these findings, the study proposes targeted, geography-sensitive policy recommendations, including traffic calming in compact neighborhoods, adaptive intersection design, speed management on high-volume corridors such as I-95 in Miami, and equity-focused safety interventions in disadvantaged rural areas of central and northern Florida. Moreover, this paper compares the results obtained from GeoShapley framework against other established methods (e.g., SHAP and MGWR), demonstrating its powerful ability to explain nonlinearity and spatial heterogeneity simultaneously.

### 2. [Exploring User Acceptance and Concerns toward LLM-powered Conversational Agents in Immersive Extended Reality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15343v1)

Authors: Efe Bozkir, Enkelejda Kasneci

The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), and the availability of services that make them accessible, have led the general public to begin incorporating them into everyday life. The extended reality (XR) community has also sought to integrate LLMs, particularly in the form of conversational agents, to enhance user experience and task efficiency. When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues. To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential. Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location. We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust. Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance. In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings. We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive. Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful. We conclude with implications and recommendations for LLM-powered XR.

Authors: Sam Hind

Innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) has always been dependent on technological infrastructures, from code repositories to computing hardware. Yet industry -- rather than universities -- has become increasingly influential in shaping AI innovation. As generative forms of AI powered by large language models (LLMs) have driven the breakout of AI into the wider world, the AI community has sought to develop new methods for independently evaluating the performance of AI models. How best, in other words, to compare the performance of AI models against other AI models -- and how best to account for new models launched on nearly a daily basis? Building on recent work in media studies, STS, and computer science on benchmarking and the practices of AI evaluation, I examine the rise of so-called 'arenas' in which AI models are evaluated with reference to gladiatorial-style 'battles'. Through a technography of a leading user-driven AI model evaluation platform, LMArena, I consider five themes central to the emerging 'arena-ization' of AI innovation. Accordingly, I argue that the arena-ization is being powered by a 'viral' desire to capture attention both in, and outside of, the AI community, critical to the scaling and commercialization of AI products. In the discussion, I reflect on the implications of 'arena gaming', a phenomenon through which model developers hope to capture attention.

Authors: Seok-Hyun Ga, Chun-Yen Chang

The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

### 5. [Toxicity Ahead: Forecasting Conversational Derailment on GitHub](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15031v1)

Authors: Mia Mohammad Imran, Robert Zita, Rahat Rizvi Rahman, Preetha Chatterjee, Kostadin Damevski

Toxic interactions in Open Source Software (OSS) communities reduce contributor engagement and threaten project sustainability. Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.
  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of structured LLM prompting for early detection of conversational derailment in OSS, enabling proactive and explainable moderation.

Authors: Md. Samiul Alim, Mahir Shahriar Tamim, Maisha Rahman, Tanvir Ahmed Khan, Md Mushfique Anwar

Sentiment analysis, an emerging research area within natural language processing (NLP), has primarily been explored in contexts like elections and social media trends, but there remains a significant gap in understanding emotional dynamics during civil unrest, particularly in the Bangla language. Our study pioneers sentiment analysis in Bangla during a national crisis by examining public emotions amid Bangladesh's 2024 mass uprising. We curated a unique dataset of 2,028 annotated news headlines from major Facebook news portals, classifying them into Outrage, Hope, and Despair. Through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified prevalent themes like political corruption and public protests, and analyzed how events such as internet blackouts shaped sentiment patterns. It outperformed multilingual transformers (mBERT: 67%, XLM-RoBERTa: 71%) and traditional machine learning methods (SVM and Logistic Regression: both 70%). These results highlight the effectiveness of language-specific models and offer valuable insights into public sentiment during political turmoil.

Authors: Atte Ojanen, Johannes Anttila, Thilo H. K. Thelitz, Anna Bjork

The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) present unique challenges for policymakers that seek to govern the technology. In this context, the Delphi method has become an established way to identify consensus and disagreement on emerging technological issues among experts in the field of futures studies and foresight. The aim of this article is twofold: first, it examines key tensions experts see in the development of AI governance in Europe, and second, it reflects on the Delphi method's capacity to inform anticipatory governance of emerging technologies like AI based on these insights. The analysis is based on the results of a two-round Policy Delphi study on the future of AI governance with European policymakers, researchers and NGOs, conducted in mid-2024. The Policy Delphi proved useful in revealing diverse perspectives on European AI governance, drawing out a consensus that future-proof AI regulation will likely depend more on practical implementation and enforcement of legislation than on its technical specifics or scope. Furthermore, the study identified a desirability-probability gap in AI governance: desirable policy directions, like greater citizen participation, were perceived as less probable and feasible. This highlights a tension between desirable regulatory oversight and the practical difficulty for regulation to keep up with technological change.

Authors: Damian Hodel, Jevin D. West

The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns of knowledge collapse, i.e., a reduction to the most dominant and central set of ideas. Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models.

Authors: Gajendra Doniparthi, Shashank Balu Pandhare, Stefan Deßloch, Timo Mühlhaus

Traditional search applications within Research Data Management (RDM) ecosystems are crucial in helping users discover and explore the structured metadata from the research datasets. Typically, text search engines require users to submit keyword-based queries rather than using natural language. However, using Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on domain-specific content for specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks is becoming increasingly common. We present ArcBERT, an LLM-based system designed for integrated metadata exploration. ArcBERT understands natural language queries and relies on semantic matching, unlike traditional search applications. Notably, ArcBERT also understands the structure and hierarchies within the metadata, enabling it to handle diverse user querying patterns effectively.

### 2. [Graph Pattern-based Association Rules Evaluated Under No-repeated-anything Semantics in the Graph Transactional Setting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15308v1)

Authors: Basil Ell

We introduce graph pattern-based association rules (GPARs) for directed labeled multigraphs such as RDF graphs. GPARs support both generative tasks, where a graph is extended, and evaluative tasks, where the plausibility of a graph is assessed. The framework goes beyond related formalisms such as graph functional dependencies, graph entity dependencies, relational association rules, graph association rules, multi-relation and path association rules, and Horn rules. Given a collection of graphs, we evaluate graph patterns under no-repeated-anything semantics, which allows the topology of a graph to be taken into account more effectively. We define a probability space and derive confidence, lift, leverage, and conviction in a probabilistic setting. We further analyze how these metrics relate to their classical itemset-based counterparts and identify conditions under which their characteristic properties are preserved.

Authors: Cristina Aguiar, Jacques Chabin, Alexandre Chanson, Mirian Halfeld-Ferrari, Nicolas Hiot, Nicolas Labroche, Patrick Marcel, Verónika Peralta, Felipe Vasconcelos

While scoring nodes in graphs to understand their importance (e.g., in terms of centrality) has been investigated for decades, comparing nodes in property graphs based on their properties has not, to our knowledge, yet been addressed. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically extract comparison of nodes in property graphs, to support the interactive exploratory analysis of said graphs. We first present a way of devising comparison indicators using the context of nodes to be compared. Then, we formally define the problem of using these indicators to group the nodes so that the comparisons extracted are both significant and not straightforward. We propose various heuristics for solving this problem. Our tests on real property graph databases show that simple heuristics can be used to obtain insights within minutes while slower heuristics are needed to obtain insights of higher quality.

Authors: Zixin Wei, Yucan Guo, Jinyang Li, Xiaolin Han, Xiaolong Jin, Chenhao Ma

The search for suitable datasets is the critical "first step" in data-driven research, but it remains a great challenge. Researchers often need to search for datasets based on high-level task descriptions. However, existing search systems struggle with this task due to ambiguous user intent, task-to-dataset mapping and benchmark gaps, and entity ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce KATS, a novel end-to-end system for task-oriented dataset search from unstructured scientific literature. KATS consists of two key components, i.e., offline knowledge base construction and online query processing. The sophisticated offline pipeline automatically constructs a high-quality, dynamically updatable task-dataset knowledge graph by employing a collaborative multi-agent framework for information extraction, thereby filling the task-to-dataset mapping gap. To further address the challenge of entity ambiguity, a unique semantic-based mechanism is used for task entity linking and dataset entity resolution. For online retrieval, KATS utilizes a specialized hybrid query engine that combines vector search with graph-based ranking to generate highly relevant results. Additionally, we introduce CS-TDS, a tailored benchmark suite for evaluating task-oriented dataset search systems, addressing the critical gap in standardized evaluation. Experiments on our benchmark suite show that KATS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented generation frameworks in both effectiveness and efficiency, providing a robust blueprint for the next generation of dataset discovery systems.

Authors: Chin Fang, Timothy Stitt, Michael J. McManus, Toshio Moriya

The pursuit of high-performance data transfer often focuses on raw network bandwidth, and international links of 100 Gbps or higher are frequently considered the primary enabler. While necessary, this network-centric view is incomplete, equating provisioned link speeds with practical, sustainable data movement capabilities across the entire edge-to-core spectrum. This paper investigates six common paradigms, from the often-cited constraints of network latency and TCP congestion control algorithms to host-side factors such as CPU performance and virtualization that critically impact data movement workflows. We validated our findings using a latency-emulation-capable testbed for high-speed WAN performance prediction and through extensive production measurements from resource-constrained edge environments to a 100 Gbps operational link connecting Switzerland and California, U.S. These results show that the principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design ensures consistent performance, whether moving data at 1 Gbps or 100 Gbps and faster. This approach effectively closes the fidelity gap between benchmark results and diverse and complex production environments.

### 2. [LLMQ: Efficient Lower-Precision Pretraining for Consumer GPUs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15306v1)

Authors: Erik Schultheis, Dan Alistarh

We present LLMQ, an end-to-end CUDA/C++ implementation for medium-sized language-model training, e.g. 3B to 32B parameters, on affordable, commodity GPUs. These devices are characterized by low memory availability and slow communication compared to datacentre-grade GPUs. Consequently, we showcase a range of optimizations that target these bottlenecks, including activation checkpointing, offloading, and copy-engine based collectives. LLMQ is able to train or fine-tune a 7B model on a single 16GB mid-range gaming card, or a 32B model on a workstation equipped with 4 RTX 4090s. This is achieved while executing a standard 8-bit training pipeline, without additional algorithmic approximations, and maintaining FLOP utilization of around 50%. The efficiency of LLMQ rivals that of production-scale systems on much more expensive cloud-grade GPUs.

### 3. [Dynamic Rebatching for Efficient Early-Exit Inference with DREX](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15705v1)

Authors: Xuting Liu, Daniel Alexander, Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla, Behnaz Arzani, Vincent Liu

Early-Exit (EE) is a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that accelerates inference by allowing easier tokens to be generated using only a subset of the model's layers. However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying. Our evaluation shows that DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining output quality. Crucially, DREX completely eliminates involuntary exits, providing a key guarantee for preserving the output quality intended by the EE model.

### 4. [LeaseGuard: Raft Leases Done Right](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15659v1)

Authors: A. Jesse Jiryu Davis, Murat Demirbas, Lingzhi Deng

Raft is a leading consensus algorithm for replicating writes in distributed databases. However, distributed databases also require consistent reads. To guarantee read consistency, a Raft-based system must either accept the high communication overhead of a safety check for each read, or implement leader leases. Prior lease protocols are vaguely specified and hurt availability, so most Raft systems implement them incorrectly or not at all. We introduce LeaseGuard, a novel lease algorithm that relies on guarantees specific to Raft elections. LeaseGuard is simple, rigorously specified in TLA+, and includes two novel optimizations that maximize availability during leader failover. The first optimization restores write throughput quickly, and the second improves read availability. We evaluate LeaseGuard with a simulation in Python and an implementation in LogCabin, the C++ reference implementation of Raft. By replacing LogCabin's default consistency mechanism (quorum checks), LeaseGuard reduces the overhead of consistent reads from one to zero network roundtrips. It also improves write throughput from ~1000 to ~10,000 writes per second, by eliminating contention between writes and quorum reads. Whereas traditional leases ban all reads on a new leader while it waits for a lease, in our LeaseGuard test the new leader instantly allows 99% of reads to succeed.

### 5. [Optimizing Bloom Filters for Modern GPU Architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15595v1)

Authors: Daniel Jünger, Kevin Kristensen, Yunsong Wang, Xiangyao Yu, Bertil Schmidt

Bloom filters are a fundamental data structure for approximate membership queries, with applications ranging from data analytics to databases and genomics. Several variants have been proposed to accommodate parallel architectures. GPUs, with massive thread-level parallelism and high-bandwidth memory, are a natural fit for accelerating these Bloom filter variants potentially to billions of operations per second. Although CPU-optimized implementations have been well studied, GPU designs remain underexplored. We close this gap by exploring the design space on GPUs along three dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency.
  Our evaluation shows that the combination of these optimization points strongly affects throughput, with the largest gains achieved when the filter fits within the GPU's cache domain. We examine how the hardware responds to different parameter configurations and relate these observations to measured performance trends. Crucially, our optimized design overcomes the conventional trade-off between speed and precision, delivering the throughput typically restricted to high-error variants while maintaining the superior accuracy of high-precision configurations. At iso error rate, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by $11.35\times$ ($15.4\times$) for bulk filter lookup (construction), respectively, achieving above $92\%$ of the practical speed-of-light across a wide range of configurations on a B200 GPU. We propose a modular CUDA/C++ implementation, which will be openly available soon.

Authors: Mohammed Lalou, Nader Mbarek, Abdallah Skender, Olivier Togni

We study completely independent spanning trees (CIST), \textit{i.e.}, trees that are both edge-disjoint and internally vertex-disjoint, in split graphs. We establish a correspondence between the existence of CIST in a split graph and some types of hypergraph colorings (panchromatic and bipanchromatic colorings) of its associated hypergraph, allowing us to obtain lower and upper bounds on the number of CIST. Using these relations, we prove that the problem of the existence of two CIST in a split graph is NP-complete. Finally, we formulate a conjecture on the bipanchromatic number of a hypergraph related to the results obtained for the number of CIST.

### 2. [A Constant-Factor Approximation for Directed Latency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15473v1)

Authors: Jannis Blauth, Ramin Mousavi

In the Directed Latency problem, we are given an asymmetric metric on a set of vertices (or clients), and a given depot $s$. We seek a path $P$ starting at $s$ and visiting all the clients so as to minimize the sum of client waiting times (also known as latency) before being visited on the path.
  In contrast to the symmetric version of this problem (also known as the Deliveryperson problem and the Repairperson problem in the literature), there are significant gaps in our understanding of Directed Latency. The best approximation factor has remained at $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of clients, for more than a decade [Friggstad, Salavatipour, and Svitkina, '13]. Only recently, [Friggstad and Swamy, '22] presented a constant-factor approximation but in quasi-polynomial time. Both results follow similar ideas: they consider buckets with geometrically-increasing distances, build paths in each bucket, and then stitch together all these paths to get a feasible solution. [Friggstad and Swamy, '22] showed if we guess a vertex from each bucket and augment a standard LP relaxation with these guesses, then one can reduce the stitching cost. Unfortunately, there are logarithmically many buckets so the running time of their algorithm is quasi-polynomial.
  In this paper, we present the first constant-factor approximation for Directed Latency in polynomial time by introducing a completely new way of bucketing which helps us strengthen a standard LP relaxation with less aggressive guessing. Although the resulting LP is no longer a relaxation of Directed Latency, it still admits a good solution. We present a rounding algorithm for fractional solutions of our LP, crucially exploiting the way we restricted the feasibility region of the LP formulation.

### 1. [Label-consistent clustering for evolving data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15210v1)

Authors: Ameet Gadekar, Aristides Gionis, Thibault Marette

Data analysis often involves an iterative process, where solutions must be continuously refined in response to new data. Typically, as new data becomes available, an existing solution must be updated to incorporate the latest information. In addition to seeking a high-quality solution for the task at hand, it is also crucial to ensure consistency by minimizing drastic changes from previous solutions. Applying this approach across many iterations, ensures that the solution evolves gradually and smoothly.
  In this paper, we study the above problem in the context of clustering, specifically focusing on the $k$-center problem. More precisely, we study the following problem: Given a set of points $X$, parameters $k$ and $b$, and a prior clustering solution $H$ for $X$, our goal is to compute a new solution $C$ for $X$, consisting of $k$ centers, which minimizes the clustering cost while introducing at most $b$ changes from $H$. We refer to this problem as label-consistent $k$-center, and we propose two constant-factor approximation algorithms for it. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods on real-world datasets.

Authors: Paul Bagourd, Julian Jang-Jaccard, Vincent Lenders, Alain Mermoud, Torsten Hoefler, Cornelius Hempel

Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.

We present Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars (GPiCA), photorealistic head avatars that can be generated from multi-view images and efficiently rendered on mobile devices. GPiCA utilizes a unique hybrid representation that combines a triangle mesh and anisotropic 3D Gaussians. This combination maximizes memory and rendering efficiency while maintaining a photorealistic appearance. The triangle mesh is highly efficient in representing surface areas like facial skin, while the 3D Gaussians effectively handle non-surface areas such as hair and beard. To this end, we develop a unified differentiable rendering pipeline that treats the mesh as a semi-transparent layer within the volumetric rendering paradigm of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We train neural networks to decode a facial expression code into three components: a 3D face mesh, an RGBA texture, and a set of 3D Gaussians. These components are rendered simultaneously in a unified rendering engine. The networks are trained using multi-view image supervision. Our results demonstrate that GPiCA achieves the realism of purely Gaussian-based avatars while matching the rendering performance of mesh-based avatars.

### 2. [Probabilistic Inclusion Depth for Fuzzy Contour Ensemble Visualization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15187v1)

Authors: Cenyang Wu, Daniel Klötzl, Qinhan Yu, Shudan Guo, Runhao Lin, Daniel Weiskopf, Liang Zhou

We propose Probabilistic Inclusion Depth (PID) for the ensemble visualization of scalar fields. By introducing a probabilistic inclusion operator $\subset_{\!p}$, our method is a general data depth model supporting ensembles of fuzzy contours, such as soft masks from modern segmentation methods, and conventional ensembles of binary contours. We also advocate to extend contour extraction in scalar field ensembles to become a fuzzy decision by considering the probabilistic distribution of an isovalue to encode the sensitivity information. To reduce the complexity of the data depth computation, an efficient approximation using the mean probabilistic contour is devised. Furthermore, an order of magnitude reduction in computational time is achieved with an efficient parallel algorithm on the GPU. Our new method enables the computation of contour boxplots for ensembles of probabilistic masks, ensembles defined on various types of grids, and large 3D ensembles that are not studied by existing methods. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated with numerical comparisons to existing techniques on synthetic datasets, through examples of real-world ensemble datasets, and expert feedback.

Authors: Chun Fang, Luowen Liu, Kun Huang, Tao Ruan, Sheng Yan, Zhen Wang, Huan Li, Qiang Liu, Xingxing Wang

Recently, joint advertising has gained significant attention as an effective approach to enhancing the efficiency and revenue of advertising slot allocation. Unlike traditional advertising, which allocates advertising slots exclusively to a single advertiser, joint advertising displays advertisements from brands and stores that have established a joint selling relationship within the same advertising slot. However, existing approaches often struggle to accommodate both joint and traditional advertising frameworks, thereby limiting the revenue potential and generalizability of joint advertising. Furthermore, these methods are constrained by two critical limitations: they generally neglect the influence of global externalities, and they fail to address the bidding variability stemming from multi-party advertiser participation. Collectively, these limitations present substantial challenges to the design of joint auction mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose a Joint Auction Framework incorporating Externalities and Adaptation, and leverage the automated mechanism design (AMD) method through our proposed JEANet to compute joint auction mechanisms that satisfy the conditions of individual rationality (IR) and approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). As the first AMD method to integrate global externalities into joint auctions, JEANet dynamically adapts to the bidding characteristics of multi-party advertiser and enables unified auctions that integrate both joint and traditional advertising. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that JEANet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multi-slot joint auctions.

### 2. [A Decision-Theoretic Approach for Managing Misalignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15584v1)

Authors: Daniel A. Herrmann, Abinav Chari, Isabelle Qian, Sree Sharvesh, B. A. Levinstein

When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.

Authors: Pilyoung Kim, Yun Xie, Sujin Yang

General-purpose conversational AI chatbots and AI companions increasingly provide young adolescents with emotionally supportive conversations, raising questions about how conversational style shapes anthropomorphism and emotional reliance. In a preregistered online experiment with 284 adolescent-parent dyads, youth aged 11-15 and their parents read two matched transcripts in which a chatbot responded to an everyday social problem using either a relational style (first-person, affiliative, commitment language) or a transparent style (explicit nonhumanness, informational tone). Adolescents more often preferred the relational than the transparent style, whereas parents were more likely to prefer transparent style than adolescents. Adolescents rated the relational chatbot as more human-like, likable, trustworthy and emotionally close, while perceiving both styles as similarly helpful. Adolescents who preferred relational style had lower family and peer relationship quality and higher stress and anxiety than those preferring transparent style or both chatbots. These findings identify conversational style as a key design lever for youth AI safety, showing that relational framing heightens anthropomorphism, trust and emotional closeness and can be especially appealing to socially and emotionally vulnerable adolescents, who may be at increased risk for emotional reliance on conversational AI.

### 2. [Human-Centered AI Maturity Model (HCAI-MM): An Organizational Design Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14977v1)

Authors: Stuart Winby, Wei Xu

Human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) is an approach to AI design, development, and deployment that prioritizes human needs, values, and experiences, ensuring that technology enhances human capabilities, well-being, and workforce empowerment. While HCAI has gained prominence in academic discourse and organizational practice, its implementation remains constrained by the absence of methodological guidance and structured frameworks. In particular, HCAI and organizational design practices are often treated separately, despite their interdependence in shaping effective socio-technical systems. This chapter addresses this gap by introducing the Human-Centered AI Maturity Model (HCAI-MM), a structured framework that enables organizations to evaluate, monitor, and advance their capacity to design and implement HCAI solutions. The model specifies stages of maturity, metrics, tools, governance mechanisms, and best practices, supported by case studies, while also incorporating an organizational design methodology that operationalizes maturity progression. Encompassing dimensions such as human-AI collaboration, explainability, fairness, and user experience, the HCAI-MM provides a roadmap for organizations to move from novice to advanced levels of maturity, aligning AI technologies with human values and organizational design principles.

### 3. [Exploring User Acceptance and Concerns toward LLM-powered Conversational Agents in Immersive Extended Reality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15343v1)

Authors: Efe Bozkir, Enkelejda Kasneci

The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), and the availability of services that make them accessible, have led the general public to begin incorporating them into everyday life. The extended reality (XR) community has also sought to integrate LLMs, particularly in the form of conversational agents, to enhance user experience and task efficiency. When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues. To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential. Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location. We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust. Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance. In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings. We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive. Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful. We conclude with implications and recommendations for LLM-powered XR.

Authors: Sarah Kaißer, Markus Kleffmann, Kristina Schaaff

Gamification is widely used in digital learning. However, most systems neglect age-related differences. This paper investigates how gamification can be designed in an age-aware way to address learners' diverse motivational and cognitive needs. Based on a targeted literature review, we present a mapping of age groups, mechanics, and effects. Furthermore, we derive five design principles for age-specific gamification and identify three technical patterns for implementation in multimedia learning environments. The results indicate that gamification is not universally effective, but rather requires a differentiated design to support engagement and inclusivity across the lifespan.

### 5. [Managing Ambiguity: A Proof of Concept of Human-AI Symbiotic Sense-making based on Quantum-Inspired Cognitive Mechanism of Rogue Variable Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15325v1)

Authors: Agnieszka Bienkowska, Jacek Malecki, Alexander Mathiesen-Ohman, Katarzyna Tworek

Organizations increasingly operate in environments characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), where early indicators of change often emerge as weak, fragmented signals. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used to support managerial decision-making, most AI-based systems remain optimized for prediction and resolution, leading to premature interpretive closure under conditions of high ambiguity. This creates a gap in management science regarding how human-AI systems can responsibly manage ambiguity before it crystallizes into error or crisis. This study addresses this gap by presenting a proof of concept (PoC) of the LAIZA human-AI augmented symbiotic intelligence system and its patented process: Systems and Methods for Quantum-Inspired Rogue Variable Modeling (QRVM), Human-in-the-Loop Decoherence, and Collective Cognitive Inference. The mechanism operationalizes ambiguity as a non-collapsed cognitive state, detects persistent interpretive breakdowns (rogue variables), and activates structured human-in-the-loop clarification when autonomous inference becomes unreliable. Empirically, the article draws on a three-month case study conducted in 2025 within the AI development, involving prolonged ambiguity surrounding employee intentions and intellectual property boundaries. The findings show that preserving interpretive plurality enabled early scenario-based preparation, including proactive patent protection, allowing decisive and disruption-free action once ambiguity collapsed. The study contributes to management theory by reframing ambiguity as a first-class construct and demonstrates the practical value of human-AI symbiosis for organizational resilience in VUCA environments.

Authors: Mia Mohammad Imran, Robert Zita, Rahat Rizvi Rahman, Preetha Chatterjee, Kostadin Damevski

Toxic interactions in Open Source Software (OSS) communities reduce contributor engagement and threaten project sustainability. Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.
  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of structured LLM prompting for early detection of conversational derailment in OSS, enabling proactive and explainable moderation.

Authors: Vahid Pooryousef, Tim Dwyer, Richard Bassed, Maxime Cordeil, Lonni Besançon

Research studies involving human participants present challenges, including strict ethical considerations, participant recruitment, costs, and many human factors. While human-computer interaction researchers are familiar with these challenges and current solutions, expert-centred studies can be even more challenging in ways that researchers may not anticipate. This issue is particularly important as research grants are increasingly based on practical and real-world problems, which necessitate close collaboration with experts. In this paper, we reflect on and discuss the challenges, solutions, and specific requirements that arose during our expert-centred studies conducted over three years of a PhD study exploring immersive forensic investigation.

### 8. [A Network-Based Framework for Modeling and Analyzing Human-Robot Coordination Strategies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15282v1)

Authors: Martijn IJtsma, Salvatore Hargis

Studies of human-robot interaction in dynamic and unstructured environments show that as more advanced robotic capabilities are deployed, the need for cooperative competencies to support collaboration with human problem-holders increases. Designing human-robot systems to meet these demands requires an explicit understanding of the work functions and constraints that shape the feasibility of alternative joint work strategies. Yet existing human-robot interaction frameworks either emphasize computational support for real-time execution or rely on static representations for design, offering limited support for reasoning about coordination dynamics during early-stage conceptual design. To address this gap, this article presents a novel computational framework for analyzing joint work strategies in human-robot systems by integrating techniques from functional modeling with graph-theoretic representations. The framework characterizes collective work in terms of the relationships among system functions and the physical and informational structure of the work environment, while explicitly capturing how coordination demands evolve over time. Its use during conceptual design is demonstrated through a case study in disaster robotics, which shows how the framework can be used to support early trade-space exploration of human-robot coordination strategies and to identify cooperative competencies that support flexible management of coordination overhead. These results show how the framework makes coordination demands and their temporal evolution explicit, supporting design-time reasoning about cooperative competency requirements and work demands prior to implementation.

Joint Attention (JA), a crucial social skill for developing shared focus, is often impaired in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), affecting social communication and highlighting the need for early intervention. Addressing gaps in prior research, such as limited use of immersive technology and reliance on distracting peripherals, we developed a novel JA training platform using Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) devices. The platform integrates eye gaze-based interactions to ensure participants undivided attention. To validate the platform, we conducted experiments on ASD (N=19) and Neurotypical (NT) (N=13) participants under a trained pediatric neurologist's supervision. For quantitative analysis, we employed key measures such as the number of correct responses, the duration of establishing eye contact (s), and the duration of registering a response (s), along with correlations to CARS scores and age. Results from AR-based experiments showed NT participants registered responses significantly faster (<0.00001) than ASD participants. A correlation (Spearman coefficient=0.57, p=0.03) was found between ASD participants response time and CARS scores. A similar trend was observed in VR-based experiments. When comparing response accuracy in ASD participants across platforms, AR yielded a higher correctness rate (92.30%) than VR (69.49%), indicating AR's greater effectiveness. These findings suggest that immersive technology can aid JA training in ASD. Future studies should explore long-term benefits and real-world applicability.

Authors: Omar Namnakani, Yasmeen Abdrabou, Jonathan Grizou, Mohamed Khamis

The potential of gaze for hands-free mobile interaction is increasingly evident. While each gaze input technique presents distinct advantages and limitations, a combination can amplify strengths and mitigate challenges. We report on the results of a user study (N=24), in which we compared the usability and performance of pairing three popular gaze input techniques: Dwell Time, Pursuits, and Gaze Gestures, for navigation and selection tasks while sitting and walking. Results show that pairing gestures for navigation with either Dwell time or Pursuits for selection improves task completion time and rate compared to using either individually. We discuss the implications of pairing gaze input techniques, such as how Pursuits may negatively impact other techniques, likely due to the visual clutter it adds, how integrating gestures for navigation reduces the chances of unintentional selections, and the impact of motor activity on performance. Our findings provide insights for effective gaze-enabled interfaces.

### 1. [DASH: Dialogue-Aware Similarity and Handshake Recognition for Topic Segmentation in Public-Channel Conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15042v1)

Authors: Sijin Sun, Liangbin Zhao, Ming Deng, Xiuju Fu

Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) is crucial for understanding task-oriented public-channel communications, such as maritime VHF dialogues, which feature informal speech and implicit transitions. To address the limitations of traditional methods, we propose DASH-DTS, a novel LLM-based framework. Its core contributions are: (1) topic shift detection via dialogue handshake recognition; (2) contextual enhancement through similarity-guided example selection; and (3) the generation of selective positive and negative samples to improve model discrimination and robustness. Additionally, we release VHF-Dial, the first public dataset of real-world maritime VHF communications, to advance research in this domain. DASH-DTS provides interpretable reasoning and confidence scores for each segment. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves several sota segmentation trusted accuracy on both VHF-Dial and standard benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for stable monitoring and decision support in operational dialogues.

We present MedNuggetizer, https://mednugget-ai.de/; access is available upon request.}, a tool for query-driven extraction and clustering of information nuggets from medical documents to support clinicians in exploring underlying medical evidence. Backed by a large language model (LLM), \textit{MedNuggetizer} performs repeated extractions of information nuggets that are then grouped to generate reliable evidence within and across multiple documents. We demonstrate its utility on the clinical use case of \textit{antibiotic prophylaxis before prostate biopsy} by using major urological guidelines and recent PubMed studies as sources of information. Evaluation by domain experts shows that \textit{MedNuggetizer} provides clinicians and researchers with an efficient way to explore long documents and easily extract reliable, query-focused medical evidence.

### 3. [Image Complexity-Aware Adaptive Retrieval for Efficient Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15372v1)

Authors: Mikel Williams-Lekuona, Georgina Cosma

Vision transformers in vision-language models apply uniform computational effort across all images, expending 175.33 GFLOPs (ViT-L/14) whether analysing a straightforward product photograph or a complex street scene. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.

Authors: Gajendra Doniparthi, Shashank Balu Pandhare, Stefan Deßloch, Timo Mühlhaus

Traditional search applications within Research Data Management (RDM) ecosystems are crucial in helping users discover and explore the structured metadata from the research datasets. Typically, text search engines require users to submit keyword-based queries rather than using natural language. However, using Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on domain-specific content for specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks is becoming increasingly common. We present ArcBERT, an LLM-based system designed for integrated metadata exploration. ArcBERT understands natural language queries and relies on semantic matching, unlike traditional search applications. Notably, ArcBERT also understands the structure and hierarchies within the metadata, enabling it to handle diverse user querying patterns effectively.

Authors: Abdullah Al Munem, Sumona Yeasmin, Mohammad Rezwanul Huq

Every day, a significant number of users visit the internet for different needs. The owners of a website generate profits from the user interaction with the contents or items of the website. A robust recommendation system can increase user interaction with a website by recommending items according to the user's unique preferences. BERT and CNN-integrated neural collaborative filtering (NCF) have been proposed for the recommendation system in this experiment. The proposed model takes inputs from the user and item profile and finds the user's interest. This model can handle numeric, categorical, and image data to extract the latent features from the inputs. The model is trained and validated on a small sample of the MovieLens dataset for 25 epochs. The same dataset has been used to train and validate a simple NCF and a BERT-based NCF model and compared with the proposed model. The proposed model outperformed those two baseline models. The obtained result for the proposed model is 0.72 recall and 0.486 Hit Ratio @ 10 for 799 users on the MovieLens dataset. This experiment concludes that considering both categorical and image data can improve the performance of a recommendation system.

Authors: Aleksei Shestov, Anton Klenitskiy, Daria Denisova, Amurkhan Dzagkoev, Daniil Petrovich, Andrey Savchenko, Maksim Makarenko

Modern representation learning increasingly relies on unsupervised and self-supervised methods trained on large-scale unlabeled data. While these approaches achieve impressive generalization across tasks and domains, evaluating embedding quality without labels remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose Persistence, a topology-aware metric based on persistent homology that quantifies the geometric structure and topological richness of embedding spaces in a fully unsupervised manner. Unlike metrics that assume linear separability or rely on covariance structure, Persistence captures global and multi-scale organization. Empirical results across diverse domains show that Persistence consistently achieves top-tier correlations with downstream performance, outperforming existing unsupervised metrics and enabling reliable model and hyperparameter selection.

Authors: Sanghyeok Chung, Eujin Kim, Donggun Kim, Gaeun Heo, Jeongbin You, Nahyun Lee, Sunmook Choi, Soyul Han, Seungsang Oh, Il-Youp Kwak

Recent advances in audio generation have increased the risk of realistic environmental sound manipulation, motivating the ESDD 2026 Challenge as the first large-scale benchmark for Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection (ESDD). We propose BEAT2AASIST which extends BEATs-AASIST by splitting BEATs-derived representations along frequency or channel dimension and processing them with dual AASIST branches. To enrich feature representations, we incorporate top-k transformer layer fusion using concatenation, CNN-gated, and SE-gated strategies. In addition, vocoder-based data augmentation is applied to improve robustness against unseen spoofing methods. Experimental results on the official test sets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance across the challenge tracks.

### 2. [From Risk to Resilience: Towards Assessing and Mitigating the Risk of Data Reconstruction Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15460v1)

Authors: Xiangrui Xu, Zhize Li, Yufei Han, Bin Wang, Jiqiang Liu, Wei Wang

Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) pose a significant threat to Federated Learning (FL) systems by enabling adversaries to infer sensitive training data from local clients. Despite extensive research, the question of how to characterize and assess the risk of DRAs in FL systems remains unresolved due to the lack of a theoretically-grounded risk quantification framework. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives. First, we show that DRA risk is governed by the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix of exchanged model updates or feature embeddings, providing a unified explanation for the effectiveness of defense methods. Second, we develop InvRE, an InvLoss-based DRA risk estimator that offers attack method-agnostic, comprehensive risk evaluation across data instances and model architectures. Third, we propose two adaptive noise perturbation defenses that enhance FL privacy without harming classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate our framework, demonstrating its potential for systematic DRA risk evaluation and mitigation in FL systems.

Authors: Julian Oelhaf, Mehran Pashaei, Georg Kordowich, Christian Bergler, Andreas Maier, Johann Jäger, Siming Bayer

The growing penetration of renewable and distributed generation is transforming power systems and challenging conventional protection schemes that rely on fixed settings and local measurements. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.
  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.

### 4. [Time-Varying Audio Effect Modeling by End-to-End Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15313v1)

Authors: Yann Bourdin, Pierrick Legrand, Fanny Roche

Deep learning has become a standard approach for the modeling of audio effects, yet strictly black-box modeling remains problematic for time-varying systems. Unlike time-invariant effects, training models on devices with internal modulation typically requires the recording or extraction of control signals to ensure the time-alignment required by standard loss functions. This paper introduces a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to model such effects using only input-output audio recordings, removing the need for modulation signal extraction. We propose a convolutional-recurrent architecture trained via a two-stage strategy: an initial adversarial phase allows the model to learn the distribution of the modulation behavior without strict phase constraints, followed by a supervised fine-tuning phase where a State Prediction Network (SPN) estimates the initial internal states required to synchronize the model with the target. Additionally, a new objective metric based on chirp-train signals is developed to quantify modulation accuracy. Experiments modeling a vintage hardware phaser demonstrate the method's ability to capture time-varying dynamics in a fully black-box context.

### 5. [High-Dimensional Partial Least Squares: Spectral Analysis and Fundamental Limitations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15684v1)

Authors: Victor Léger, Florent Chatelain

Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a widely used method for data integration, designed to extract latent components shared across paired high-dimensional datasets. Despite decades of practical success, a precise theoretical understanding of its behavior in high-dimensional regimes remains limited. In this paper, we study a data integration model in which two high-dimensional data matrices share a low-rank common latent structure while also containing individual-specific components. We analyze the singular vectors of the associated cross-covariance matrix using tools from random matrix theory and derive asymptotic characterizations of the alignment between estimated and true latent directions. These results provide a quantitative explanation of the reconstruction performance of the PLS variant based on Singular Value Decomposition (PLS-SVD) and identify regimes where the method exhibits counter-intuitive or limiting behavior. Building on this analysis, we compare PLS-SVD with principal component analysis applied separately to each dataset and show its asymptotic superiority in detecting the common latent subspace. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive theoretical understanding of high-dimensional PLS-SVD, clarifying both its advantages and fundamental limitations.

Authors: Carlos Couto, José Mourão, Mário A. T. Figueiredo, Pedro Ribeiro

Near an optimal learning point of a neural network, the learning performance of gradient descent dynamics is dictated by the Hessian matrix of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. We characterize the Hessian eigenspectrum for some classes of teacher-student problems, when the teacher and student networks have matching weights, showing that the smaller eigenvalues of the Hessian determine long-time learning performance. For linear networks, we analytically establish that for large networks the spectrum asymptotically follows a convolution of a scaled chi-square distribution with a scaled Marchenko-Pastur distribution. We numerically analyse the Hessian spectrum for polynomial and other non-linear networks. Furthermore, we show that the rank of the Hessian matrix can be seen as an effective number of parameters for networks using polynomial activation functions. For a generic non-linear activation function, such as the error function, we empirically observe that the Hessian matrix is always full rank.

### 7. [Corrective Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15596v1)

Authors: Shuibai Zhang, Fred Zhangzhi Peng, Yiheng Zhang, Jin Pan, Grigorios G. Chrysos

Diffusion language models are structurally well-suited for iterative error correction, as their non-causal denoising dynamics allow arbitrary positions in a sequence to be revised. However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangshuibai/CDLM.

Authors: Yuan Wang, Oleksandr Kyriienko

Photonics can offer a hardware-native route for machine learning (ML). However, efficient deployment of photonics-enhanced ML requires hybrid workflows that integrate optical processing with conventional CPU/GPU based neural network architectures. Here, we propose such a workflow that combines photonic positional embeddings (PEs) with advanced graph ML models. We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs. Our results show that photonic PEs improve GCN performance and support optical acceleration of graph ML.

Authors: Oleg Melnikov, Yurii Dorofieiev, Yurii Shakhnovskiy, Huy Truong, Victoria Degeler

This paper presents a unified framework, for the detection, classification, and preliminary localization of anomalies in water distribution networks using multivariate statistical analysis. The approach, termed SICAMS (Statistical Identification and Classification of Anomalies in Mahalanobis Space), processes heterogeneous pressure and flow sensor data through a whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations among measurements. Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall "health" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network. Application of the proposed framework to the BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintaining robust performance even under multiple leaks. These capabilities make the method applicable to real-world operational environments without the need for a calibrated hydraulic model.

Authors: Victor M. Yeom Song, Severi Rissanen, Arno Solin, Samuel Kaski, Mingfei Sun

Diffusion models struggle to produce samples that respect constraints, a common requirement in scientific applications. Recent approaches have introduced regularization terms in the loss or guidance methods during sampling to enforce such constraints, but they bias the generative model away from the true data distribution. This is a problem, especially when the constraint is misspecified, a common issue when formulating constraints on scientific data. In this paper, instead of changing the loss or the sampling loop, we integrate a guidance-inspired adjustment into the denoiser itself, giving it a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples. We show that these softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers, and maintain enough flexibility to deviate from it when there is misspecification with observed data.

### 1. [Offline Multi-Task Multi-Objective Data-Driven Evolutionary Algorithm with Language Surrogate Model and Implicit Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15149v1)

Authors: Xian-Rong Zhang, Yue-Jiao Gong, Zeyuan Ma, Jun Zhang

Data-driven evolutionary algorithms has shown surprising results in addressing expensive optimization problems through robust surrogate modeling. Though promising, existing surrogate modeling schemes may encounter limitations in complex optimization problems with many sub-objectives, which rely on repeated and tedious approximation. To address such technical gap, we propose Q-MetaSur as a plug-and-play surrogate modeling scheme capable of providing unified and generalized surrogate learning. Specifically, we consider multi-task-multi-objective optimization~(MTMOO) in offline setting. Several key designs are proposed: 1) we transform objective approximation into sequence-to-sequence modeling where MTMOO problem can be represented by tenxual tokenization. To operate under such auto-regressive modeling, we introduce a Large Language Model-based surrogate model that first encodes a MTMOO instance and then decodes objective values of unseen decision variables. To ensure stability in training the proposed model, we propose a two-stage offline training strategy that operates as a synergy of supervised tuning and RL fine-tuning, which first exploits offline dataset to fit existing knowledge and then leverages RL to enhance model's generalization performance. Extensive empirical results on the CEC2019 benchmark demonstrate that Q-MetaSur not only outperforms representative surrogate baselines in objective approximation accuracy, but also helps underlying evolutionary algorithms achieve both desired optimization convergence and improved pareto optimality.

Authors: Peili Mao, Joseph Billingsley, Wang Miao, Geyong Mi, Ke Li

Modern data centers contain thousands of servers making them major consumers of electricity. To minimize their environmental impact, it is critical that we use their resources efficiently. In this paper we study how to discover the optimal placement of virtual network functions in large scale data centers. We propose a novel parallel metaheuristic, fast heuristic objective functions of the QoS and new memory efficient data structures for large networks. We further identify a simple, fast heuristic that can produce competitive solutions to very large problem instances. Using these new concepts, we are able to find high quality solutions for data centres with up to 64,000 servers.

### 3. [Dense Associative Memories with Analog Circuits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15002v1)

Authors: Marc Gong Bacvanski, Xincheng You, John Hopfield, Dmitry Krotov

The increasing computational demands of modern AI systems have exposed fundamental limitations of digital hardware, driving interest in alternative paradigms for efficient large-scale inference. Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) is a family of models that offers a flexible framework for representing many contemporary neural architectures, such as transformers and diffusion models, by casting them as dynamical systems evolving on an energy landscape. In this work, we propose a general method for building analog accelerators for DenseAMs and implementing them using electronic RC circuits, crossbar arrays, and amplifiers. We find that our analog DenseAM hardware performs inference in constant time independent of model size. This result highlights an asymptotic advantage of analog DenseAMs over digital numerical solvers that scale at least linearly with the model size. We consider three settings of progressively increasing complexity: XOR, the Hamming (7,4) code, and a simple language model defined on binary variables. We propose analog implementations of these three models and analyze the scaling of inference time, energy consumption, and hardware. Finally, we estimate lower bounds on the achievable time constants imposed by amplifier specifications, suggesting that even conservative existing analog technology can enable inference times on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds. By harnessing the intrinsic parallelism and continuous-time operation of analog circuits, our DenseAM-based accelerator design offers a new avenue for fast and scalable AI hardware.

### 1. [UAV-enabled Computing Power Networks: Task Completion Probability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15173v1)

Authors: Yiqin Deng, Zhengru Fang, Senkang Hu, Yanan Ma, Haixia Zhang, Yuguang Fang

This paper presents an innovative framework that synergistically enhances computing performance through ubiquitous computing power distribution and dynamic computing node accessibility control via adaptive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) positioning, establishing UAV-enabled Computing Power Networks (UAV-CPNs). In UAV-CPNs, UAVs function as dynamic aerial relays, outsourcing tasks generated in the request zone to an expanded service zone, consisting of a diverse range of computing devices, from vehicles with onboard computational capabilities and edge servers to dedicated computing nodes. This approach has the potential to alleviate communication bottlenecks in traditional computing power networks and overcome the "island effect" observed in multi-access edge computing. However, how to quantify the network performance under the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of both communication and computing power is a significant challenge, which introduces intricacies beyond those found in conventional networks. To address this, in this paper, we introduce task completion probability as the primary performance metric for evaluating the ability of UAV-CPNs to complete ground users' tasks within specified end-to-end latency requirements. Utilizing theories from stochastic processes and stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions that facilitate the assessment of this metric. Our numerical results emphasize that striking a delicate balance between communication and computational capabilities is essential for enhancing the performance of UAV-CPNs. Moreover, our findings show significant performance gains from the widespread distribution of computing nodes.

Authors: Nadia Abdolkhani, Nada Abdel Khalek, Walaa Hamouda, Iyad Dayoub

This letter presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for joint time allocation and power control in a cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The CIoT transmitter autonomously manages energy harvesting (EH) and transmissions using a learnable time switching factor while optimizing power to enhance throughput and lifetime. The joint optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process under small-scale fading, realistic EH, and interference constraints. We develop a double deep Q-network (DDQN) enhanced with an upper confidence bound. Simulations benchmark our approach, showing superior performance over existing DRL methods.

Authors: Antoine Bernard, Sandoche Balakrichenan, Michel Marot, Benoit Ampeau

LPWANs are networks characterised by the scarcity of their radio resources and their limited payload size. LoRaWAN offers an open, easy-to-deploy and efficient solution to operate a long-range network. To efficiently communicate using IPv6, the LPWAN working group from the IETF developed a solution called Static Context Header Compression (SCHC). It uses context rules, which are linked to a given End Device, to compress the IPv6 and UDP header. Since there may be a huge variety of End Devices profile, it makes sense to store the rules remotely and use a system to retrieve the profiles dynamically. In this paper we propose a mechanism based on DNS to find the context rules associated with an End Device, allowing it to be downloaded from an HTTP Server. We evaluate the corresponding delay added to the communications using experimental measurements from a real testbed.

Authors: Wenwen Xie, Geng Sun, Ruichen Zhang, Xuejie Liu, Yinqiu Liu, Jiacheng Wang, Dusit Niyato, Ping Zhang

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key development direction in the sixth-generation (6G) era, which provides essential support for the collaborative sensing and communication of future intelligent networks. However, as wireless environments become increasingly dynamic and complex, ISAC systems require more intelligent processing and more autonomous operation to maintain efficiency and adaptability. Meanwhile, agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a feasible solution to address these challenges by enabling continuous perception-reasoning-action loops in dynamic environments to support intelligent, autonomous, and efficient operation for ISAC systems. As such, we delve into the application value and prospects of agentic AI in ISAC systems in this work. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive review of agentic AI and ISAC systems to demonstrate their key characteristics. Secondly, we show several common optimization approaches for ISAC systems and highlight the significant advantages of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based agentic AI. Thirdly, we propose a novel agentic ISAC framework and prensent a case study to verify its superiority in optimizing ISAC performance. Finally, we clarify future research directions for agentic AI-based ISAC systems.

### 5. [GenAI-enabled Residual Motion Estimation for Energy-Efficient Semantic Video Communication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15481v1)

Authors: Shavbo Salehi, Pedro Enrique Iturria-Rivera, Medhat Elsayed, Majid Bavand, Yigit Ozcan, Melike Erol-Kantarci

Semantic communication addresses the limitations of the Shannon paradigm by focusing on transmitting meaning rather than exact representations, thereby reducing unnecessary resource consumption. This is particularly beneficial for video, which dominates network traffic and demands high bandwidth and power, making semantic approaches ideal for conserving resources while maintaining quality. In this paper, we propose a Predictability-aware and Entropy-adaptive Neural Motion Estimation (PENME) method to address challenges related to high latency, high bitrate, and power consumption in video transmission. PENME makes per-frame decisions to select a residual motion extraction model, convolutional neural network, vision transformer, or optical flow, using a five-step policy based on motion strength, global motion consistency, peak sharpness, heterogeneity, and residual error. The residual motions are then transmitted to the receiver, where the frames are reconstructed via motion-compensated updates. Next, a selective diffusion-based refinement, the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-4), is applied on frames that trigger refinement due to low predictability or large residuals, while predictable frames skip refinement. PENME also allocates radio resource blocks with awareness of residual motion and channel state, reducing power consumption and bandwidth usage while maintaining high semantic similarity. Our simulation results on the Vimeo90K dataset demonstrate that the proposed PENME method handles various types of video, outperforming traditional communication, hybrid, and adaptive bitrate semantic communication techniques, achieving 40% lower latency, 90% less transmitted data, and 35% higher throughput. For semantic communication metrics, PENME improves PSNR by about 40%, increases MS-SSIM by roughly 19%, and reduces LPIPS by nearly 35%, compared with the baseline methods.

### 6. [Attention in Motion: Secure Platooning via Transformer-based Misbehavior Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15503v1)

Authors: Konstantinos Kalogiannis, Ahmed Mohamed Hussain, Hexu Li, Panos Papadimitratos

Vehicular platooning promises transformative improvements in transportation efficiency and safety through the coordination of multi-vehicle formations enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused (BCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms. Hence, validating AIMformer is viable for both in-vehicle and roadside infrastructure deployment.

Authors: Dao Thanh Hai, Shuo Li, Isaac Woungang

Driven by massive investments and consequently significant progresses in optical computing and all-optical signal processing technologies lately, this paper presents a new architectural paradigm for next-generation optical transport network, entitled \textit{optical computing-communication integrated network}, which is capable of providing dual services at the optical layer, namely, computing and communication. This approach seeks to exploit the potential for performing optical computing operations among lightpaths that traverse the same intermediate node. \textit{Optical-layer intelligence concept} is thus introduced as the capability to perform computing / processing at the lightpath scale to achieve greater spectral and/or computing efficiency. A case study focusing on optical aggregation operation is introduced, highlighting the key differences between optical computing-communication integrated network and its current counterpart, optical-bypass ones. A mathematical formulation for optimal designs of optical-aggregation-enabled network is then provided and performance comparison with traditional optical-bypass model is drawn on the realistic NSFNET topology.

### 8. [Deep Reinforcement Learning for EH-Enabled Cognitive-IoT Under Jamming Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15558v1)

Authors: Nadia Abdolkhani, Nada Abdel Khalek, Walaa Hamouda

In the evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating cognitive radio (CR) has become a practical solution to address the challenge of spectrum scarcity, leading to the development of cognitive IoT (CIoT). However, the vulnerability of radio communications makes radio jamming attacks a key concern in CIoT networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach designed to optimize throughput and extend network lifetime of an energy-constrained CIoT system under jamming attacks. This DRL framework equips a CIoT device with the autonomy to manage energy harvesting (EH) and data transmission, while also regulating its transmit power to respect spectrum-sharing constraints. We formulate the optimization problem under various constraints, and we model the CIoT device's interactions within the channel as a model-free Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP serves as a foundation to develop a double deep Q-network (DDQN), designed to help the CIoT agent learn the optimal communication policy to navigate challenges such as dynamic channel occupancy, jamming attacks, and channel fading while achieving its goal. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, named UCB-IA, which enhances the CIoT network's ability to efficiently navigate jamming attacks within the channel. The proposed DRL algorithm does not rely on prior knowledge and uses locally observable information such as channel occupancy, jamming activity, channel gain, and energy arrival to make decisions. Extensive simulations prove that our proposed DRL algorithm that utilizes the UCB-IA strategy surpasses existing benchmarks, allowing for a more adaptive, energy-efficient, and secure spectrum sharing in CIoT networks.

### 9. [Packet-Level Traffic Modeling with Heavy-Tailed Payload and Inter-Arrival Distributions for Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15432v1)

Authors: Enes Koktas, Peter Rost

Digital twins of radio access networks require packet-level traffic generators that reproduce the size and timing of packets while remaining compact and easy to recalibrate as traffic changes. We address this need with a hybrid generator that combines a small hidden Markov model, which captures buffering, streaming, and idle states, with a mixture density network that models the joint distribution of payload length and inter-arrival time (IAT) in each state using Student-t mixtures. The state space and emission family are designed to handle heavy-tailed IAT by anchoring an explicit idle state in the tail and allowing each component to adapt its tail thickness. We evaluate the model on public traces of web, smart home, and encrypted media traffic and compare it with recent neural network and transformer based generators as well as hidden Markov baselines. Across most datasets and metrics, including average per-flow cumulative distribution functions, autocorrelation based measures of temporal structure, and Wasserstein distances between flow descriptors, the proposed generator matches the real traffic most closely in the majority of cases while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters. The full model occupies around 0.2 MB in our experiments, which makes it suitable for deployment inside digital twins where memory footprint and low-overhead adaptation are critical.

Authors: Michael Amir, Manon Flageat, Amanda Prorok

The success of machine learning for real-world robotic systems has created a new form of intellectual property: the trained policy. This raises a critical need for novel methods that verify ownership and detect unauthorized, possibly unsafe misuse. While watermarking is established in other domains, physical policies present a unique challenge: remote detection. Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity. To show it does not degrade performance, we prove CoNoCo preserves the marginal action distribution. Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments. This work provides a necessary step toward protecting intellectual property in robotics, offering the first method for validating the provenance of physical policies non-invasively, using purely remote observations.

Authors: Pilyoung Kim, Yun Xie, Sujin Yang

General-purpose conversational AI chatbots and AI companions increasingly provide young adolescents with emotionally supportive conversations, raising questions about how conversational style shapes anthropomorphism and emotional reliance. In a preregistered online experiment with 284 adolescent-parent dyads, youth aged 11-15 and their parents read two matched transcripts in which a chatbot responded to an everyday social problem using either a relational style (first-person, affiliative, commitment language) or a transparent style (explicit nonhumanness, informational tone). Adolescents more often preferred the relational than the transparent style, whereas parents were more likely to prefer transparent style than adolescents. Adolescents rated the relational chatbot as more human-like, likable, trustworthy and emotionally close, while perceiving both styles as similarly helpful. Adolescents who preferred relational style had lower family and peer relationship quality and higher stress and anxiety than those preferring transparent style or both chatbots. These findings identify conversational style as a key design lever for youth AI safety, showing that relational framing heightens anthropomorphism, trust and emotional closeness and can be especially appealing to socially and emotionally vulnerable adolescents, who may be at increased risk for emotional reliance on conversational AI.

### 3. [Load-Based Variable Transmission Mechanism for Robotic Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15448v1)

Authors: Sinan Emre, Victor Barasuol, Matteo Villa, Claudio Semini

This paper presents a Load-Based Variable Transmission (LBVT) mechanism designed to enhance robotic actuation by dynamically adjusting the transmission ratio in response to external torque demands. Unlike existing variable transmission systems that require additional actuators for active control, the proposed LBVT mechanism leverages a pre-tensioned spring and a four-bar linkage to passively modify the transmission ratio, thereby reducing the complexity of robot joint actuation systems. The effectiveness of the LBVT mechanism is evaluated through simulation-based analyses. The results confirm that the system achieves up to a 40 percent increase in transmission ratio upon reaching a predefined torque threshold, effectively amplifying joint torque when required without additional actuation. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate a torque amplification effect triggered when the applied force exceeds 18 N, highlighting the system ability to autonomously respond to varying load conditions. This research contributes to the development of lightweight, efficient, and adaptive transmission systems for robotic applications, particularly in legged robots where dynamic torque adaptation is critical.

Authors: Yuze Wu, Mo Zhu, Xingxing Li, Yuheng Du, Yuxin Fan, Wenjun Li, Xin Zhou, Fei Gao

This paper proposes VLA-AN, an efficient and onboard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework dedicated to autonomous drone navigation in complex environments. VLA-AN addresses four major limitations of existing large aerial navigation models: the data domain gap, insufficient temporal navigation with reasoning, safety issues with generative action policies, and onboard deployment constraints. First, we construct a high-fidelity dataset utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to effectively bridge the domain gap. Second, we introduce a progressive three-stage training framework that sequentially reinforces scene comprehension, core flight skills, and complex navigation capabilities. Third, we design a lightweight, real-time action module coupled with geometric safety correction. This module ensures fast, collision-free, and stable command generation, mitigating the safety risks inherent in stochastic generative policies. Finally, through deep optimization of the onboard deployment pipeline, VLA-AN achieves a robust real-time 8.3x improvement in inference throughput on resource-constrained UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLA-AN significantly improves spatial grounding, scene reasoning, and long-horizon navigation, achieving a maximum single-task success rate of 98.1%, and providing an efficient, practical solution for realizing full-chain closed-loop autonomy in lightweight aerial robots.

Autonomous exploration is a fundamental capability that tightly integrates perception, planning, control, and motion execution. It plays a critical role in a wide range of applications, including indoor target search, mapping of extreme environments, resource exploration, etc. Despite significant progress in individual components, a holistic and practical description of a completely autonomous exploration system, encompassing both hardware and software, remains scarce. In this paper, we present GuangMing-Explorer, a fully integrated autonomous exploration platform designed for robust operation across diverse environments. We provide a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, including hardware design, software stack, algorithm deployment, and experimental configuration. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate the platform's effectiveness and efficiency in executing autonomous exploration tasks, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in complex and unstructured environments.

The adoption of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) for internal logistics is accelerating, with most solutions emphasizing decentralized, onboard intelligence. While AMRs in indoor environments like factories can be supported by infrastructure, involving external sensors and computational resources, such systems remain underexplored in the literature. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of infrastructure-based AMR systems, outlining key opportunities and challenges. To support this, we introduce a reference architecture combining infrastructure-based sensing, on-premise cloud computing, and onboard autonomy. Based on the architecture, we review core technologies for localization, perception, and planning. We demonstrate the approach in a real-world deployment in a heavy-vehicle manufacturing environment and summarize findings from a user experience (UX) evaluation. Our aim is to provide a holistic foundation for future development of scalable, robust, and human-compatible AMR systems in complex industrial environments.

Authors: Jörg Gamerdinger, Sven Teufel, Stephan Amann, Lukas Marc Listl, Oliver Bringmann

Extensive evaluation of perception systems is crucial for ensuring the safety of intelligent vehicles in complex driving scenarios. Conventional performance metrics such as precision, recall and the F1-score assess the overall detection accuracy, but they do not consider the safety-relevant aspects of perception. Consequently, perception systems that achieve high scores in these metrics may still cause misdetections that could lead to severe accidents. Therefore, it is important to evaluate not only the overall performance of perception systems, but also their safety. We therefore introduce a novel safety metric for jointly evaluating the most critical perception tasks, object and lane detection. Our proposed framework integrates a new, lightweight object safety metric that quantifies the potential risk associated with object detection errors, as well as an lane safety metric including the interdependence between both tasks that can occur in safety evaluation. The resulting combined safety score provides a unified, interpretable measure of perception safety performance. Using the DeepAccident dataset, we demonstrate that our approach identifies safety critical perception errors that conventional performance metrics fail to capture. Our findings emphasize the importance of safety-centric evaluation methods for perception systems in autonomous driving.

Authors: Evgenii Kruzhkov, Raphael Memmesheimer, Sven Behnke

Robust robot localization is an important prerequisite for navigation planning. If the environment map was created from different sensors, robot measurements must be robustly associated with map features. In this work, we extend Monte Carlo Localization using vision-language features. These open-vocabulary features enable to robustly compute the likelihood of visual observations, given a camera pose and a 3D map created from posed RGB-D images or aligned point clouds. The abstract vision-language features enable to associate observations and map elements from different modalities. Global localization can be initialized by natural language descriptions of the objects present in the vicinity of locations. We evaluate our approach using Matterport3D and Replica for indoor scenes and demonstrate generalization on SemanticKITTI for outdoor scenes.

### 9. [mimic-video: Video-Action Models for Generalizable Robot Control Beyond VLAs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15692v1)

Authors: Jonas Pai, Liam Achenbach, Victoriano Montesinos, Benedek Forrai, Oier Mees, Elvis Nava

Prevailing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) for robotic manipulation are built upon vision-language backbones pretrained on large-scale, but disconnected static web data. As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce \model, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures.

Authors: Giacomo Picardi, Saverio Iacoponi, Matias Carandell, Jorge Aguirregomezcorta, Mrudul Chellapurath, Joaquin del Rio, Marcello Calisti, Iacopo Aguzzi

Underwater robotics is becoming increasingly important for marine science, environmental monitoring, and subsea industrial operations, yet the development of underwater manipulation and actuation systems remains restricted by high costs, proprietary designs, and limited access to modular, research-oriented hardware. While open-source initiatives have democratized vehicle construction and control software, a substantial gap persists for joint-actuated systems-particularly those requiring waterproof, feedback-enabled actuation suitable for manipulators, grippers, and bioinspired devices. As a result, many research groups face lengthy development cycles, limited reproducibility, and difficulty transitioning laboratory prototypes to field-ready platforms.
  To address this gap, we introduce an open, cost-effective hardware and software toolkit for underwater manipulation research. The toolkit includes a depth-rated Underwater Robotic Joint (URJ) with early leakage detection, compact control and power management electronics, and a ROS2-based software stack for sensing and multi-mode actuation. All CAD models, fabrication files, PCB sources, firmware, and ROS2 packages are openly released, enabling local manufacturing, modification, and community-driven improvement.
  The toolkit has undergone extensive laboratory testing and multiple field deployments, demonstrating reliable operation up to 40 m depth across diverse applications, including a 3-DoF underwater manipulator, a tendon-driven soft gripper, and an underactuated sediment sampler. These results validate the robustness, versatility, and reusability of the toolkit for real marine environments.
  By providing a fully open, field-tested platform, this work aims to lower the barrier to entry for underwater manipulation research, improve reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in underwater field robotics.

### 1. [A High-level Synthesis Toolchain for the Julia Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15679v1)

Authors: Benedict Short, Ian McInerney, John Wickerson

With the push towards Exascale computing and data-driven methods, problem sizes have increased dramatically, increasing the computational requirements of the underlying algorithms. This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the "two-language problem": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications.

### 2. [On Assessing the Relevance of Code Reviews Authored by Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15466v1)

Authors: Robert Heumüller, Frank Ortmeier

The use of large language models like ChatGPT in code review offers promising efficiency gains but also raises concerns about correctness and safety. Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of "usefulness", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers. Going further, our proposed method motivates and enables more meaningful assessments of generative AI's performance in code review, while also raising awareness of potential risks of unchecked integration into review processes.

### 3. [A Container-based Approach For Proactive Asset Administration Shell Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15452v1)

Authors: Carsten Ellwein, Jingxi Zhang, Andreas Wortmann, Antony Ayman Alfy Meckhael

In manufacturing, digital twins, realized as Asset Administration Shells (AAS), have emerged as a prevalent practice. These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine. Our contribution enables the AAS to serve not only as a passive digital representation but also as an active interface for executing added-value services.%, thereby laying the foundation for future AI-driven adaptation and system-level intelligence in digital twin environments.

### 4. [Insecure Ingredients? Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15447v1)

Authors: Ben Swierzy, Marc Ohm, Michael Meier

Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.

### 5. [APT-ClaritySet: A Large-Scale, High-Fidelity Labeled Dataset for APT Malware with Alias Normalization and Graph-Based Deduplication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15039v1)

Authors: Zhenhao Yin, Hanbing Yan, Huishu Lu, Jing Xiong, Xiangyu Li, Rui Mei, Tianning Zang

Large-scale, standardized datasets for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) research are scarce, and inconsistent actor aliases and redundant samples hinder reproducibility. This paper presents APT-ClaritySet and its construction pipeline that normalizes threat actor aliases (reconciling approximately 11.22\% of inconsistent names) and applies graph-feature deduplication -- reducing the subset of statically analyzable executables by 47.55\% while retaining behaviorally distinct variants. APT-ClaritySet comprises: (i) APT-ClaritySet-Full, the complete pre-deduplication collection with 34{,}363 malware samples attributed to 305 APT groups (2006 - early 2025); (ii) APT-ClaritySet-Unique, the deduplicated release with 25{,}923 unique samples spanning 303 groups and standardized attributions; and (iii) APT-ClaritySet-FuncReuse, a function-level resource that includes 324{,}538 function-reuse clusters (FRCs) enabling measurement of inter-/intra-group sharing, evolution, and tooling lineage. By releasing these components and detailing the alias normalization and scalable deduplication pipeline, this work provides a high-fidelity, reproducible foundation for quantitative studies of APT patterns, evolution, and attribution.

### 6. [Toxicity Ahead: Forecasting Conversational Derailment on GitHub](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15031v1)

Authors: Mia Mohammad Imran, Robert Zita, Rahat Rizvi Rahman, Preetha Chatterjee, Kostadin Damevski

Toxic interactions in Open Source Software (OSS) communities reduce contributor engagement and threaten project sustainability. Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.
  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of structured LLM prompting for early detection of conversational derailment in OSS, enabling proactive and explainable moderation.

### 7. [SeBERTis: A Framework for Producing Classifiers of Security-Related Issue Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15003v1)

Authors: Sogol Masoumzadeh, Yufei Li, Shane McIntosh, Dániel Varró, Lili Wei

Monitoring issue tracker submissions is a crucial software maintenance activity. A key goal is the prioritization of high risk, security-related bugs. If such bugs can be recognized early, the risk of propagation to dependent products and endangerment of stakeholder benefits can be mitigated. To assist triage engineers with this task, several automatic detection techniques, from Machine Learning (ML) models to prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), have been proposed. Although promising to some extent, prior techniques often memorize lexical cues as decision shortcuts, yielding low detection rate specifically for more complex submissions. As such, these classifiers do not yet reach the practical expectations of a real-time detector of security-related issues. To address these limitations, we propose SEBERTIS, a framework to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as classifiers independent of lexical cues, so that they can confidently detect fully unseen security-related issues. SEBERTIS capitalizes on fine-tuning bidirectional transformer architectures as Masked Language Models (MLMs) on a series of semantically equivalent vocabulary to prediction labels (which we call Semantic Surrogates) when they have been replaced with a mask. Our SEBERTIS-trained classifier achieves a 0.9880 F1-score in detecting security-related issues of a curated corpus of 10,000 GitHub issue reports, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art issue classifiers, with 14.44%-96.98%, 15.40%-93.07%, and 14.90%-94.72% higher detection precision, recall, and F1-score over ML-based baselines. Our classifier also substantially surpasses LLM baselines, with an improvement of 23.20%-63.71%, 36.68%-85.63%, and 39.49%-74.53% for precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 8. [Aligning Academia with Industry: An Empirical Study of Industrial Needs and Academic Capabilities in AI-Driven Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15148v1)

Authors: Hang Yu, Yuzhou Lai, Li Zhang, Xiaoli Lian, Fang Liu, Yanrui Dong, Ting Zhang, Zhi Jin, David Lo

The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally reshaping software engineering (SE), driving a paradigm shift in both academic research and industrial practice. While top-tier SE venues continue to show sustained or emerging focus on areas like automated testing and program repair, with researchers worldwide reporting continuous performance gains, the alignment of these academic advances with real industrial needs remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 1,367 papers published in FSE, ASE, and ICSE between 2022 and 2025, identifying key research topics, commonly used benchmarks, industrial relevance, and open-source availability. We then carry out an empirical survey across 17 organizations, collecting 282 responses on six prominent topics, i.e., program analysis, automated testing, code generation/completion, issue resolution, pre-trained code models, and dependency management, through structured questionnaires. By contrasting academic capabilities with industrial feedback, we derive seven critical implications, highlighting under-addressed challenges in software requirements and architecture, the reliability and explainability of intelligent SE approaches, input assumptions in academic research, practical evaluation tensions, and ethical considerations. This study aims to refocus academic attention on these important yet under-explored problems and to guide future SE research toward greater industrial impact.

### 9. [An Exploratory Study of Bayesian Prompt Optimization for Test-Driven Code Generation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15076v1)

Authors: Shlok Tomar, Aryan Deshwal, Ethan Villalovoz, Mattia Fazzini, Haipeng Cai, Janardhan Rao Doppa

We consider the task of generating functionally correct code using large language models (LLMs). The correctness of generated code is influenced by the prompt used to query the given base LLM. We formulate the problem of finding the appropriate prompt as combinatorial search process and propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach referred to as {\em BO for Code GENeration (BODE-GEN)}. BODE-GEN performs an adaptive data-driven search over prompts guided by training data in the form of prompts tried and the functional accuracy of the generated code over a set of given test cases. The key insight is to perform BO in continuous embedding space by using an auxiliary LLM to bridge the gap between discrete prompt space and continuous embedding space. We leverage two synergistic ideas, namely, random projections and dimensionality scaled priors, to build effective Gaussian process based surrogate models over the high-dimensional embedding space. Our experiments on the HumanEval+ benchmark using multiple base LLMs show that BODE-GEN can improve performance in terms of code generation accuracy compared to fixed prompts and manual prompt engineering. Additionally, we demonstrate that BODE-GEN is sample-efficient, requiring relatively few iterations of BO to demonstrate improvements in code accuracy.

### 10. [Imitation Game: Reproducing Deep Learning Bugs Leveraging an Intelligent Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14990v1)

Authors: Mehil B Shah, Mohammad Masudur Rahman, Foutse Khomh

Despite their wide adoption in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, software engineering), Deep Learning (DL)-based applications suffer from many bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities. Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.

Authors: Liang Peng, Yixuan Ye, Cheng Liu, Hangjun Che, Man-Fai Leung, Si Wu, Hau-San Wong

Recently, neighbor-based contrastive learning has been introduced to effectively exploit neighborhood information for clustering. However, these methods rely on the homophily assumption-that connected nodes share similar class labels and should therefore be close in feature space-which fails to account for the varying homophily levels in real-world graphs. As a result, applying contrastive learning to low-homophily graphs may lead to indistinguishable node representations due to unreliable neighborhood information, making it challenging to identify trustworthy neighborhoods with varying homophily levels in graph clustering. To tackle this, we introduce a novel neighborhood Neutral Contrastive Graph Clustering method, NeuCGC, that extends traditional contrastive learning by incorporating neutral pairs-node pairs treated as weighted positive pairs, rather than strictly positive or negative. These neutral pairs are dynamically adjusted based on the graph's homophily level, enabling a more flexible and robust learning process. Leveraging neutral pairs in contrastive learning, our method incorporates two key components: (1) an adaptive contrastive neighborhood distribution alignment that adjusts based on the homophily level of the given attribute graph, ensuring effective alignment of neighborhood distributions, and (2) a contrastive neighborhood node feature consistency learning mechanism that leverages reliable neighborhood information from high-confidence graphs to learn robust node representations, mitigating the adverse effects of varying homophily levels and effectively exploiting highly trustworthy neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, outperforming other state-of-the-art graph clustering methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/THPengL/NeuCGC.

### 2. [Model inference for ranking from pairwise comparisons](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15269v1)

Authors: Daniel Sánchez Catalina, George T. Cantwell

We consider the problem of ranking objects from noisy pairwise comparisons, for example, ranking tennis players from the outcomes of matches. We follow a standard approach to this problem and assume that each object has an unobserved strength and that the outcome of each comparison depends probabilistically on the strengths of the comparands. However, we do not assume to know a priori how skills affect outcomes. Instead, we present an efficient algorithm for simultaneously inferring both the unobserved strengths and the function that maps strengths to probabilities. Despite this problem being under-constrained, we present experimental evidence that the conclusions of our Bayesian approach are robust to different model specifications. We include several case studies to exemplify the method on real-world data sets.

Authors: Victor Léger, Florent Chatelain

Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a widely used method for data integration, designed to extract latent components shared across paired high-dimensional datasets. Despite decades of practical success, a precise theoretical understanding of its behavior in high-dimensional regimes remains limited. In this paper, we study a data integration model in which two high-dimensional data matrices share a low-rank common latent structure while also containing individual-specific components. We analyze the singular vectors of the associated cross-covariance matrix using tools from random matrix theory and derive asymptotic characterizations of the alignment between estimated and true latent directions. These results provide a quantitative explanation of the reconstruction performance of the PLS variant based on Singular Value Decomposition (PLS-SVD) and identify regimes where the method exhibits counter-intuitive or limiting behavior. Building on this analysis, we compare PLS-SVD with principal component analysis applied separately to each dataset and show its asymptotic superiority in detecting the common latent subspace. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive theoretical understanding of high-dimensional PLS-SVD, clarifying both its advantages and fundamental limitations.

### 2. [A Teacher-Student Perspective on the Dynamics of Learning Near the Optimal Point](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15606v1)

Authors: Carlos Couto, José Mourão, Mário A. T. Figueiredo, Pedro Ribeiro

Near an optimal learning point of a neural network, the learning performance of gradient descent dynamics is dictated by the Hessian matrix of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. We characterize the Hessian eigenspectrum for some classes of teacher-student problems, when the teacher and student networks have matching weights, showing that the smaller eigenvalues of the Hessian determine long-time learning performance. For linear networks, we analytically establish that for large networks the spectrum asymptotically follows a convolution of a scaled chi-square distribution with a scaled Marchenko-Pastur distribution. We numerically analyse the Hessian spectrum for polynomial and other non-linear networks. Furthermore, we show that the rank of the Hessian matrix can be seen as an effective number of parameters for networks using polynomial activation functions. For a generic non-linear activation function, such as the error function, we empirically observe that the Hessian matrix is always full rank.

### 3. [Interpretable Multivariate Conformal Prediction with Fast Transductive Standardization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15383v1)

Authors: Yunjie Fan, Matteo Sesia

We propose a conformal prediction method for constructing tight simultaneous prediction intervals for multiple, potentially related, numerical outputs given a single input. This method can be combined with any multi-target regression model and guarantees finite-sample coverage. It is computationally efficient and yields informative prediction intervals even with limited data. The core idea is a novel \emph{coordinate-wise} standardization procedure that makes residuals across output dimensions directly comparable, estimating suitable scaling parameters using the calibration data themselves. This does not require modeling of cross-output dependence nor auxiliary sample splitting. Implementing this idea requires overcoming technical challenges associated with transductive or full conformal prediction. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate this method can produce tighter prediction intervals than existing baselines while maintaining valid simultaneous coverage.

### 4. [Soft Geometric Inductive Bias for Object Centric Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15493v1)

Authors: Hampus Linander, Conor Heins, Alexander Tschantz, Marco Perin, Christopher Buckley

Equivariance is a powerful prior for learning physical dynamics, yet exact group equivariance can degrade performance if the symmetries are broken. We propose object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, providing a soft geometric inductive bias. Our models are evaluated using simulated environments of 2d rigid body dynamics with static obstacles, where we train for next-step predictions autoregressively. For long-horizon rollouts we show that the soft inductive bias of our models results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant baseline models. The approach complements recent soft-equivariance ideas and aligns with the view that simple, well-chosen priors can yield robust generalization. These results suggest that geometric algebra offers an effective middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, delivering sample-efficient dynamics models for multi-object scenes.

### 5. [Prospects for quantum advantage in machine learning from the representability of functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15661v1)

Authors: Sergi Masot-Llima, Elies Gil-Fuster, Carlos Bravo-Prieto, Jens Eisert, and Tommaso Guaita

Demonstrating quantum advantage in machine learning tasks requires navigating a complex landscape of proposed models and algorithms. To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie.

### 6. [A Regime-Aware Fusion Framework for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15378v1)

Authors: Honey Singh Chauhan, Zahraa S. Abdallah

Kernel-based methods such as Rocket are among the most effective default approaches for univariate time series classification (TSC), yet they do not perform equally well across all datasets. We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it.

### 7. [Fully Bayesian Spectral Clustering and Benchmarking with Uncertainty Quantification for Small Area Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15643v1)

Authors: Jairo Fúquene-Patiño

In this work, inspired by machine learning techniques, we propose a new Bayesian model for Small Area Estimation (SAE), the Fay-Herriot model with Spectral Clustering (FH-SC). Unlike traditional approaches, clustering in FH-SC is based on spectral clustering algorithms that utilize external covariates, rather than geographical or administrative criteria. A major advantage of the FH-SC model is its flexibility in integrating existing SAE approaches, with or without clustering random effects. To enable benchmarking, we leverage the theoretical framework of posterior projections for constrained Bayesian inference and derive closed form expressions for the new Rao-Blackwell (RB) estimators of the posterior mean under the FH-SC model. Additionally, we introduce a novel measure of uncertainty for the benchmarked estimator, the Conditional Posterior Mean Square Error (CPMSE), which is generalizable to other Bayesian SAE estimators. We conduct model-based and data-based simulation studies to evaluate the frequentist properties of the CPMSE. The proposed methodology is motivated by a real case study involving the estimation of the proportion of households with internet access in the municipalities of Colombia. Finally, we also illustrate the advantages of FH-SC over existing Bayesian and frequentist approaches through our case study.

### 8. [Online Partitioned Local Depth for semi-supervised applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15436v1)

Authors: John D. Foley, Justin T. Lee

We introduce an extension of the partitioned local depth (PaLD) algorithm that is adapted to online applications such as semi-supervised prediction. The new algorithm we present, online PaLD, is well-suited to situations where it is a possible to pre-compute a cohesion network from a reference dataset. After $O(n^3)$ steps to construct a queryable data structure, online PaLD can extend the cohesion network to a new data point in $O(n^2)$ time. Our approach complements previous speed up approaches based on approximation and parallelism. For illustrations, we present applications to online anomaly detection and semi-supervised classification for health-care datasets.

### 9. [Autoregressive Language Models are Secretly Energy-Based Models: Insights into the Lookahead Capabilities of Next-Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15605v1)

Authors: Mathieu Blondel, Michael E. Sander, Germain Vivier-Ardisson, Tianlin Liu, Vincent Roulet

Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently constitute the dominant paradigm for large language models (LLMs). Energy-based models (EBMs) represent another class of models, which have historically been less prevalent in LLM development, yet naturally characterize the optimal policy in post-training alignment. In this paper, we provide a unified view of these two model classes. Taking the chain rule of probability as a starting point, we establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, which we show to correspond to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Building upon this bijection, we derive the equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs. Furthermore, we analyze the distillation of EBMs into ARMs by providing theoretical error bounds. Our results provide insights into the ability of ARMs to plan ahead, despite being based on the next-token prediction paradigm.

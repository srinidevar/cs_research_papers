### 1. [Decision-Aware Trust Signal Alignment for SOC Alert Triage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04486v1)

Authors: Israt Jahan Chowdhury, Md Abu Yousuf Tanvir

Detection systems that utilize machine learning are progressively implemented at Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to help an analyst to filter through high volumes of security alerts. Practically, such systems tend to reveal probabilistic results or confidence scores which are ill-calibrated and hard to read when under pressure. Qualitative and survey based studies of SOC practice done before reveal that poor alert quality and alert overload greatly augment the burden on the analyst, especially when tool outputs are not coherent with decision requirements, or signal noise. One of the most significant limitations is that model confidence is usually shown without expressing that there are asymmetric costs in decision making where false alarms are much less harmful than missed attacks. The present paper presents a decision-sensitive trust signal correspondence scheme of SOC alert triage. The framework combines confidence that has been calibrated, lightweight uncertainty cues, and cost-sensitive decision thresholds into coherent decision-support layer, instead of making changes to detection models. To enhance probabilistic consistency, the calibration is done using the known post-hoc methods and the uncertainty cues give conservative protection in situations where model certainty is low. To measure the model-independent performance of the suggested model, we apply the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifiers to the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection benchmark. According to simulation findings, false negatives are greatly amplified by the presence of misaligned displays of confidence, whereas cost weighted loss decreases by orders of magnitude between models with decision aligned trust signals. Lastly, we describe a human-in-the-loop study plan that would allow empirically assessing the decision-making of the analysts with aligned and misaligned trust interfaces.

### 2. [ThinkDrive: Chain-of-Thought Guided Progressive Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04714v1)

Authors: Chang Zhao, Zheming Yang, Yunqing Hu, Qi Guo, Zijian Wang, Pengcheng Li, Wen Ji

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) technologies, their application in the domain of autonomous driving has become increasingly widespread. However, existing methods suffer from unstructured reasoning, poor generalization, and misalignment with human driving intent. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances decision transparency, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fails to fully exploit its potential, and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches face instability and suboptimal reasoning depth. We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations. Then, we apply progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset. The results show that ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy, respectively. Moreover, a 2B-parameter model trained with our method surpasses the much larger GPT-4o by 3.28% on the exam metric.

### 3. [TourPlanner: A Competitive Consensus Framework with Constraint-Gated Reinforcement Learning for Travel Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04698v1)

Authors: Yinuo Wang, Mining Tan, Wenxiang Jiao, Xiaoxi Li, Hao Wang, Xuanyu Zhang, Yuan Lu, Weiming Dong

Travel planning is a sophisticated decision-making process that requires synthesizing multifaceted information to construct itineraries. However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met. Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks demonstrate that TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment.

### 4. [A Method for Constructing a Digital Transformation Driving Mechanism Based on Semantic Understanding of Large Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04696v1)

Authors: Huayi Liu

In the process of digital transformation, enterprises are faced with problems such as insufficient semantic understanding of unstructured data and lack of intelligent decision-making basis in driving mechanisms. This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.

### 5. [ResMAS: Resilience Optimization in LLM-based Multi-agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04694v1)

Authors: Zhilun Zhou, Zihan Liu, Jiahe Liu, Qingyu Shao, Yihan Wang, Kun Shao, Depeng Jin, Fengli Xu

Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-based MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to solve complex tasks, have shown impressive performance in many areas. However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.

### 6. [Estimating Causal Effects in Gaussian Linear SCMs with Finite Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04673v1)

Authors: Aurghya Maiti, Prateek Jain

Estimating causal effects from observational data remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference, especially in the presence of latent confounders. This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.

### 7. [Vibe Coding an LLM-powered Theorem Prover](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04653v1)

Authors: Zhe Hou

We present Isabellm, an LLM-powered theorem prover for Isabelle/HOL that performs fully automatic proof synthesis. Isabellm works with any local LLM on Ollama and APIs such as Gemini CLI, and it is designed to run on consumer grade computers. The system combines a stepwise prover, which uses large language models to propose proof commands validated by Isabelle in a bounded search loop, with a higher-level proof planner that generates structured Isar outlines and attempts to fill and repair remaining gaps. The framework includes beam search for tactics, tactics reranker ML and RL models, premise selection with small transformer models, micro-RAG for Isar proofs built from AFP, and counter-example guided proof repair. All the code is implemented by GPT 4.1 - 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5. Empirically, Isabellm can prove certain lemmas that defeat Isabelle's standard automation, including Sledgehammer, demonstrating the practical value of LLM-guided proof search. At the same time, we find that even state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT 5.2 Extended Thinking and Gemini 3 Pro struggle to reliably implement the intended fill-and-repair mechanisms with complex algorithmic designs, highlighting fundamental challenges in LLM code generation and reasoning. The code of Isabellm is available at https://github.com/zhehou/llm-isabelle

### 8. [SpeechMedAssist: Efficiently and Effectively Adapting Speech Language Models for Medical Consultation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04638v1)

Authors: Sirry Chen, Jieyi Wang, Wei Chen, Zhongyu Wei

Medical consultations are intrinsically speech-centric. However, most prior works focus on long-text-based interactions, which are cumbersome and patient-unfriendly. Recent advances in speech language models (SpeechLMs) have enabled more natural speech-based interaction, yet the scarcity of medical speech data and the inefficiency of directly fine-tuning on speech data jointly hinder the adoption of SpeechLMs in medical consultation. In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all baselines in both effectiveness and robustness in most evaluation settings.

### 9. [From National Curricula to Cultural Awareness: Constructing Open-Ended Culture-Specific Question Answering Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04632v1)

Authors: Haneul Yoo, Won Ik Cho, Geunhye Kim, Jiyoon Han

Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on many tasks, but their progress remains uneven across languages and cultures, often reflecting values latent in English-centric training data. To enable practical cultural alignment, we propose a scalable approach that leverages national social studies curricula as a foundation for culture-aware supervision. We introduce CuCu, an automated multi-agent LLM framework that transforms national textbook curricula into open-ended, culture-specific question-answer pairs. Applying CuCu to the Korean national social studies curriculum, we construct KCaQA, comprising 34.1k open-ended QA pairs. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that KCaQA covers culture-specific topics and produces responses grounded in local sociocultural contexts.

### 10. [DeepHalo: A Neural Choice Model with Controllable Context Effects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04616v1)

Authors: Shuhan Zhang, Zhi Wang, Rui Gao, Shuang Li

Modeling human decision-making is central to applications such as recommendation, preference learning, and human-AI alignment. While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance while providing greater transparency into the drivers of choice.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [Memory-Guided Unified Hardware Accelerator for Mixed-Precision Scientific Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04476v1)

Authors: Chuanzhen Wang, Leo Zhang, Eric Liu

Recent hardware acceleration advances have enabled powerful specialized accelerators for finite element computations, spiking neural network inference, and sparse tensor operations. However, existing approaches face fundamental limitations: (1) finite element methods lack comprehensive rounding error analysis for reduced-precision implementations and use fixed precision assignment strategies that cannot adapt to varying numerical conditioning; (2) spiking neural network accelerators cannot handle non-spike operations and suffer from bit-width escalation as network depth increases; and (3) FPGA tensor accelerators optimize only for dense computations while requiring manual configuration for each sparsity pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Memory-Guided Unified Hardware Accelerator for Mixed-Precision Scientific Computing}, a novel framework that integrates three enhanced modules with memory-guided adaptation for efficient mixed-workload processing on unified platforms. Our approach employs memory-guided precision selection to overcome fixed precision limitations, integrates experience-driven bit-width management and dynamic parallelism adaptation for enhanced spiking neural network acceleration, and introduces curriculum learning for automatic sparsity pattern discovery. Extensive experiments on FEniCS, COMSOL, ANSYS benchmarks, MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-Gesture datasets, and COCO 2017 demonstrate 2.8\% improvement in numerical accuracy, 47\% throughput increase, 34\% energy reduction, and 45-65\% throughput improvement compared to specialized accelerators. Our work enables unified processing of finite element methods, spiking neural networks, and sparse computations on a single platform while eliminating data transfer overhead between separate units.

### 2. [MPM-LLM4DSE: Reaching the Pareto Frontier in HLS with Multimodal Learning and LLM-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04801v1)

Authors: Lei Xu, Shanshan Wang, Chenglong Xiao

High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) seeks Pareto-optimal designs within expansive pragma configuration spaces. To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal predictive model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art work ProgSG by up to 10.25$\times$. Furthermore, in DSE tasks, the proposed LLM4DSE achieves an average performance gain of 39.90\% over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of our prompting methodology. Code and models are available at https://github.com/wslcccc/MPM-LLM4DSE.

### 3. [Challenges and Research Directions for Large Language Model Inference Hardware](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05047v1)

Authors: Xiaoyu Ma, David Patterson

Large Language Model (LLM) inference is hard. The autoregressive Decode phase of the underlying Transformer model makes LLM inference fundamentally different from training. Exacerbated by recent AI trends, the primary challenges are memory and interconnect rather than compute. To address these challenges, we highlight four architecture research opportunities: High Bandwidth Flash for 10X memory capacity with HBM-like bandwidth; Processing-Near-Memory and 3D memory-logic stacking for high memory bandwidth; and low-latency interconnect to speedup communication. While our focus is datacenter AI, we also review their applicability for mobile devices.

### 4. [Supporting Secured Integration of Microarchitectural Defenses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05057v1)

Authors: Kartik Ramkrishnan, Stephen McCamant, Antonia Zhai, Pen-Chung Yew

There has been a plethora of microarchitectural-level attacks leading to many proposed countermeasures. This has created an unexpected and unaddressed security issue where naive integration of those defenses can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. This occurs when one defense changes an aspect of a microarchitecture that is crucial for the security of another defense. We refer to this problem as a microarchitectural defense assumption violation} (MDAV).
  We propose a two-step methodology to screen for potential MDAVs in the early-stage of integration. The first step is to design and integrate a composed model, guided by bounded model checking of security properties. The second step is to implement the model concretely on a simulator and to evaluate with simulated attacks. As a contribution supporting the first step, we propose an event-based modeling framework, called Maestro, for testing and evaluating microarchitectural models with integrated defenses. In our evaluation, Maestro reveals MDAVs (8), supports compact expression (~15x Alloy LoC ratio), enables semantic composability and eliminates performance degradations (>100x).
  As a contribution supporting the second step, we use an event-based simulator (GEM5) for investigating integrated microarchitectural defenses. We show that a covert channel attack is possible on a naively integrated implementation of some state-of-the-art defenses, and a repaired implementation using our integration methodology is resilient to the attack.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [Efficient Compression in Semigroups](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04747v1)

Authors: Alexander Thumm, Armin Weiß

Straight-line programs are a central tool in several areas of computer science, including data compression, algebraic complexity theory, and the algorithmic solution of algebraic equations. In the algebraic setting, where straight-line programs can be interpreted as circuits over algebraic structures such as semigroups or groups, they have led to deep insights in computational complexity.
  A key result by Babai and Szemerédi (1984) showed that finite groups afford efficient compression via straight-line programs, enabling the design of a black-box computation model for groups. Building on their result, Fleischer (2019) placed the Cayley table membership problem for certain classes (pseudovarieties) of finite semigroups in NPOLYLOGTIME, and in some cases even in FOLL. He also provided a complete classification of pseudovarieties of finite monoids affording efficient compression.
  In this work, we complete this classification program initiated by Fleischer, characterizing precisely those pseudovarieties of finite semigroups that afford efficient compression via straight-line programs. Along the way, we also improve several known bounds on the length and width of straight-line programs over semigroups, monoids, and groups. These results lead to new upper bounds for the membership problem in the Cayley table model: for all pseudovarieties that afford efficient compression and do not contain any nonsolvable group, we obtain FOLL algorithms. In particular, we resolve a conjecture of Barrington, Kadau, Lange, and McKenzie (2001), showing that the membership problem for all solvable groups is in FOLL.

### 2. [An Invitation to "Fine-grained Complexity of NP-Complete Problems"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05044v1)

Authors: Jesper Nederlof

Assuming that P is not equal to NP, the worst-case run time of any algorithm solving an NP-complete problem must be super-polynomial. But what is the fastest run time we can get? Before one can even hope to approach this question, a more provocative question presents itself: Since for many problems the naive brute-force baseline algorithms are still the fastest ones, maybe their run times are already optimal?
  The area that we call in this survey "fine-grained complexity of NP-complete problems" studies exactly this question. We invite the reader to catch up on selected classic results as well as delve into exciting recent developments in a riveting tour through the area passing by (among others) algebra, complexity theory, extremal and additive combinatorics, cryptography, and, of course, last but not least, algorithm design.

### Computational Engineering

### 1. [MMFCTUB: Multi-Modal Financial Credit Table Understanding Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04643v1)

Authors: Cui Yakun, Yanting Zhang, Zhu Lei, Jian Xie, Zhizhuo Kou, Hang Du, Zhenghao Zhu, Sirui Han

The advent of multi-modal language models (MLLMs) has spurred research into their application across various table understanding tasks. However, their performance in credit table understanding (CTU) for financial credit review remains largely unexplored due to the following barriers: low data consistency, high annotation costs stemming from domain-specific knowledge and complex calculations, and evaluation paradigm gaps between benchmark and real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce MMFCTUB (Multi-Modal Financial Credit Table Understanding Benchmark), a practical benchmark, encompassing more than 7,600 high quality CTU samples across 5 table types. MMFCTUB employ a minimally supervised pipeline that adheres to inter-table constraints and maintains data distributions consistency. The benchmark leverages capacity-driven questions and mask-and-recovery strategy to evaluate models' cross-table structure perception, domain knowledge utilization, and numerical calculation capabilities. Utilizing MMFCTUB, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of both proprietary and open-source MLLMs, revealing their strengths and limitations in CTU tasks. MMFCTUB serves as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating rigorous evaluation of MLLMs in the domain of CTU.

### 2. [Towards Spatio-Temporal Extrapolation of Phase-Field Simulations with Convolution-Only Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04510v1)

Authors: Christophe Bonneville, Nathan Bieberdorf, Pieterjan Robbe, Mark Asta, Habib Najm, Laurent Capolungo, Cosmin Safta

Phase-field simulations of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can capture complex microstructural evolutions but can be prohibitively expensive for large domains and long time horizons. In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds. This work is a first stepping stone towards high-fidelity extrapolation in both space and time of phase-field simulation for LMD.

### 3. [Industrial Data-Service-Knowledge Governance: Toward Integrated and Trusted Intelligence for Industry 5.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04569v1)

Authors: Hailiang Zhao, Ziqi Wang, Daojiang Hu, Zhiwei Ling, Wenzhuo Qian, Jiahui Zhai, Yuhao Yang, Zhipeng Gao, Mingyi Liu, Kai Di, Xinkui Zhao, Zhongjie Wang, Jianwei Yin, MengChu Zhou, Shuiguang Deng

The convergence of artificial intelligence, cyber-physical systems, and cross-enterprise data ecosystems has propelled industrial intelligence to unprecedented scales. Yet, the absence of a unified trust foundation across data, services, and knowledge layers undermines reliability, accountability, and regulatory compliance in real-world deployments. While existing surveys address isolated aspects, such as data governance, service orchestration, and knowledge representation, none provides a holistic, cross-layer perspective on trustworthiness tailored to industrial settings. To bridge this gap, we present \textsc{Trisk} (TRusted Industrial Data-Service-Knowledge governance), a novel conceptual and taxonomic framework for trustworthy industrial intelligence. Grounded in a five-dimensional trust model (quality, security, privacy, fairness, and explainability), \textsc{Trisk} unifies 120+ representative studies along three orthogonal axes: governance scope (data, service, and knowledge), architectural paradigm (centralized, federated, or edge-embedded), and enabling technology (knowledge graphs, zero-trust policies, causal inference, etc.). We systematically analyze how trust propagates across digital layers, identify critical gaps in semantic interoperability, runtime policy enforcement, and operational/information technologies alignment, and evaluate the maturity of current industrial implementations. Finally, we articulate a forward-looking research agenda for Industry 5.0, advocating for an integrated governance fabric that embeds verifiable trust semantics into every layer of the industrial intelligence stack. This survey serves as both a foundational reference for researchers and a practical roadmap for engineers to deploy trustworthy AI in complex and multi-stakeholder environments.

### 4. [A Semi-supervised Molecular Learning Framework for Activity Cliff Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04507v1)

Authors: Fang Wu

Machine learning (ML) enables accurate and fast molecular property predictions, which are of interest in drug discovery and material design. Their success is based on the principle of similarity at its heart, assuming that similar molecules exhibit close properties. However, activity cliffs challenge this principle, and their presence leads to a sharp decline in the performance of existing ML algorithms, particularly graph-based methods. To overcome this obstacle under a low-data scenario, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) method dubbed SemiMol, which employs predictions on numerous unannotated data as pseudo-signals for subsequent training. Specifically, we introduce an additional instructor model to evaluate the accuracy and trustworthiness of proxy labels because existing pseudo-labeling approaches require probabilistic outputs to reveal the model's confidence and fail to be applied in regression tasks. Moreover, we design a self-adaptive curriculum learning algorithm to progressively move the target model toward hard samples at a controllable pace. Extensive experiments on 30 activity cliff datasets demonstrate that SemiMol significantly enhances graph-based ML architectures and outpasses state-of-the-art pretraining and SSL baselines.

### 5. [Surface-based Molecular Design with Multi-modal Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04506v1)

Authors: Fang Wu, Zhengyuan Zhou, Shuting Jin, Xiangxiang Zeng, Jure Leskovec, Jinbo Xu

Therapeutic peptides show promise in targeting previously undruggable binding sites, with recent advancements in deep generative models enabling full-atom peptide co-design for specific protein receptors. However, the critical role of molecular surfaces in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has been underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an omni-design peptides generation paradigm, called SurfFlow, a novel surface-based generative algorithm that enables comprehensive co-design of sequence, structure, and surface for peptides. SurfFlow employs a multi-modality conditional flow matching (CFM) architecture to learn distributions of surface geometries and biochemical properties, enhancing peptide binding accuracy. Evaluated on the comprehensive PepMerge benchmark, SurfFlow consistently outperforms full-atom baselines across all metrics. These results highlight the advantages of considering molecular surfaces in de novo peptide discovery and demonstrate the potential of integrating multiple protein modalities for more effective therapeutic peptide discovery.

### 6. [Global Inequalities in Clinical Trials Participation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04660v1)

Authors: Wen Lou, Adrián A. Díaz-Faes, Jiangen He, Zhihao Liu, Vincent Larivière

Clinical trials shape medical evidence and determine who gains access to experimental therapies. Whether participation in these trials reflects the global burden of disease remains unclear. Here we analyze participation inequality across more than 62,000 randomized controlled trials spanning 16 major disease categories from 2000 to 2024. Linking 36.8 million trial participants to country-level disease burden, we show that global inequality in clinical trial participation is overwhelmingly structured by country rather than disease. Country-level factors explain over 90% of variation in participation, whereas disease-specific effects contribute only marginally. Removing entire disease categories, including those traditionally considered underfunded, has little effect on overall inequality. Instead, participation is highly concentrated geographically, with a small group of countries enrolling a disproportionate share of participants across nearly all diseases. These patterns have persisted despite decades of disease-targeted funding and increasing alignment between research attention and disease burden within diseases. Our findings indicate that disease-vertical strategies alone cannot correct participation inequality. Reducing global inequities in clinical research requires horizontal investments in research capacity, health infrastructure, and governance that operate across disease domains.

### 7. [Zoomy: flexible modeling and simulation software for free-surface flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04826v1)

Authors: Ingo Steldermann, Julia Kowalski

Free-surface flow is relevant to many researchers in water resources engineering, geohazard assessment, as well as coastal and river engineering. Many different free-surface models have been proposed, which span modeling complexity from the hydrostatic Saint-Venant equations to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Particularly efficient methods can be derived by depth-averaging, resulting in dimensionally reduced models. Typically, this yields hierarchies of models -- models with a variable system structure depending on the polynomial expansion of the flow variables -- that need to be analyzed and numerically solved.
  This description, analysis, and simulation are challenging, and existing software solutions only cover a specific subset of models generated by these hierarchies. We propose a new software framework to address this issue. Zoomy allows for an efficient description, symbolic analysis, and numerical solution of depth-averaged hierarchies of free-surface flow models. Zoomy handles a numerical discretization in one- and two-dimensional space on unstructured grids.
  With this framework, systematic evaluation of hierarchies of depth-averaged free-surface flows becomes feasible. Additionally, our open-source framework increases the accessibility of these depth-averaged systems to application engineers interested in efficient methods for free-surface flows.

### 1. [Using Ray-shooting Queries for Sublinear Algorithms for Dominating Sets in RDV Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04626v1)

Authors: Therese Biedl, Prashant Gokhale

In this paper, we study the dominating set problem in \emph{RDV graphs}, a graph class that lies between interval graphs and chordal graphs and is defined as the \textbf{v}ertex-intersection graphs of \textbf{d}ownward paths in a \textbf{r}ooted tree. It was shown in a previous paper that adjacency queries in an RDV graph can be reduced to the question whether a horizontal segment intersects a vertical segment. This was then used to find a maximum matching in an $n$-vertex RDV graph, using priority search trees, in $O(n\log n)$ time, i.e., without even looking at all edges. In this paper, we show that if additionally we also use a ray shooting data structure, we can also find a minimum dominating set in an RDV graph $O(n\log n)$ time (presuming a linear-sized representation of the graph is given). The same idea can also be used for a new proof to find a minimum dominating set in an interval graph in $O(n)$ time.

### 1. [Automatic Classifiers Underdetect Emotions Expressed by Men](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04730v1)

Authors: Ivan Smirnov, Segun T. Aroyehun, Paul Plener, David Garcia

The widespread adoption of automatic sentiment and emotion classifiers makes it important to ensure that these tools perform reliably across different populations. Yet their reliability is typically assessed using benchmarks that rely on third-party annotators rather than the individuals experiencing the emotions themselves, potentially concealing systematic biases. In this paper, we use a unique, large-scale dataset of more than one million self-annotated posts and a pre-registered research design to investigate gender biases in emotion detection across 414 combinations of models and emotion-related classes. We find that across different types of automatic classifiers and various underlying emotions, error rates are consistently higher for texts authored by men compared to those authored by women. We quantify how this bias could affect results in downstream applications and show that current machine learning tools, including large language models, should be applied with caution when the gender composition of a sample is not known or variable. Our findings demonstrate that sentiment analysis is not yet a solved problem, especially in ensuring equitable model behaviour across demographic groups.

Authors: Yinuo Wang, Mining Tan, Wenxiang Jiao, Xiaoxi Li, Hao Wang, Xuanyu Zhang, Yuan Lu, Weiming Dong

Travel planning is a sophisticated decision-making process that requires synthesizing multifaceted information to construct itineraries. However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met. Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks demonstrate that TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment.

### 3. [A Method for Constructing a Digital Transformation Driving Mechanism Based on Semantic Understanding of Large Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04696v1)

Authors: Huayi Liu

In the process of digital transformation, enterprises are faced with problems such as insufficient semantic understanding of unstructured data and lack of intelligent decision-making basis in driving mechanisms. This study proposes a method that combines a large language model (LLM) and a knowledge graph. First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.

Authors: Wentao Zhang, Lifei Wang, Lina Lu, MingKun Xu, Shangyang Li, Yanchao Yang, Tao Fang

Agricultural disease diagnosis challenges VLMs, as conventional fine-tuning requires extensive labels, lacks interpretability, and generalizes poorly. While reasoning improves model robustness, existing methods rely on costly expert annotations and rarely address the open-ended, diverse nature of agricultural queries. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Agri-R1}, a reasoning-enhanced large model for agriculture. Our framework automates high-quality reasoning data generation via vision-language synthesis and LLM-based filtering, using only 19\% of available samples. Training employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel proposed reward function that integrates domain-specific lexicons and fuzzy matching to assess both correctness and linguistic flexibility in open-ended responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, our resulting 3B-parameter model achieves performance competitive with 7B- to 13B-parameter baselines, showing a +23.2\% relative gain in disease recognition accuracy, +33.3\% in agricultural knowledge QA, and a +26.10-point improvement in cross-domain generalization over standard fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy between structured reasoning data and GRPO-driven exploration underpins these gains, with benefits scaling as question complexity increases.

### 5. [DP-MGTD: Privacy-Preserving Machine-Generated Text Detection via Adaptive Differentially Private Entity Sanitization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04641v1)

Authors: Lionel Z. Wang, Yusheng Zhao, Jiabin Luo, Xinfeng Li, Lixu Wang, Yinan Peng, Haoyang Li, XiaoFeng Wang, Wei Dong

The deployment of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) detection systems necessitates processing sensitive user data, creating a fundamental conflict between authorship verification and privacy preservation. Standard anonymization techniques often disrupt linguistic fluency, while rigorous Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms typically degrade the statistical signals required for accurate detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose \textbf{DP-MGTD}, a framework incorporating an Adaptive Differentially Private Entity Sanitization algorithm. Our approach utilizes a two-stage mechanism that performs noisy frequency estimation and dynamically calibrates privacy budgets, applying Laplace and Exponential mechanisms to numerical and textual entities respectively. Crucially, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon where the application of DP noise amplifies the distinguishability between human and machine text by exposing distinct sensitivity patterns to perturbation. Extensive experiments on the MGTBench-2.0 dataset show that our method achieves near-perfect detection accuracy, significantly outperforming non-private baselines while satisfying strict privacy guarantees.

### 6. [SpeechMedAssist: Efficiently and Effectively Adapting Speech Language Models for Medical Consultation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04638v1)

Authors: Sirry Chen, Jieyi Wang, Wei Chen, Zhongyu Wei

Medical consultations are intrinsically speech-centric. However, most prior works focus on long-text-based interactions, which are cumbersome and patient-unfriendly. Recent advances in speech language models (SpeechLMs) have enabled more natural speech-based interaction, yet the scarcity of medical speech data and the inefficiency of directly fine-tuning on speech data jointly hinder the adoption of SpeechLMs in medical consultation. In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all baselines in both effectiveness and robustness in most evaluation settings.

### 7. [From National Curricula to Cultural Awareness: Constructing Open-Ended Culture-Specific Question Answering Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04632v1)

Authors: Haneul Yoo, Won Ik Cho, Geunhye Kim, Jiyoon Han

Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on many tasks, but their progress remains uneven across languages and cultures, often reflecting values latent in English-centric training data. To enable practical cultural alignment, we propose a scalable approach that leverages national social studies curricula as a foundation for culture-aware supervision. We introduce CuCu, an automated multi-agent LLM framework that transforms national textbook curricula into open-ended, culture-specific question-answer pairs. Applying CuCu to the Korean national social studies curriculum, we construct KCaQA, comprising 34.1k open-ended QA pairs. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that KCaQA covers culture-specific topics and produces responses grounded in local sociocultural contexts.

Authors: Amit Bin Tariqul, A N M Zahid Hossain Milkan, Sahab-Al-Chowdhury, Syed Rifat Raiyan, Hasan Mahmud, Md Kamrul Hasan

As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for text generation, watermarking has become essential for authorship attribution, intellectual property protection, and misuse detection. While existing watermarking methods perform well in high-resource languages, their robustness in low-resource languages remains underexplored. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks. Experimental results show that layered watermarking improves post-RTT detection accuracy by 25-35%, achieving 40-50% accuracy, representing a 3$\times$ to 4$\times$ relative improvement over single-layer methods, at the cost of controlled semantic degradation. Our findings quantify the robustness-quality trade-off in multilingual watermarking and establish layered watermarking as a practical, training-free solution for low-resource languages such as Bangla. Our code and data will be made public.

Authors: Chenchen Yang, Kexin Huang, Liwei Fan, Qian Tu, Botian Jiang, Dong Zhang, Linqi Yin, Shimin Li, Zhaoye Fei, Qinyuan Cheng, Xipeng Qiu

Speech conveys not only linguistic information but also rich non-verbal vocal events such as laughing and crying. While semantic transcription is well-studied, the precise localization of non-verbal events remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Current methods suffer from insufficient task definitions with limited category coverage and ambiguous temporal granularity. They also lack standardized evaluation frameworks, hindering the development of downstream applications. To bridge this gap, we first develop a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal events, with a new categorization into discrete (standalone) versus continuous (mixed with speech) types. Based on the refined taxonomy, we introduce WESR-Bench, an expert-annotated evaluation set (900+ utterances) with a novel position-aware protocol that disentangles ASR errors from event detection, enabling precise localization measurement for both discrete and continuous events. We also build a strong baseline by constructing a 1,700+ hour corpus, and train specialized models, surpassing both open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while preserving ASR quality. We anticipate that WESR will serve as a foundational resource for future research in modeling rich, real-world auditory scenes.

### 10. [Inside Out: Evolving User-Centric Core Memory Trees for Long-Term Personalized Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05171v1)

Authors: Jihao Zhao, Ding Chen, Zhaoxin Fan, Kerun Xu, Mengting Hu, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu li

Existing long-term personalized dialogue systems struggle to reconcile unbounded interaction streams with finite context constraints, often succumbing to memory noise accumulation, reasoning degradation, and persona inconsistency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Inside Out, a framework that utilizes a globally maintained PersonaTree as the carrier of long-term user profiling. By constraining the trunk with an initial schema and updating the branches and leaves, PersonaTree enables controllable growth, achieving memory compression while preserving consistency. Moreover, we train a lightweight MemListener via reinforcement learning with process-based rewards to produce structured, executable, and interpretable {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NO_OP} operations, thereby supporting the dynamic evolution of the personalized tree. During response generation, PersonaTree is directly leveraged to enhance outputs in latency-sensitive scenarios; when users require more details, the agentic mode is triggered to introduce details on-demand under the constraints of the PersonaTree. Experiments show that PersonaTree outperforms full-text concatenation and various personalized memory systems in suppressing contextual noise and maintaining persona consistency. Notably, the small MemListener model achieves memory-operation decision performance comparable to, or even surpassing, powerful reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Gemini-3-Pro.

### Cryptography and Security

### 1. [Decision-Aware Trust Signal Alignment for SOC Alert Triage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04486v1)

Authors: Israt Jahan Chowdhury, Md Abu Yousuf Tanvir

Detection systems that utilize machine learning are progressively implemented at Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to help an analyst to filter through high volumes of security alerts. Practically, such systems tend to reveal probabilistic results or confidence scores which are ill-calibrated and hard to read when under pressure. Qualitative and survey based studies of SOC practice done before reveal that poor alert quality and alert overload greatly augment the burden on the analyst, especially when tool outputs are not coherent with decision requirements, or signal noise. One of the most significant limitations is that model confidence is usually shown without expressing that there are asymmetric costs in decision making where false alarms are much less harmful than missed attacks. The present paper presents a decision-sensitive trust signal correspondence scheme of SOC alert triage. The framework combines confidence that has been calibrated, lightweight uncertainty cues, and cost-sensitive decision thresholds into coherent decision-support layer, instead of making changes to detection models. To enhance probabilistic consistency, the calibration is done using the known post-hoc methods and the uncertainty cues give conservative protection in situations where model certainty is low. To measure the model-independent performance of the suggested model, we apply the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifiers to the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection benchmark. According to simulation findings, false negatives are greatly amplified by the presence of misaligned displays of confidence, whereas cost weighted loss decreases by orders of magnitude between models with decision aligned trust signals. Lastly, we describe a human-in-the-loop study plan that would allow empirically assessing the decision-making of the analysts with aligned and misaligned trust interfaces.

Authors: Konstantinos E. Kampourakis, Vyron Kampourakis, Efstratios Chatzoglou, Georgios Kambourakis, Stefanos Gritzalis

Realistic, large-scale, and well-labeled cybersecurity datasets are essential for training and evaluating Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). However, they remain difficult to obtain due to privacy constraints, data sensitivity, and the cost of building controlled collection environments such as testbeds and cyber ranges. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can operate as controlled knowledge-to-data engines for generating structured synthetic network traffic datasets suitable for IDS research. We propose a methodology that combines protocol documentation, attack semantics, and explicit statistical rules to condition LLMs without fine-tuning or access to raw samples. Using the AWID3 IEEE~802.11 benchmark as a demanding case study, we generate labeled datasets with four state-of-the-art LLMs and assess fidelity through a multi-level validation framework including global similarity metrics, per-feature distribution testing, structural comparison, and cross-domain classification. Results show that, under explicit constraints, LLM-generated datasets can closely approximate the statistical and structural characteristics of real network traffic, enabling gradient-boosting classifiers to achieve F1-scores up to 0.956 when evaluated on real samples. Overall, the findings suggest that constrained LLM-driven generation can facilitate on-demand IDS experimentation, providing a testbed-free, privacy-preserving alternative that overcomes the traditional bottlenecks of physical traffic collection and manual labeling.

Authors: Tooba Qasim, Vasilios A. Siris, Izak Oosthuizen, Muttukrishnan Rajarajan, Sujit Biswas

Biometric authentication has become integral to digital identity systems, particularly in smart cities where it en-ables secure access to services across governance, trans-portation, and public infrastructure. Centralised archi-tectures, though widely used, pose privacy and scalabil-ity challenges due to the aggregation of sensitive biomet-ric data. Decentralised identity frameworks offer better data sovereignty and eliminate single points of failure but introduce new security concerns, particularly around mu-tual trust among distributed devices. In such environments, biometric sensors and verification agents must authenticate one another before sharing sensitive biometric data. Ex-isting authentication schemes rely on classical public key infrastructure, which is increasingly susceptible to quan-tum attacks. This work addresses this gap by propos-ing a quantum-secure communication protocol for decen-tralised biometric systems, built upon an enhanced Quan-tum Key Distribution (QKD) system. The protocol incorpo-rates quantum-resilient authentication at both the classical and quantum layers of QKD: post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is used to secure the classical channel, while authen-tication qubits verify the integrity of the quantum channel. Once trust is established, QKD generates symmetric keys for encrypting biometric data in transit. Qiskit-based sim-ulations show a key generation rate of 15 bits/sec and 89% efficiency. This layered, quantum-resilient approach offers scalable, robust authentication for next-generation smart city infrastructures.

### 5. [The Adverse Effects of Omitting Records in Differential Privacy: How Sampling and Suppression Degrade the Privacy-Utility Tradeoff (Long Version)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05180v1)

Authors: Àlex Miranda-Pascual, Javier Parra-Arnau, Thorsten Strufe

Sampling is renowned for its privacy amplification in differential privacy (DP), and is often assumed to improve the utility of a DP mechanism by allowing a noise reduction. In this paper, we further show that this last assumption is flawed: When measuring utility at equal privacy levels, sampling as preprocessing consistently yields penalties due to utility loss from omitting records over all canonical DP mechanisms -- Laplace, Gaussian, exponential, and report noisy max -- as well as recent applications of sampling, such as clustering.
  Extending this analysis, we investigate suppression as a generalized method of choosing, or omitting, records. Developing a theoretical analysis of this technique, we derive privacy bounds for arbitrary suppression strategies under unbounded approximate DP. We find that our tested suppression strategy also fails to improve the privacy-utility tradeoff. Surprisingly, uniform sampling emerges as one of the best suppression methods -- despite its still degrading effect. Our results call into question common preprocessing assumptions in DP practice.

### 6. [Unified Framework for Qualifying Security Boundary of PUFs Against Machine Learning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04697v1)

Authors: Hongming Fei, Zilong Hu, Prosanta Gope, Biplab Sikdar

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) serve as lightweight, hardware-intrinsic entropy sources widely deployed in IoT security applications. However, delay-based PUFs are vulnerable to Machine Learning Attacks (MLAs), undermining their assumed unclonability. There are no valid metrics for evaluating PUF MLA resistance, but empirical modelling experiments, which lack theoretical guarantees and are highly sensitive to advances in machine learning techniques. To address the fundamental gap between PUF designs and security qualifications, this work proposes a novel, formal, and unified framework for evaluating PUF security against modelling attacks by providing security lower bounds, independent of specific attack models or learning algorithms. We mathematically characterise the adversary's advantage in predicting responses to unseen challenges based solely on observed challenge-response pairs (CRPs), formulating the problem as a conditional probability estimation over the space of candidate PUFs. We present our analysis on previous "broken" PUFs, e.g., Arbiter PUFs, XOR PUFs, Feed-Forward PUFs, and for the first time compare their MLA resistance in a formal way. In addition, we evaluate the currently "secure" CT PUF, and show its security boundary. We demonstrate that the proposed approach systematically quantifies PUF resilience, captures subtle security differences, and provides actionable, theoretically grounded security guarantees for the practical deployment of PUFs.

### 7. [A Mathematical Theory of Payment Channel Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04835v1)

Authors: Rene Pickhardt

We introduce a geometric theory of payment channel networks that centers the polytope $W_G$ of feasible wealth distributions; liquidity states $L_G$ project onto $W_G$ via strict circulations. A payment is feasible iff the post-transfer wealth stays in $W_G$. This yields a simple throughput law: if $ζ$ is on-chain settlement bandwidth and $ρ$ the expected fraction of infeasible payments, the sustainable off-chain bandwidth satisfies $S = ζ/ ρ$.
  Feasibility admits a cut-interval view: for any node set S, the wealth of S must lie in an interval whose width equals the cut capacity $C(δ(S))$. Using this, we show how multi-party channels (coinpools / channel factories) expand $W_G$. Modeling a k-party channel as a k-uniform hyperedge widens every cut in expectation, so $W_G$ grows monotonically with k; for single nodes the expected accessible wealth scales linearly with $k/n$.
  We also analyze depletion. Under linear, asymmetric fees, cost-minimizing flow within a wealth fiber pushes cycles to the boundary, generically depleting channels except for a residual spanning forest. Three mitigation levers follow: (i) symmetric fees per direction, (ii) convex/tiered fees (effective flow control but at odds with source routing without liquidity disclosure), and (iii) coordinated replenishment (choose an optimal circulation within a fiber).
  Together, these results explain why two-party meshes struggle to scale and why multi-party primitives are more capital-efficient, yielding higher expected payment bandwidth. They also show how fee design and coordination keep operation inside the feasible region, improving reliability.

### 8. [$PC^2$: Politically Controversial Content Generation via Jailbreaking Attacks on GPT-based Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05150v1)

Authors: Wonwoo Choi, Minjae Seo, Minkyoo Song, Hwanjo Heo, Seungwon Shin, Myoungsung You

The rapid evolution of text-to-image (T2I) models has enabled high-fidelity visual synthesis on a global scale. However, these advancements have introduced significant security risks, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. Politically harmful content, such as fabricated depictions of public figures, poses severe threats when weaponized for fake news or propaganda. Despite its criticality, the robustness of current T2I safety filters against such politically motivated adversarial prompting remains underexplored. In response, we propose $PC^2$, the first black-box political jailbreaking framework for T2I models. It exploits a novel vulnerability where safety filters evaluate political sensitivity based on linguistic context. $PC^2$ operates through: (1) Identity-Preserving Descriptive Mapping to obfuscate sensitive keywords into neutral descriptions, and (2) Geopolitically Distal Translation to map these descriptions into fragmented, low-sensitivity languages. This strategy prevents filters from constructing toxic relationships between political entities within prompts, effectively bypassing detection. We construct a benchmark of 240 politically sensitive prompts involving 36 public figures. Evaluation on commercial T2I models, specifically GPT-series, shows that while all original prompts are blocked, $PC^2$ achieves attack success rates of up to 86%.

### 9. [Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Federal Learning of Computer Vision Models on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04912v1)

Authors: Damian Harenčák, Lukáš Gajdošech, Martin Madaras

Collaborative training of a machine learning model comes with a risk of sharing sensitive or private data. Federated learning offers a way of collectively training a single global model without the need to share client data, by sharing only the updated parameters from each client's local model. A central server is then used to aggregate parameters from all clients and redistribute the aggregated model back to the clients. Recent findings have shown that even in this scenario, private data can be reconstructed only using information about model parameters. Current efforts to mitigate this are mainly focused on reducing privacy risks on the server side, assuming that other clients will not act maliciously. In this work, we analyzed various methods for improving the privacy of client data concerning both the server and other clients for neural networks. Some of these methods include homomorphic encryption, gradient compression, gradient noising, and discussion on possible usage of modified federated learning systems such as split learning, swarm learning or fully encrypted models. We have analyzed the negative effects of gradient compression and gradient noising on the accuracy of convolutional neural networks used for classification. We have shown the difficulty of data reconstruction in the case of segmentation networks. We have also implemented a proof of concept on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module used in edge devices and simulated a federated learning process.

Authors: Yinghan Hou, Zongyou Yang, Xiaokun Yang

Distributed energy trading and carbon asset management involve high-frequency, small-value settlements with strong audit requirements. Fully on-chain designs incur excessive cost, while purely off-chain approaches lack verifiable consistency. This paper presents a hybrid on-chain and off-chain settlement framework that anchors settlement commitments and key constraints on-chain and links off-chain records through deterministic digests and replayable auditing. Experiments under publicly constrained workloads show that the framework significantly reduces on-chain execution and storage cost while preserving audit trustworthiness.

### 2. [TokenSeg: Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation via Hierarchical Visual Token Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04519v1)

Authors: Sen Zeng, Hong Zhou, Zheng Zhu, Yang Liu

Three-dimensional medical image segmentation is a fundamental yet computationally demanding task due to the cubic growth of voxel processing and the redundant computation on homogeneous regions. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TokenSeg}, a boundary-aware sparse token representation framework for efficient 3D medical volume segmentation. Specifically, (1) we design a \emph{multi-scale hierarchical encoder} that extracts 400 candidate tokens across four resolution levels to capture both global anatomical context and fine boundary details; (2) we introduce a \emph{boundary-aware tokenizer} that combines VQ-VAE quantization with importance scoring to select 100 salient tokens, over 60\% of which lie near tumor boundaries; and (3) we develop a \emph{sparse-to-dense decoder} that reconstructs full-resolution masks through token reprojection, progressive upsampling, and skip connections. Extensive experiments on a 3D breast DCE-MRI dataset comprising 960 cases demonstrate that TokenSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance with 94.49\% Dice and 89.61\% IoU, while reducing GPU memory and inference latency by 64\% and 68\%, respectively. To verify the generalization capability, our evaluations on MSD cardiac and brain MRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that TokenSeg consistently delivers optimal performance across heterogeneous anatomical structures. These results highlight the effectiveness of anatomically informed sparse representation for accurate and efficient 3D medical image segmentation.

### 3. [Multi-Scale Local Speculative Decoding for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05149v1)

Authors: Elia Peruzzo, Guillaume Sautière, Amirhossein Habibian

Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, yet their sequential nature imposes significant latency constraints. Speculative Decoding offers a promising avenue for acceleration, but existing approaches are limited by token-level ambiguity and lack of spatial awareness. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale Local Speculative Decoding (MuLo-SD), a novel framework that combines multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification to accelerate AR image generation. Our method leverages a low-resolution drafter paired with learned up-samplers to propose candidate image tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Crucially, we incorporate a local rejection and resampling mechanism, enabling efficient correction of draft errors by focusing on spatial neighborhoods rather than raster-scan resampling after the first rejection. We demonstrate that MuLo-SD achieves substantial speedups - up to $\mathbf{1.7\times}$ - outperforming strong speculative decoding baselines such as EAGLE-2 and LANTERN in terms of acceleration, while maintaining comparable semantic alignment and perceptual quality. These results are validated using GenEval, DPG-Bench, and FID/HPSv2 on the MS-COCO 5k validation split. Extensive ablations highlight the impact of up-sampling design, probability pooling, and local rejection and resampling with neighborhood expansion. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in speculative decoding for image synthesis, bridging the gap between efficiency and fidelity.

Authors: Juyuan Kang, Hao Zhu, Yan Zhu, Wei Zhang, Jianing Chen, Tianxiang Xiao, Yike Ma, Hao Jiang, Feng Dai

Crop mapping based on satellite images time-series (SITS) holds substantial economic value in agricultural production settings, in which parcel segmentation is an essential step. Existing approaches have achieved notable advancements in SITS segmentation with predetermined sequence lengths. However, we found that these approaches overlooked the generalization capability of models across scenarios with varying temporal length, leading to markedly poor segmentation results in such cases. To address this issue, we propose TEA, a TEmporal Adaptive SITS semantic segmentation method to enhance the model's resilience under varying sequence lengths. We introduce a teacher model that encapsulates the global sequence knowledge to guide a student model with adaptive temporal input lengths. Specifically, teacher shapes the student's feature space via intermediate embedding, prototypes and soft label perspectives to realize knowledge transfer, while dynamically aggregating student model to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Finally, we introduce full-sequence reconstruction as an auxiliary task to further enhance the quality of representations across inputs of varying temporal lengths. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method brings remarkable improvements across inputs of different temporal lengths on common benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available.

### 5. [Prototypicality Bias Reveals Blindspots in Multimodal Evaluation Metrics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04946v1)

Authors: Subhadeep Roy, Gagan Bhatia, Steffen Eger

Automatic metrics are now central to evaluating text-to-image models, often substituting for human judgment in benchmarking and large-scale filtering. However, it remains unclear whether these metrics truly prioritize semantic correctness or instead favor visually and socially prototypical images learned from biased data distributions. We identify and study \emph{prototypicality bias} as a systematic failure mode in multimodal evaluation. We introduce a controlled contrastive benchmark \textsc{\textbf{ProtoBias}} (\textit{\textbf{Proto}typical \textbf{Bias}}), spanning Animals, Objects, and Demography images, where semantically correct but non-prototypical images are paired with subtly incorrect yet prototypical adversarial counterparts. This setup enables a directional evaluation of whether metrics follow textual semantics or default to prototypes. Our results show that widely used metrics, including CLIPScore, PickScore, and VQA-based scores, frequently misrank these pairs, while even LLM-as-Judge systems exhibit uneven robustness in socially grounded cases. Human evaluations consistently favour semantic correctness with larger decision margins. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{\textsc{ProtoScore}}, a robust 7B-parameter metric that substantially reduces failure rates and suppresses misranking, while running at orders of magnitude faster than the inference time of GPT-5, approaching the robustness of much larger closed-source judges.

Authors: Ayush Pande

Existing methods for segmenting Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are often optimization-based, requiring slow per-scene training that sacrifices the zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation models. We introduce DivAS (Depth-interactive Voxel Aggregation Segmentation), an optimization-free, fully interactive framework that addresses these limitations. Our method operates via a fast GUI-based workflow where 2D SAM masks, generated from user point prompts, are refined using NeRF-derived depth priors to improve geometric accuracy and foreground-background separation. The core of our contribution is a custom CUDA kernel that aggregates these refined multi-view masks into a unified 3D voxel grid in under 200ms, enabling real-time visual feedback. This optimization-free design eliminates the need for per-scene training. Experiments on Mip-NeRF 360° and LLFF show that DivAS achieves segmentation quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while being 2-2.5x faster end-to-end, and up to an order of magnitude faster when excluding user prompting time.

### 7. [Integrated Framework for Selecting and Enhancing Ancient Marathi Inscription Images from Stone, Metal Plate, and Paper Documents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04800v1)

Authors: Bapu D. Chendage, Rajivkumar S. Mente

Ancient script images often suffer from severe background noise, low contrast, and degradation caused by aging and environmental effects. In many cases, the foreground text and background exhibit similar visual characteristics, making the inscriptions difficult to read. The primary objective of image enhancement is to improve the readability of such degraded ancient images. This paper presents an image enhancement approach based on binarization and complementary preprocessing techniques for removing stains and enhancing unclear ancient text. The proposed methods are evaluated on different types of ancient scripts, including inscriptions on stone, metal plates, and historical documents. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves classification accuracies of 55.7%, 62%, and 65.6% for stone, metal plate, and document scripts, respectively, using the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classifier. Using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, accuracies of 53.2%, 59.5%, and 67.8% are obtained. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement method in improving the readability of ancient Marathi inscription images.

### 8. [Segmentation-Driven Monocular Shape from Polarization based on Physical Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04776v1)

Authors: Jinyu Zhang, Xu Ma, Weili Chen, Gonzalo R. Arce

Monocular shape-from-polarization (SfP) leverages the intrinsic relationship between light polarization properties and surface geometry to recover surface normals from single-view polarized images, providing a compact and robust approach for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. Despite its potential, existing monocular SfP methods suffer from azimuth angle ambiguity, an inherent limitation of polarization analysis, that severely compromises reconstruction accuracy and stability. This paper introduces a novel segmentation-driven monocular SfP (SMSfP) framework that reformulates global shape recovery into a set of local reconstructions over adaptively segmented convex sub-regions. Specifically, a polarization-aided adaptive region growing (PARG) segmentation strategy is proposed to decompose the global convexity assumption into locally convex regions, effectively suppressing azimuth ambiguities and preserving surface continuity. Furthermore, a multi-scale fusion convexity prior (MFCP) constraint is developed to ensure local surface consistency and enhance the recovery of fine textural and structural details. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed approach, showing significant improvements in disambiguation accuracy and geometric fidelity compared with existing physics-based monocular SfP techniques.

Authors: Masatomo Yoshida, Haruto Namura, Nicola Adami, Masahiro Okuda

This work explores the visual capabilities and limitations of foundation models by introducing a novel adversarial attack method utilizing skeletonization to reduce the search space effectively. Our approach specifically targets images containing text, particularly mathematical formula images, which are more challenging due to their LaTeX conversion and intricate structure. We conduct a detailed evaluation of both character and semantic changes between original and adversarially perturbed outputs to provide insights into the models' visual interpretation and reasoning abilities. The effectiveness of our method is further demonstrated through its application to ChatGPT, which shows its practical implications in real-world scenarios.

Authors: Zuhair Ahmed Khan Taha, Mohammed Mudassir Uddin, Shahnawaz Alam

When researchers deploy large language models for autonomous tasks like reviewing literature or generating hypotheses, the computational bills add up quickly. A single research session using a 70-billion parameter model can cost around $127 in cloud fees, putting these tools out of reach for many academic labs. We developed AgentCompress to tackle this problem head-on. The core idea came from a simple observation during our own work: writing a novel hypothesis clearly demands more from the model than reformatting a bibliography. Why should both tasks run at full precision? Our system uses a small neural network to gauge how hard each incoming task will be, based only on its opening words, then routes it to a suitably compressed model variant. The decision happens in under a millisecond. Testing across 500 research workflows in four scientific fields, we cut compute costs by 68.3% while keeping 96.2% of the original success rate. For labs watching their budgets, this could mean the difference between running experiments and sitting on the sidelines

Authors: Ivan Smirnov, Segun T. Aroyehun, Paul Plener, David Garcia

The widespread adoption of automatic sentiment and emotion classifiers makes it important to ensure that these tools perform reliably across different populations. Yet their reliability is typically assessed using benchmarks that rely on third-party annotators rather than the individuals experiencing the emotions themselves, potentially concealing systematic biases. In this paper, we use a unique, large-scale dataset of more than one million self-annotated posts and a pre-registered research design to investigate gender biases in emotion detection across 414 combinations of models and emotion-related classes. We find that across different types of automatic classifiers and various underlying emotions, error rates are consistently higher for texts authored by men compared to those authored by women. We quantify how this bias could affect results in downstream applications and show that current machine learning tools, including large language models, should be applied with caution when the gender composition of a sample is not known or variable. Our findings demonstrate that sentiment analysis is not yet a solved problem, especially in ensuring equitable model behaviour across demographic groups.

### 2. [Homeostasis Under Technological Transition: How High-Friction Universities Adapt Through Early Filtering Rather Than Reconfiguration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04917v1)

Authors: H. R. Paz

Universities are widely expected to respond to technological transitions through rapid reconfiguration of programme demand and curricular supply. Using four decades of longitudinal administrative cohorts (1980-2019) from a large public university, we examine whether technological change is translated into observable shifts in programme hierarchy, or instead absorbed by institutional mechanisms that preserve structural stability. We show that programme rankings by entrant volume remain remarkably stable over time, while the translation of technological transitions into enrolment composition occurs with substantial delay. Short-run adjustment appears primarily in early persistence dynamics: attrition reacts sooner than choice, and "growth" in entrants can coexist with declining early survival - producing false winners in which expansion is decoupled from persistence. Macroeconomic volatility amplifies attrition and compresses between-programme differences, masking technological signals that would otherwise be interpreted as preference shifts. To explain why stability dominates responsiveness, we situate these patterns within nationally regulated constraints governing engineering education - minimum total hours and mandated practice intensity - which materially limit the speed of curricular adaptation (Ministerio de Educacion, 2021; Ley de Educacion Superior, 1995). National system metrics further support the plausibility of a high-friction equilibrium in which large inflows coexist with standardised outputs (Secretaria de Politicas Universitarias [SPU], 2022). These findings suggest that apparent rigidity is not an anomaly but the predictable outcome of a system optimised for stability over responsiveness.

We used machine learning and artificial intelligence: 1) to measure levels of peace in countries from news and social media and 2) to develop on-line tools that promote peace by helping users better understand their own media diet. For news media, we used neural networks to measure levels of peace from text embeddings of on-line news sources. The model, trained on one news media dataset also showed high accuracy when used to analyze a different news dataset. For social media, such as YouTube, we developed other models to measure levels of social dimensions important in peace using word level (GoEmotions) and context level (Large Language Model) methods. To promote peace, we note that 71% of people 20-40 years old daily view most of their news through short videos on social media. Content creators of these videos are biased towards creating videos with emotional activation, making you angry to engage you, to increase clicks. We developed and tested a Chrome extension, MirrorMirror, which provides real-time feedback to YouTube viewers about the peacefulness of the media they are watching. Our long term goal is for MirrorMirror to evolve into an open-source tool for content creators, journalists, researchers, platforms, and individual users to better understand the tone of their media creation and consumption and its effects on viewers. Moving beyond simple engagement metrics, we hope to encourage more respectful, nuanced, and informative communication.

### 4. [The unsuitability of existing regulations to reach sustainable AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04958v1)

Authors: Thomas Le Goff

This paper examines the European Union's emerging regulatory landscape - focusing on the AI Act, corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence regimes (CSRD and CSDDD), and data center regulation - to assess whether it can effectively govern AI's environmental footprint. We argue that, despite incremental progress, current approaches remain ill-suited to correcting the market failures underpinning AI-related energy use, water consumption, and material demand. Key shortcomings include narrow disclosure requirements, excessive reliance on voluntary standards, weak enforcement mechanisms, and a structural disconnect between AI-specific impacts and broader sustainability laws. The analysis situates these regulatory gaps within a wider ecosystem of academic research, civil society advocacy, standard-setting, and industry initiatives, highlighting risks of regulatory capture and greenwashing. Building on this diagnosis, the paper advances strategic recommendations for the COP30 Action Agenda, calling for binding transparency obligations, harmonized international standards for lifecycle assessment, stricter governance of data center expansion, and meaningful public participation in AI infrastructure decisions.

Authors: Yinghan Hou, Zongyou Yang, Xiaokun Yang

Distributed energy trading and carbon asset management involve high-frequency, small-value settlements with strong audit requirements. Fully on-chain designs incur excessive cost, while purely off-chain approaches lack verifiable consistency. This paper presents a hybrid on-chain and off-chain settlement framework that anchors settlement commitments and key constraints on-chain and links off-chain records through deterministic digests and replayable auditing. Experiments under publicly constrained workloads show that the framework significantly reduces on-chain execution and storage cost while preserving audit trustworthiness.

Learning Analytics (LA) is nowadays ubiquitous in many educational systems, providing the ability to collect and analyze student data in order to understand and optimize learning and the environments in which it occurs. On the other hand, the collection of data requires to comply with the growing demand regarding privacy legislation. In this paper, we use the Student Expectation of Learning Analytics Questionnaire (SELAQ) to analyze the expectations and confidence of students from different faculties regarding the processing of their data for Learning Analytics purposes. This allows us to identify four clusters of students through clustering algorithms: Enthusiasts, Realists, Cautious and Indifferents. This structured analysis provides valuable insights into the acceptance and criticism of Learning Analytics among students.

Authors: Jiayi Zhang, Conrad Borchers, Canwen Wang, Vishal Kumar, Leah Teffera, Bruce M. McLaren, Ryan S. Baker

In digital learning systems, gaming the system refers to occasions when students attempt to succeed in an educational task by systematically taking advantage of system features rather than engaging meaningfully with the content. Often viewed as a form of behavioral disengagement, gaming the system is negatively associated with short- and long-term learning outcomes. However, little research has explored this phenomenon beyond its behavioral representation, leaving questions such as whether students are cognitively disengaged or whether they engage in different self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies when gaming largely unanswered. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to examine students' cognitive engagement and SRL processes during gaming versus non-gaming periods, using utterance length and SRL codes inferred from think-aloud protocols collected while students interacted with an intelligent tutoring system for chemistry. We found that gaming does not simply reflect a lack of cognitive effort; during gaming, students often produced longer utterances, were more likely to engage in processing information and realizing errors, but less likely to engage in planning, and exhibited reactive rather than proactive self-regulatory strategies. These findings provide empirical evidence supporting the interpretation that gaming may represent a maladaptive form of SRL. With this understanding, future work can address gaming and its negative impacts by designing systems that target maladaptive self-regulation to promote better learning.

Authors: Encheng Su, Jianyu Wu, Chen Tang, Lintao Wang, Pengze Li, Aoran Wang, Jinouwen Zhang, Yizhou Wang, Yuan Meng, Xinzhu Ma, Shixiang Tang, Houqiang Li

As large language models (LLMs) transition from general knowledge retrieval to complex scientific discovery, their evaluation standards must also incorporate the rigorous norms of scientific inquiry. Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.

### 2. [Rule Rewriting Revisited: A Fresh Look at Static Filtering for Datalog and ASP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05108v1)

Authors: Philipp Hanisch, Markus Krötzsch

Static filtering is a data-independent optimisation method for Datalog, which generalises algebraic query rewriting techniques from relational databases. In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity. As a solution, we propose tractable approximations of the algorithm that can still yield much improved logic programs in typical cases, e.g., it can improve the performance of rule systems over real-world data in the order of magnitude.

### 3. [Responsibility Measures for Conjunctive Queries with Negation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04868v1)

Authors: Meghyn Bienvenu, Diego Figueira, Pierre Lafourcade

We contribute to the recent line of work on responsibility measures that quantify the contributions of database facts to obtaining a query result. In contrast to existing work which has almost exclusively focused on monotone queries, here we explore how to define responsibility measures for unions of conjunctive queries with negated atoms (UCQ${}^\lnot$). Starting from the question of what constitutes a reasonable notion of explanation or relevance for queries with negated atoms, we propose two approaches, one assigning scores to (positive) database facts and the other also considering negated facts. Our approaches, which are orthogonal to the previously studied score of Reshef et al., can be used to lift previously studied scores for monotone queries, known as drastic Shapley and weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS), to UCQ$^\lnot$. We investigate the data and combined complexity of the resulting measures, notably showing that the WSMS measures are tractable in data complexity for all UCQ${}^\lnot$ queries and further establishing tractability in combined complexity for suitable classes of conjunctive queries with negation.

### 4. [LGTD: Local-Global Trend Decomposition for Season-Length-Free Time Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04820v1)

Authors: Chotanansub Sophaken, Thanadej Rattanakornphan, Piyanon Charoenpoonpanich, Thanapol Phungtua-eng, Chainarong Amornbunchornvej

Time series decomposition into trend, seasonal structure, and residual components is a core primitive for downstream analytics such as anomaly detection, change-point detection, and forecasting. However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.
  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.
  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade.

### 5. [Does Provenance Interact?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04722v1)

Authors: Chrysanthi Kosyfaki, Ruiyuan Zhang, Nikos Mamoulis, Xiaofang Zhou

Data provenance (the process of determining the origin and derivation of data outputs) has applications across multiple domains including explaining database query results and auditing scientific workflows. Despite decades of research, provenance tracing remains challenging due to computational costs and storage overhead. In streaming systems such as Apache Flink, provenance graphs can grow super-linearly with data volume, posing significant scalability challenges. Temporal provenance is a promising direction, attaching timestamps to provenance information, enabling time-focused queries without maintaining complete historical records. However, existing temporal provenance methods primarily focus on system-level debugging, leaving a gap in data management applications. This paper proposes an agenda that uses Temporal Interaction Networks (TINs) to represent temporal provenance efficiently. We demonstrate TINs' applicability across streaming systems, transportation networks, and financial networks. We classify data into discrete and liquid types, define five temporal provenance query types, and propose a state-based indexing approach. Our vision outlines research directions toward making temporal provenance a practical tool for large-scale dataflows.

### 6. [Structural Indexing of Relational Databases for the Evaluation of Free-Connex Acyclic Conjunctive Queries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04757v1)

Authors: Cristian Riveros, Benjamin Scheidt, Nicole Schweikardt

We present an index structure to boost the evaluation of free-connex acyclic conjunctive queries (fc-ACQs) over relational databases. The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$.
  Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's "relational color refinement" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$.
  Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size.

### 2. [Quantifying Autoscaler Vulnerabilities: An Empirical Study of Resource Misallocation Induced by Cloud Infrastructure Faults](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04659v1)

Authors: Gijun Park

Resource autoscaling mechanisms in cloud environments depend on accurate performance metrics to make optimal provisioning decisions. When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts.

Authors: Ajay Singh, Nikos Metaxakis, Panagiota Fatourou

We present a new blocking linearizable stack implementation which utilizes sharding and fetch&increment to achieve significantly better performance than all existing concurrent stacks. The proposed implementation is based on a novel elimination mechanism and a new combining approach that are efficiently blended to gain high performance. Our implementation results in enhanced parallelism and low contention when accessing the shared stack. Experiments show that the proposed stack implementation outperforms all existing concurrent stacks by up to 2X in most workloads. It is particularly efficient in systems supporting a large number of threads and in high contention scenarios.

### 4. [Mechanism Design for Federated Learning with Non-Monotonic Network Effects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04648v1)

Authors: Xiang Li, Bing Luo, Jianwei Huang, Yuan Luo

Mechanism design is pivotal to federated learning (FL) for maximizing social welfare by coordinating self-interested clients. Existing mechanisms, however, often overlook the network effects of client participation and the diverse model performance requirements (i.e., generalization error) across applications, leading to suboptimal incentives and social welfare, or even inapplicability in real deployments. To address this gap, we explore incentive mechanism design for FL with network effects and application-specific requirements of model performance. We develop a theoretical model to quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation, revealing the non-monotonic nature of such effects. Based on these insights, we propose a Model Trading and Sharing (MoTS) framework, which enables clients to obtain FL models through either participation or purchase. To further address clients' strategic behaviors, we design a Social Welfare maximization with Application-aware and Network effects (SWAN) mechanism, exploiting model customer payments for incentivization. Experimental results on a hardware prototype demonstrate that our SWAN mechanism outperforms existing FL mechanisms, improving social welfare by up to $352.42\%$ and reducing extra incentive costs by $93.07\%$.

### 5. [Timeliness-Oriented Scheduling and Resource Allocation in Multi-Region Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04542v1)

Authors: Mengmeng Zhu, Yuxuan Sun, Yukuan Jia, Wei Chen, Bo Ai, Sheng Zhou

Collaborative perception (CP) is a critical technology in applications like autonomous driving and smart cities. It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.

### 6. [Asynchronous Secure Federated Learning with Byzantine aggregators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04930v1)

Authors: Antonella Del Pozzo, Achille Desreumaux, Mathieu Gestin, Alexandre Rapetti, Sara Tucci-Piergiovanni

Privacy-preserving federated averaging is a central approach for protecting client privacy in federated learning. In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency.

### 7. [Proof of Commitment: A Human-Centric Resource for Permissionless Consensus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04813v1)

Authors: Homayoun Maleki, Nekane Sainz, Jon Legarda

Permissionless consensus protocols require a scarce resource to regulate leader election and provide Sybil resistance. Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable.
  We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window.
  Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony.
  Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties. These results position PoCmt as a new point in the consensus design space, grounding permissionless security in sustained human effort rather than computation or capital.

Authors: Marco Laju, Donghyun Son, Saurabh Agarwal, Nitin Kedia, Myungjin Lee, Jayanth Srinivasa, Aditya Akella

LLM-driven agentic applications increasingly automate complex, multi-step tasks, but serving them efficiently remains challenging due to heterogeneous components, dynamic and model-driven control flow, long-running state, and unpredictable latencies. Nalar is a ground-up agent-serving framework that cleanly separates workflow specification from execution while providing the runtime visibility and control needed for robust performance. Nalar preserves full Python expressiveness, using lightweight auto-generated stubs that turn agent and tool invocations into futures carrying dependency and context metadata. A managed state layer decouples logical state from physical placement, enabling safe reuse, migration, and consistent retry behavior. A two-level control architecture combines global policy computation with local event-driven enforcement to support adaptive routing, scheduling, and resource management across evolving workflows. Together, these mechanisms allow Nalar to deliver scalable, efficient, and policy-driven serving of heterogeneous agentic applications without burdening developers with orchestration logic. Across three agentic workloads, Nalar cuts tail latency by 34--74\%, achieves up to $2.9\times$ speedups, sustains 80 RPS where baselines fail, and scales to 130K futures with sub-500 ms control overhead.

### 9. [Parallel Quadratic Selected Inversion in Quantum Transport Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04904v1)

Authors: Vincent Maillou, Matthias Bollhofer, Olaf Schenk, Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas, Mathieu Luisier

Driven by Moore's Law, the dimensions of transistors have been pushed down to the nanometer scale. Advanced quantum transport (QT) solvers are required to accurately simulate such nano-devices. The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism lends itself optimally to these tasks, but it is computationally very intensive, involving the selected inversion (SI) of matrices and the selected solution of quadratic matrix (SQ) equations. Existing algorithms to tackle these numerical problems are ideally suited to GPU acceleration, e.g., the so-called recursive Green's function (RGF) technique, but they are typically sequential, require block-tridiagonal (BT) matrices as inputs, and their implementation has been so far restricted to shared memory parallelism, thus limiting the achievable device sizes. To address these shortcomings, we introduce distributed methods that build on RGF and enable parallel selected inversion and selected solution of the quadratic matrix equation. We further extend them to handle BT matrices with arrowhead, which allows for the investigation of multi-terminal transistor structures. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a real dataset from the QT simulation of a nano-ribbon transistor and compare it with the sparse direct package PARDISO. When scaling to 16 GPUs, our fused SI and SQ solver is 5.2x faster than the SI module of PARDISO applied to a device 16x shorter. These results highlight the potential of our method to accelerate NEGF-based nano-device simulations.

Authors: Irfan Ullah, Young-Koo Lee

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning graph-structured data, but their scalability is hindered by inefficient mini-batch generation, data transfer bottlenecks, and costly inter-GPU synchronization. Existing training frameworks fail to overlap these stages, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \boldmath $\bm{4.6\,\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy. These results establish MQ-GNN as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training.

### 1. [Multi-Disciplinary Dataset Discovery from Citation-Verified Literature Contexts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05099v1)

Authors: Zhiyin Tan, Changxu Duan

Identifying suitable datasets for a research question remains challenging because existing dataset search engines rely heavily on metadata quality and keyword overlap, which often fail to capture the semantic intent of scientific investigation. We introduce a literature-driven framework that discovers datasets from citation contexts in scientific papers, enabling retrieval grounded in actual research use rather than metadata availability. Our approach combines large-scale citation-context extraction, schema-guided dataset recognition with Large Language Models, and provenance-preserving entity resolution. We evaluate the system on eight survey-derived computer science queries and find that it achieves substantially higher recall than Google Dataset Search and DataCite Commons, with normalized recall ranging from an average of 47.47% to a highest value of 81.82%. Beyond recovering gold-standard datasets, the method also surfaces additional datasets not documented in the surveys. Expert assessments across five top-level Fields of Science indicate that a substantial portion of the additional datasets are considered high utility, and some are regarded as novel for the specific topics chosen by the experts. These findings establish citation-context mining as an effective and generalizable paradigm for dataset discovery, particularly in settings where datasets lack sufficient or reliable metadata. To support reproducibility and future extensions, we release our code, evaluation datasets, and results on GitHub (https://github.com/Fireblossom/citation-context-dataset-discovery).

### 2. [Semantically Orthogonal Framework for Citation Classification: Disentangling Intent and Content](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05103v1)

Authors: Changxu Duan, Zhiyin Tan

Understanding the role of citations is essential for research assessment and citation-aware digital libraries. However, existing citation classification frameworks often conflate citation intent (why a work is cited) with cited content type (what part is cited), limiting their effectiveness in auto classification due to a dilemma between fine-grained type distinctions and practical classification reliability. We introduce SOFT, a Semantically Orthogonal Framework with Two dimensions that explicitly separates citation intent from cited content type, drawing inspiration from semantic role theory. We systematically re-annotate the ACL-ARC dataset using SOFT and release a cross-disciplinary test set sampled from ACT2. Evaluation with both zero-shot and fine-tuned Large Language Models demonstrates that SOFT enables higher agreement between human annotators and LLMs, and supports stronger classification performance and robust cross-domain generalization compared to ACL-ARC and SciCite annotation frameworks. These results confirm SOFT's value as a clear, reusable annotation standard, improving clarity, consistency, and generalizability for digital libraries and scholarly communication infrastructures. All code and data are publicly available on GitHub https://github.com/zhiyintan/SOFT.

Authors: Jennifer D'Souza, Soren Auer, Eleni Poupaki, Alex Watkins, Anjana Devi, Riikka L. Puurunen, Bora Karasulu, Adrie Mackus, Erwin Kessels

Scientific reviews are central to knowledge integration in materials science, yet their key insights remain locked in narrative text and static PDF tables, limiting reuse by humans and machines alike. This article presents a case study in atomic layer deposition and etching (ALD/E) where we publish review tables as FAIR, machine-actionable comparisons in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), turning them into structured, queryable knowledge. Building on this, we contrast symbolic querying over ORKG with large language model-based querying, and argue that a curated symbolic layer should remain the backbone of reliable neurosymbolic AI in materials science, with LLMs serving as complementary, symbolically grounded interfaces rather than standalone sources of truth.

### Discrete Mathematics

### 1. [Basis Number of Graphs Excluding Minors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05195v1)

Authors: Colin Geniet, Ugo Giocanti

The basis number of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that the cycle space of $G$ is generated by a family of cycles using each edge at most $k$ times. A classical result of Mac Lane states that planar graphs are exactly graphs with basis number at most 2, and more generally, graphs embedded on a fixed surface are known to have bounded basis number. Generalising this, we prove that graphs excluding a fixed minor $H$ have bounded basis number.
  Our proof uses the Graph Minor Structure Theorem, which requires us to understand how basis number behaves in tree-decompositions. In particular, we prove that graphs of treewidth $k$ have basis number bounded by some function of $k$. We handle tree-decompositions using the proof framework developed by Bojańczyk and Pilipczuk in their proof of Courcelle's conjecture.
  Combining our approach with independent results of Miraftab, Morin and Yuditsky (2025) on basis number and path-decompositions, one can moreover improve our upper bound to a polynomial one: there exists an absolute constant $c>0$ such that every $H$-minor free graph has basis number $O(|H|^c)$.

### 2. [Branch-width of connectivity functions is fixed-parameter tractable](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04756v1)

Authors: Tuukka Korhonen, Sang-il Oum

A connectivity function on a finite set $V$ is a symmetric submodular function $f \colon 2^V \to \mathbb{Z}$ with $f(\emptyset)=0$. We prove that finding a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$ for a connectivity function given by an oracle is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), by providing an algorithm of running time $2^{O(k^2)} γn^6 \log n$, where $γ$ is the time to compute $f(X)$ for any set $X$, and $n = |V|$. This improves the previous algorithm by Oum and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser.~B, 2007], which runs in time $γn^{O(k)}$. Our algorithm can be applied to rank-width of graphs, branch-width of matroids, branch-width of (hyper)graphs, and carving-width of graphs. This resolves an open problem asked by Hliněný [SIAM J. Comput., 2005], who asked whether branch-width of matroids given by the rank oracle is fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the best known dependency on $k$ in the running times of FPT algorithms for graph branch-width, rank-width, and carving-width.

### 3. [Large induced forests in planar multigraphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04637v1)

Authors: Mikhail Makarov

For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, denote by $a(G)$ the number of vertices in the largest induced forest in $G$. The Albertson-Berman conjecture, which is open since 1979, states that $a(G) \geq \frac{n}{2}$ for all simple planar graphs $G$. We show that the version of this problem for multigraphs (allowing parallel edges) is easily reduced to the problem about the independence number of simple planar graphs. Specifically, we prove that $a(M) \geq \frac{n}{4}$ for all planar multigraphs $M$ and that this lower bound is tight. Then, we study the case when the number of pairs of vertices with parallel edges, which we denote by $k$, is small. In particular, we prove the lower bound $a(M) \geq \frac{2}{5}n-\frac{k}{10}$ and that the Albertson-Berman conjecture for simple planar graphs, assuming that it holds, would imply the lower bound $a(M) \geq \frac{n-k}{2}$ for planar multigraphs, which would be better than the general lower bound when $k$ is small. Finally, we study the variant of the problem where the plane multigraphs are prohibited from having $2$-faces, which is the main non-trivial problem that we introduce in this article. For that variant without $2$-faces, we prove the lower bound $a(M) \geq \frac{3}{10}n+\frac{7}{30}$ and give a construction of an infinite sequence of multigraphs with $a(M)=\frac{3}{7}n+\frac{4}{7}$.

Authors: Evan Wrench, Ajay Singh, Younghun Roh, Panagiota Fatourou, Siddhartha Jayanti, Eric Ruppert, Yuanhao Wei

Augmentation makes search trees tremendously more versatile, allowing them to support efficient aggregation queries, order-statistic queries, and range queries in addition to insertion, deletion, and lookup. In this paper, we present the first lock-free augmented balanced search tree. Our algorithmic ideas build upon a recent augmented unbalanced search tree presented by Fatourou and Ruppert [DISC, 2024]. We implement both data structures, solving some memory reclamation challenges in the process, and provide an experimental performance analysis of them. We also present optimized versions of our balanced tree that use delegation to achieve better scalability and performance (by more than 2x in some workloads). Our experiments show that our augmented balanced tree is 2.2 to 30 times faster than the unbalanced augmented tree, and up to several orders of magnitude faster than unaugmented trees on 120 threads.

### 2. [A data structure for monomial ideals with applications to signature Gröbner bases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05026v1)

Authors: Pierre Lairez, Rafael Mohr, Théo Ternier

We introduce monomial divisibility diagrams (MDDs), a data structure for monomial ideals that supports insertion of new generators and fast membership tests. MDDs stem from a canonical tree representation by maximally sharing equal subtrees, yielding a directed acyclic graph. We establish basic complexity bounds for membership and insertion, and study empirically the size of MDDs. As an application, we integrate MDDs into the signature Gröbner basis implementation of the Julia package AlgebraicSolving.jl. Membership tests in monomial ideals are used to detect some reductions to zero, and the use of MDDs leads to substantial speed-ups.

### 3. [Learning Mixture Models via Efficient High-dimensional Sparse Fourier Transforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05157v1)

Authors: Alkis Kalavasis, Pravesh K. Kothari, Shuchen Li, Manolis Zampetakis

In this work, we give a ${\rm poly}(d,k)$ time and sample algorithm for efficiently learning the parameters of a mixture of $k$ spherical distributions in $d$ dimensions. Unlike all previous methods, our techniques apply to heavy-tailed distributions and include examples that do not even have finite covariances. Our method succeeds whenever the cluster distributions have a characteristic function with sufficiently heavy tails. Such distributions include the Laplace distribution but crucially exclude Gaussians.
  All previous methods for learning mixture models relied implicitly or explicitly on the low-degree moments. Even for the case of Laplace distributions, we prove that any such algorithm must use super-polynomially many samples. Our method thus adds to the short list of techniques that bypass the limitations of the method of moments.
  Somewhat surprisingly, our algorithm does not require any minimum separation between the cluster means. This is in stark contrast to spherical Gaussian mixtures where a minimum $\ell_2$-separation is provably necessary even information-theoretically [Regev and Vijayaraghavan '17]. Our methods compose well with existing techniques and allow obtaining ''best of both worlds" guarantees for mixtures where every component either has a heavy-tailed characteristic function or has a sub-Gaussian tail with a light-tailed characteristic function.
  Our algorithm is based on a new approach to learning mixture models via efficient high-dimensional sparse Fourier transforms. We believe that this method will find more applications to statistical estimation. As an example, we give an algorithm for consistent robust mean estimation against noise-oblivious adversaries, a model practically motivated by the literature on multiple hypothesis testing. It was formally proposed in a recent Master's thesis by one of the authors, and has already inspired follow-up works.

### 4. [An Invitation to "Fine-grained Complexity of NP-Complete Problems"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05044v1)

Authors: Jesper Nederlof

Assuming that P is not equal to NP, the worst-case run time of any algorithm solving an NP-complete problem must be super-polynomial. But what is the fastest run time we can get? Before one can even hope to approach this question, a more provocative question presents itself: Since for many problems the naive brute-force baseline algorithms are still the fastest ones, maybe their run times are already optimal?
  The area that we call in this survey "fine-grained complexity of NP-complete problems" studies exactly this question. We invite the reader to catch up on selected classic results as well as delve into exciting recent developments in a riveting tour through the area passing by (among others) algebra, complexity theory, extremal and additive combinatorics, cryptography, and, of course, last but not least, algorithm design.

### 5. [Inapproximability of Counting Permutation Patterns](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05166v1)

Authors: Michal Opler

Detecting and counting copies of permutation patterns are fundamental algorithmic problems, with applications in the analysis of rankings, nonparametric statistics, and property testing tasks such as independence and quasirandomness testing. From an algorithmic perspective, there is a sharp difference in complexity between detecting and counting the copies of a given length-$k$ pattern in a length-$n$ permutation. The former admits a $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)} \cdot n$ time algorithm (Guillemot and Marx, 2014) while the latter cannot be solved in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails (Berendsohn, Kozma, and Marx, 2021). In fact already for patterns of length 4, exact counting is unlikely to admit near-linear time algorithms under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions (Dudek and Gawrychowski, 2020).
  Recently, Ben-Eliezer, Mitrović and Sristava (2026) showed that for patterns of length up to 5, a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the pattern count can be computed in near-linear time, yielding a separation between exact and approximate counting for small patterns, and conjectured that approximate counting is asymptotically easier than exact counting in general. We strongly refute their conjecture by showing that, under ETH, no algorithm running in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ can approximate the number of copies of a length-$k$ pattern within a multiplicative factor $n^{(1/2-\varepsilon)k}$. The lower bound on runtime matches the conditional lower bound for exact pattern counting, and the obtained bound on the multiplicative error factor is essentially tight, as an $n^{k/2}$-approximation can be computed in $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\cdot n$ time using an algorithm for pattern detection.

### 6. [Using Ray-shooting Queries for Sublinear Algorithms for Dominating Sets in RDV Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04626v1)

Authors: Therese Biedl, Prashant Gokhale

In this paper, we study the dominating set problem in \emph{RDV graphs}, a graph class that lies between interval graphs and chordal graphs and is defined as the \textbf{v}ertex-intersection graphs of \textbf{d}ownward paths in a \textbf{r}ooted tree. It was shown in a previous paper that adjacency queries in an RDV graph can be reduced to the question whether a horizontal segment intersects a vertical segment. This was then used to find a maximum matching in an $n$-vertex RDV graph, using priority search trees, in $O(n\log n)$ time, i.e., without even looking at all edges. In this paper, we show that if additionally we also use a ray shooting data structure, we can also find a minimum dominating set in an RDV graph $O(n\log n)$ time (presuming a linear-sized representation of the graph is given). The same idea can also be used for a new proof to find a minimum dominating set in an interval graph in $O(n)$ time.

A connectivity function on a finite set $V$ is a symmetric submodular function $f \colon 2^V \to \mathbb{Z}$ with $f(\emptyset)=0$. We prove that finding a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$ for a connectivity function given by an oracle is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), by providing an algorithm of running time $2^{O(k^2)} γn^6 \log n$, where $γ$ is the time to compute $f(X)$ for any set $X$, and $n = |V|$. This improves the previous algorithm by Oum and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser.~B, 2007], which runs in time $γn^{O(k)}$.

Authors: Niloufar Alavi, Swati Shah, Rezvan Alamian, Stefan Goetz

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and electronics without the need for speech or physical movement. Such interfaces can be particularly beneficial in applications requiring rapid response times, such as driving, where a vehicle's advanced driving assistance systems could benefit from immediate understanding of a driver's intentions. This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signals through deep learning. A driving simulator created a controlled environment in which participants imagined controlling a vehicle during various driving scenarios, including left and right turns, as well as straight driving. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classified the detected EEG data with minimal pre-processing. Our model achieved an accuracy of 83.7% in distinguishing between the three steering intentions and demonstrated the ability of CNNs to process raw EEG data effectively. The classification accuracy was highest for right-turn segments, which suggests a potential spatial bias in brain activity. This study lays the foundation for more intuitive brain-to-vehicle communication systems.

Authors: Rupayan Bhattacharjee, Sergi Abadal, Carmen G. Almudever, Eduard Alarcon

Scaling quantum computers requires tight integration of cryogenic control electronics with quantum processors, where Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) face severe power and area constraints. We investigate quantum neural network (QNN) training and inference under finite DAC resolution constraints across various DAC resolutions. Pre-trained QNNs achieve accuracy nearly indistinguishable from infinite-precision baselines when deployed on quantum systems with 6-bit DAC control electronics, exhibiting an elbow curve with diminishing returns beyond 4 bits. However, training under quantization reveals gradient deadlock below 12-bit resolution as gradient magnitudes fall below quantization step sizes. We introduce temperature-controlled stochasticity that overcomes this through probabilistic parameter updates, enabling successful training at 4-10 bit resolutions that remarkably matches or exceeds infinite-precision baseline performance. Our findings demonstrate that low-resolution control electronics need not compromise QML performance, enabling significant power and area reduction in cryogenic control systems for practical deployment as quantum hardware scales.

Authors: Sławomir Lasota, Mathieu Lehaut, Julie Parreaux, Radosław Piórkowski

We study a generalisation of Büchi-Landweber games to the timed setting. The winning condition is specified by a non-deterministic timed automaton, and one of the players can elapse time. We perform a systematic study of synthesis problems in all variants of timed games, depending on which player's winning condition is specified, and which player's strategy (or controller, a finite-memory strategy) is sought. As our main result we prove ubiquitous undecidability in all the variants, both for strategy and controller synthesis, already for winning conditions specified by one-clock automata. This strengthens and generalises previously known undecidability results. We also fully characterise those cases where finite memory is sufficient to win, namely existence of a strategy implies existence of a controller. All our results are stated in the timed setting, while analogous results hold in the data setting where one-clock automata are replaced by one-register ones.

Authors: Yanming Liu, Xinyue Peng, Jiannan Cao, Xinyi Wang, Songhang Deng, Jintao Chen, Jianwei Yin, Xuhong Zhang

Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with external tools have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools.

### 3. [Generalised Quantifiers Based on Rabin-Mostowski Index](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04739v1)

Authors: Denis Kuperberg, Damian Niwiński, Paweł Parys, Michał Skrzypczak

In this work we introduce new generalised quantifiers which allow us to express the Rabin-Mostowski index of automata. Our main results study expressive power and decidability of the monadic second-order (MSO) logic extended with these quantifiers. We study these problems in the realm of both $ω$-words and infinite trees. As it turns out, the pictures in these two cases are very different. In the case of $ω$-words the new quantifiers can be effectively expressed in pure MSO logic. In contrast, in the case of infinite trees, addition of these quantifiers leads to an undecidable formalism.
  To realise index-quantifier elimination, we consider the extension of MSO by game quantifiers. As a tool, we provide a specific quantifier-elimination procedure for them. Moreover, we introduce a novel construction of transducers realising strategies in $ω$-regular games with monadic parameters.

### 1. [Differential Locally Injective Grid Deformation and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04494v1)

Authors: Julian Knodt, Seung-Hwan Baek

Grids are a general representation for capturing regularly-spaced information, but since they are uniform in space, they cannot dynamically allocate resolution to regions with varying levels of detail. There has been some exploration of indirect grid adaptivity by replacing uniform grids with tetrahedral meshes or locally subdivided grids, as inversion-free deformation of grids is difficult. This work develops an inversion-free grid deformation method that optimizes differential weight to adaptively compress space. The method is the first to optimize grid vertices as differential elements using vertex-colorings, decomposing a dense input linear system into many independent sets of vertices which can be optimized concurrently. This method is then also extended to optimize UV meshes with convex boundaries. Experimentally, this differential representation leads to a smoother optimization manifold than updating extrinsic vertex coordinates. By optimizing each sets of vertices in a coloring separately, local injectivity checks are straightforward since the valid region for each vertex is fixed. This enables the use of optimizers such as Adam, as each vertex can be optimized independently of other vertices. We demonstrate the generality and efficacy of this approach through applications in isosurface extraction for inverse rendering, image compaction, and mesh parameterization.

### 2. [Spacecube: A fast inverse hyperspectral georectification system](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05181v1)

Authors: Thomas P. Watson, Eddie L. Jacobs

Hyperspectral cameras provide numerous advantages in terms of the utility of the data captured. They capture hundreds of data points per sample (pixel) instead of only the few of RGB or multispectral camera systems. Aerial systems sense such data remotely, but the data must be georectified to produce consistent images before analysis. We find the traditional direct georectification method to be slow, and it is prone to artifacts. To address its downsides, we propose Spacecube, a program that implements a complete hyperspectral georectification pipeline, including our own fast inverse georectification technique, using OpenGL graphics programming technologies. Spacecube operates substantially faster than real-time and eliminates pixel coverage artifacts. It facilitates high quality interactive viewing, data exploration, and export of final products. We release Spacecube's source code publicly for the community to use.

Authors: Jinze Yu, Dayuan Jiang

Diagrams are crucial for communicating complex information, yet creating and modifying them remains a labor-intensive task. We present GenAI-DrawIO-Creator, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate diagram generation and manipulation in the structured XML format used by draw.io. Our system integrates Claude 3.7 to reason about structured visual data and produce valid diagram representations. Key contributions include a high-level system design enabling real-time diagram updates, specialized prompt engineering and error-checking to ensure well-formed XML outputs. We demonstrate a working prototype capable of generating accurate diagrams (such as network architectures and flowcharts) from natural language or code, and even replicating diagrams from images. Simulated evaluations show that our approach significantly reduces diagram creation time and produces outputs with high structural fidelity. Our results highlight the promise of Claude 3.7 in handling structured visual reasoning tasks and lay the groundwork for future research in AI-assisted diagramming applications.

Authors: Etai Sella, Yoav Baron, Hadar Averbuch-Elor, Daniel Cohen-Or, Or Patashnik

Recent diffusion-based image editing methods commonly rely on text or high-level instructions to guide the generation process, offering intuitive but coarse control. In contrast, we focus on explicit, prompt-free editing, where the user directly specifies the modification by cropping and pasting an object or sub-object into a chosen location within an image. This operation affords precise spatial and visual control, yet it introduces a fundamental challenge: preserving the identity of the pasted object while harmonizing it with its new context. We observe that attention maps in diffusion-based editing models inherently govern whether image regions are preserved or adapted for coherence. Building on this insight, we introduce LooseRoPE, a saliency-guided modulation of rotational positional encoding (RoPE) that loosens the positional constraints to continuously control the attention field of view. By relaxing RoPE in this manner, our method smoothly steers the model's focus between faithful preservation of the input image and coherent harmonization of the inserted object, enabling a balanced trade-off between identity retention and contextual blending. Our approach provides a flexible and intuitive framework for image editing, achieving seamless compositional results without textual descriptions or complex user input.

### 5. [From Idea to Co-Creation: A Planner-Actor-Critic Framework for Agent Augmented 3D Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05016v1)

Authors: Jin Gao, Saichandu Juluri

We present a framework that extends the Actor-Critic architecture to creative 3D modeling through multi-agent self-reflection and human-in-the-loop supervision. While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.

Authors: Xiang Li, Bing Luo, Jianwei Huang, Yuan Luo

Mechanism design is pivotal to federated learning (FL) for maximizing social welfare by coordinating self-interested clients. Existing mechanisms, however, often overlook the network effects of client participation and the diverse model performance requirements (i.e., generalization error) across applications, leading to suboptimal incentives and social welfare, or even inapplicability in real deployments. To address this gap, we explore incentive mechanism design for FL with network effects and application-specific requirements of model performance. We develop a theoretical model to quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation, revealing the non-monotonic nature of such effects. Based on these insights, we propose a Model Trading and Sharing (MoTS) framework, which enables clients to obtain FL models through either participation or purchase. To further address clients' strategic behaviors, we design a Social Welfare maximization with Application-aware and Network effects (SWAN) mechanism, exploiting model customer payments for incentivization. Experimental results on a hardware prototype demonstrate that our SWAN mechanism outperforms existing FL mechanisms, improving social welfare by up to $352.42\%$ and reducing extra incentive costs by $93.07\%$.

### 1. [Decision-Aware Trust Signal Alignment for SOC Alert Triage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04486v1)

Authors: Israt Jahan Chowdhury, Md Abu Yousuf Tanvir

Detection systems that utilize machine learning are progressively implemented at Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to help an analyst to filter through high volumes of security alerts. Practically, such systems tend to reveal probabilistic results or confidence scores which are ill-calibrated and hard to read when under pressure. Qualitative and survey based studies of SOC practice done before reveal that poor alert quality and alert overload greatly augment the burden on the analyst, especially when tool outputs are not coherent with decision requirements, or signal noise. One of the most significant limitations is that model confidence is usually shown without expressing that there are asymmetric costs in decision making where false alarms are much less harmful than missed attacks. The present paper presents a decision-sensitive trust signal correspondence scheme of SOC alert triage. The framework combines confidence that has been calibrated, lightweight uncertainty cues, and cost-sensitive decision thresholds into coherent decision-support layer, instead of making changes to detection models. To enhance probabilistic consistency, the calibration is done using the known post-hoc methods and the uncertainty cues give conservative protection in situations where model certainty is low. To measure the model-independent performance of the suggested model, we apply the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifiers to the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection benchmark. According to simulation findings, false negatives are greatly amplified by the presence of misaligned displays of confidence, whereas cost weighted loss decreases by orders of magnitude between models with decision aligned trust signals. Lastly, we describe a human-in-the-loop study plan that would allow empirically assessing the decision-making of the analysts with aligned and misaligned trust interfaces.

Authors: Chaerin Yu, Chihun Choi, Sunjae Lee, Hyosu Kim, Steven Y. Ko, Young-Bae Ko, Sangeun Oh

The proliferation of smart home devices has increased the complexity of controlling and managing them, leading to user fatigue. In this context, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling natural-language interfaces for Internet of Things (IoT) control. However, existing LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable and inefficient device control due to the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, high inference latency and cost, and limited personalization. To address these challenges, we present IoTGPT, an LLM-based smart home agent designed to execute IoT commands in a reliable, efficient, and personalized manner. Inspired by how humans manage complex tasks, IoTGPT decomposes user instructions into subtasks and memorizes them. By reusing learned subtasks, subsequent instructions can be processed more efficiently with fewer LLM calls, improving reliability and reducing both latency and cost. IoTGPT also supports fine-grained personalization by adapting individual subtasks to user preferences. Our evaluation demonstrates that IoTGPT outperforms baselines in accuracy, latency/cost, and personalization, while reducing user workload.

### 3. [Model of Spatial Human-Agent Interaction with Consideration for Others](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04657v1)

Authors: Takafumi Sakamoto, Yugo Takeuchi

Communication robots often need to initiate conversations with people in public spaces. At the same time, such robots must not disturb pedestrians. To handle these two requirements, an agent needs to estimate the communication desires of others based on their behavior and then adjust its own communication activities accordingly. In this study, we construct a computational spatial interaction model that considers others. Consideration is expressed as a quantitative parameter: the amount of adjustment of one's internal state to the estimated internal state of the other. To validate the model, we experimented with a human and a virtual robot interacting in a VR environment. The results show that when the participant moves to the target, a virtual robot with a low consideration value inhibits the participant's movement, while a robot with a higher consideration value did not inhibit the participant's movement. When the participant approached the robot, the robot also exhibited approaching behavior, regardless of the consideration value, thus decreasing the participant's movement. These results appear to verify the proposed model's ability to clarify interactions with consideration for others.

### 4. [Driver-Intention Prediction with Deep Learning: Real-Time Brain-to-Vehicle Communication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05084v1)

Authors: Niloufar Alavi, Swati Shah, Rezvan Alamian, Stefan Goetz

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and electronics without the need for speech or physical movement. Such interfaces can be particularly beneficial in applications requiring rapid response times, such as driving, where a vehicle's advanced driving assistance systems could benefit from immediate understanding of a driver's intentions. This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signals through deep learning. A driving simulator created a controlled environment in which participants imagined controlling a vehicle during various driving scenarios, including left and right turns, as well as straight driving. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classified the detected EEG data with minimal pre-processing. Our model achieved an accuracy of 83.7% in distinguishing between the three steering intentions and demonstrated the ability of CNNs to process raw EEG data effectively. The classification accuracy was highest for right-turn segments, which suggests a potential spatial bias in brain activity. This study lays the foundation for more intuitive brain-to-vehicle communication systems.

Authors: Xiyuan Zhu, Wenhan Lyu, Chaochao Fu, Yilin Wang, Jie Zheng, Qiyue Tan, Qianhe Chen, Yixin Yu, Ran Wang

Online recruitment platforms have become the dominant channel for modern hiring, yet most platforms offer only basic filtering capabilities, such as job title, keyword, and salary range. This hinders comprehensive analysis of multi-attribute relationships and job market patterns across different scales. We present RecruitScope, a visual analytics system designed to support multidimensional and cross-level exploration of recruitment data for job seekers and employers, particularly HR specialists. Through coordinated visualizations, RecruitScope enables users to analyze job positions and salary patterns from multiple perspectives, interpret industry dynamics at the macro level, and identify emerging positions at the micro level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RecruitScope through case studies that reveal regional salary distribution patterns, characterize industry growth trajectories, and discover high-demand emerging roles in the job market.

### 6. [Feel the Presence: The Effects of Haptic Sensation on VR-Based Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04596v1)

Authors: Xinyan Yu, Marius Hoggenmüller, Tram Thi Minh Tran, Martin Tomitsch

Virtual reality (VR) has been increasingly utilised as a simulation tool for human-robot interaction (HRI) studies due to its ability to facilitate fast and flexible prototyping. Despite efforts to achieve high validity in VR studies, haptic sensation, an essential sensory modality for perception and a critical factor in enhancing VR realism, is often absent from these experiments. Studying an interactive robot help-seeking scenario, we used a VR simulation with haptic gloves that provide highly realistic tactile and force feedback to examine the effects of haptic sensation on VR-based HRI. We compared participants' sense of presence and their assessments of the robot to a traditional setup using hand controllers. Our results indicate that haptic sensation enhanced participants' social and self-presence in VR and fostered more diverse and natural bodily engagement. Additionally, haptic sensations significantly influenced participants' affective-related perceptions of the robot. Our study provides insights to guide HRI researchers in building VR-based simulations that better align with their study contexts and objectives.

### 7. [How Users Consider Web Tracking When Seeking Health Information Online](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04485v1)

Authors: Martin P. Robillard, Lihn V. Nguyen, Deeksha Arya, Jin L. C. Guo

Health information websites offer instantaneous access to information, but have important privacy implications as they can associate a visitor with specific medical conditions. We interviewed 35 residents of Canada to better understand whether and how online health information seekers exercise three potential means of protection against surveillance: website selection, privacy-enhancing technologies, and self-censorship, as well as their understanding of web tracking. Our findings reveal how users' limited initiative and effectiveness in protecting their privacy could be associated with a missing or inaccurate understanding of how implicit data collection by third parties takes place on the web, and who collects the data. We conclude that to help Internet users achieve better self-data protection, we may need to shift privacy awareness efforts from what information is collected to how it is collected.

### 8. [What Students Ask, How a Generative AI Assistant Responds: Exploring Higher Education Students' Dialogues on Learning Analytics Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04919v1)

Authors: Yildiz Uzun, Andrea Gauthier, Mutlu Cukurova

Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) aim to support students' regulation of learning by translating complex data into feedback. Yet students, especially those with lower self-regulated learning (SRL) competence, often struggle to engage with and interpret analytics feedback. Conversational generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants have shown potential to scaffold this process through real-time, personalised, dialogue-based support. Further advancing this potential, we explored authentic dialogues between students and GenAI assistant integrated into LAD during a 10-week semester. The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning. Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers. At the same time, students' reflections underscored the importance of trust, need for greater adaptivity, context-awareness, and technical refinement in future systems.

### 9. [OnomaCompass: A Texture Exploration Interface that Shuttles between Words and Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04915v1)

Authors: Miki Okamura, Shuhey Koyama, Li Jingjing, Yoichi Ochiai

Humans can finely perceive material textures, yet articulating such somatic impressions in words is a cognitive bottleneck in design ideation. We present OnomaCompass, a web-based exploration system that links sound-symbolic onomatopoeia and visual texture representations to support early-stage material discovery. Instead of requiring users to craft precise prompts for generative AI, OnomaCompass provides two coordinated latent-space maps--one for texture images and one for onomatopoeic term--built from an authored dataset of invented onomatopoeia and corresponding textures generated via Stable Diffusion. Users can navigate both spaces, trigger cross-modal highlighting, curate findings in a gallery, and preview textures applied to objects via an image-editing model. The system also supports video interpolation between selected textures and re-embedding of extracted frames to form an emergent exploration loop. We conducted a within-subjects study with 11 participants comparing OnomaCompass to a prompt-based image-generation workflow using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image ("Nano Banana"). OnomaCompass significantly reduced workload (NASA-TLX overall, mental demand, effort, and frustration; p < .05) and increased hedonic user experience (UEQ), while usability (SUS) favored the baseline. Qualitative findings indicate that OnomaCompass helps users externalize vague sensory expectations and promotes serendipitous discovery, but also reveals interaction challenges in spatial navigation. Overall, leveraging sound symbolism as a lightweight cue offers a complementary approach to Kansei-driven material ideation beyond prompt-centric generation.

Authors: Xinyan Yu, Julie Stephany Berrio Perez, Marius Hoggenmüller, Martin Tomitsch, Tram Thi Minh Tran, Stewart Worrall, Wendy Ju

The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies is fundamentally reshaping paradigms of human-vehicle collaboration, raising not only an urgent need for innovative design solutions but also for policies that address corresponding broader tensions in society. To bridge the gap between HCI research and policy making, this workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in the automotive community to explore AV policy directions through collaborative speculation on the future of AVs. We designed The UnScripted Trip, a card game rooted in fictional narratives of autonomous mobility, to surface tensions around human-vehicle collaboration in future AV scenarios and to provoke critical reflections on design solutions and policy directions. Our goal is to provide an engaging, participatory space and method for automotive researchers, designers, and industry practitioners to collectively explore and shape the future of human-vehicle collaboration and its policy implications.

### Information Retrieval

### 1. [Exploring Recommender System Evaluation: A Multi-Modal User Agent Framework for A/B Testing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04554v1)

Authors: Wenlin Zhang, Xiangyang Li, Qiyuan Ge, Kuicai Dong, Pengyue Jia, Xiaopeng Li, Zijian Zhang, Maolin Wang, Yichao Wang, Huifeng Guo, Ruiming Tang, Xiangyu Zhao

In recommender systems, online A/B testing is a crucial method for evaluating the performance of different models. However, conducting online A/B testing often presents significant challenges, including substantial economic costs, user experience degradation, and considerable time requirements. With the Large Language Models' powerful capacity, LLM-based agent shows great potential to replace traditional online A/B testing. Nonetheless, current agents fail to simulate the perception process and interaction patterns, due to the lack of real environments and visual perception capability. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal user agent for A/B testing (A/B Agent). Specifically, we construct a recommendation sandbox environment for A/B testing, enabling multimodal and multi-page interactions that align with real user behavior on online platforms. The designed agent leverages multimodal information perception, fine-grained user preferences, and integrates profiles, action memory retrieval, and a fatigue system to simulate complex human decision-making. We validated the potential of the agent as an alternative to traditional A/B testing from three perspectives: model, data, and features. Furthermore, we found that the data generated by A/B Agent can effectively enhance the capabilities of recommendation models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/ABAgent.

Authors: Tingyu Wu, Zhisheng Chen, Ziyan Weng, Shuhe Wang, Chenglong Li, Shuo Zhang, Sen Hu, Silin Wu, Qizhen Lan, Huacan Wang, Ronghao Chen

Existing long-horizon memory benchmarks mostly use multi-turn dialogues or synthetic user histories, which makes retrieval performance an imperfect proxy for person understanding. We present \BenchName, a publicly releasable benchmark built from long-form autobiographical narratives, where actions, context, and inner thoughts provide dense evidence for inferring stable motivations and decision principles. \BenchName~reconstructs each narrative into a flashback-aware, time-anchored stream and evaluates models with evidence-linked questions spanning factual recall, subjective state attribution, and principle-level reasoning. Across diverse narrative sources, retrieval-augmented systems mainly improve factual accuracy, while errors persist on temporally grounded explanations and higher-level inferences, highlighting the need for memory mechanisms beyond retrieval. Our data is in \href{KnowMeBench}{https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/KnowMeBench}.

### 3. [Re-Rankers as Relevance Judges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04455v1)

Authors: Chuan Meng, Jiqun Liu, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Fengran Mo, Jeff Dalton, Maarten de Rijke

Using large language models (LLMs) to predict relevance judgments has shown promising results. Most studies treat this task as a distinct research line, e.g., focusing on prompt design for predicting relevance labels given a query and passage. However, predicting relevance judgments is essentially a form of relevance prediction, a problem extensively studied in tasks such as re-ranking. Despite this potential overlap, little research has explored reusing or adapting established re-ranking methods to predict relevance judgments, leading to potential resource waste and redundant development. To bridge this gap, we reproduce re-rankers in a re-ranker-as-relevance-judge setup. We design two adaptation strategies: (i) using binary tokens (e.g., "true" and "false") generated by a re-ranker as direct judgments, and (ii) converting continuous re-ranking scores into binary labels via thresholding. We perform extensive experiments on TREC-DL 2019 to 2023 with 8 re-rankers from 3 families, ranging from 220M to 32B, and analyse the evaluation bias exhibited by re-ranker-based judges. Results show that re-ranker-based relevance judges, under both strategies, can outperform UMBRELA, a state-of-the-art LLM-based relevance judge, in around 40% to 50% of the cases; they also exhibit strong self-preference towards their own and same-family re-rankers, as well as cross-family bias.

### 4. [Neurosymbolic Retrievers for Retrieval-augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04568v1)

Authors: Yash Saxena, Manas Gaur

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has made significant strides in overcoming key limitations of large language models, such as hallucination, lack of contextual grounding, and issues with transparency. However, traditional RAG systems consist of three interconnected neural components - the retriever, re-ranker, and generator - whose internal reasoning processes remain opaque. This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows. Preliminary results from mental health risk assessment tasks indicate that this neurosymbolic approach enhances both transparency and overall performance

### 5. [PROMISE: Process Reward Models Unlock Test-Time Scaling Laws in Generative Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04674v1)

Authors: Chengcheng Guo, Kuo Cai, Yu Zhou, Qiang Luo, Ruiming Tang, Han Li, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou

Generative Recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, reformulating recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence generation task over hierarchical Semantic IDs. However, existing methods suffer from a critical issue we term Semantic Drift, where errors in early, high-level tokens irreversibly divert the generation trajectory into irrelevant semantic subspaces. Inspired by Process Reward Models (PRMs) that enhance reasoning in Large Language Models, we propose Promise, a novel framework that integrates dense, step-by-step verification into generative models. Promise features a lightweight PRM to assess the quality of intermediate inference steps, coupled with a PRM-guided Beam Search strategy that leverages dense feedback to dynamically prune erroneous branches. Crucially, our approach unlocks Test-Time Scaling Laws for recommender systems: by increasing inference compute, smaller models can match or surpass larger models. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests on a large-scale platform demonstrate that Promise effectively mitigates Semantic Drift, significantly improving recommendation accuracy while enabling efficient deployment.

Authors: Franziska Pradel, Fabian Haak, Sven-Oliver Proksch, Philipp Schaer

Search engines are commonly used for online political information seeking. Yet, it remains unclear how search query suggestions for political searches that reflect the latent interest of internet users vary across countries and over time. We provide a systematic analysis of Google search engine query suggestions for European and national politicians. Using an original dataset of search query suggestions for European politicians collected in ten countries, we find that query suggestions are less stable over time in politicians' countries of origin, when the politicians hold a supranational role, and for female politicians. Moreover, query suggestions for political leaders and male politicians are more similar across countries. We conclude by discussing possible future directions for studying information search about European politicians in online search.

### 7. [Succeeding at Scale: Automated Multi-Retriever Fusion and Query-Side Adaptation for Multi-Tenant Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04646v1)

Authors: Prateek Jain, Shabari S Nair, Ritesh Goru, Prakhar Agarwal, Ajay Yadav, Yoga Sri Varshan Varadharajan, Constantine Caramanis

Large-scale multi-tenant retrieval systems amass vast user query logs yet critically lack the curated relevance labels required for effective domain adaptation. This "dark data" problem is exacerbated by the operational cost of model updates: jointly fine-tuning query and document encoders requires re-indexing the entire corpus, which is prohibitive in multi-tenant environments with thousands of isolated indices. To address these dual challenges, we introduce \textbf{DevRev Search}, a passage retrieval benchmark for technical customer support constructed through a fully automatic pipeline. We employ a \textbf{fusion-based candidate generation} strategy, pooling results from diverse sparse and dense retrievers, and utilize an LLM-as-a-Judge to perform rigorous \textbf{consistency filtering} and relevance assignment. We further propose a practical \textbf{Index-Preserving Adaptation} strategy: by fine-tuning only the query encoder via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we achieve competitive performance improvements while keeping the document index frozen. Our experiments on DevRev Search and SciFact demonstrate that targeting specific transformer layers in the query encoder yields optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs, offering a scalable path for personalized enterprise search.

### 8. [Multi-Disciplinary Dataset Discovery from Citation-Verified Literature Contexts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05099v1)

Authors: Zhiyin Tan, Changxu Duan

Identifying suitable datasets for a research question remains challenging because existing dataset search engines rely heavily on metadata quality and keyword overlap, which often fail to capture the semantic intent of scientific investigation. We introduce a literature-driven framework that discovers datasets from citation contexts in scientific papers, enabling retrieval grounded in actual research use rather than metadata availability. Our approach combines large-scale citation-context extraction, schema-guided dataset recognition with Large Language Models, and provenance-preserving entity resolution. We evaluate the system on eight survey-derived computer science queries and find that it achieves substantially higher recall than Google Dataset Search and DataCite Commons, with normalized recall ranging from an average of 47.47% to a highest value of 81.82%. Beyond recovering gold-standard datasets, the method also surfaces additional datasets not documented in the surveys. Expert assessments across five top-level Fields of Science indicate that a substantial portion of the additional datasets are considered high utility, and some are regarded as novel for the specific topics chosen by the experts. These findings establish citation-context mining as an effective and generalizable paradigm for dataset discovery, particularly in settings where datasets lack sufficient or reliable metadata. To support reproducibility and future extensions, we release our code, evaluation datasets, and results on GitHub (https://github.com/Fireblossom/citation-context-dataset-discovery).

Authors: Iaroslav Chelombitko, Ekaterina Chelombitko, Aleksey Komissarov

The quality of subword tokenization is critical for Large Language Models, yet evaluating tokenizers for morphologically rich Uralic languages is hampered by the lack of clean morpheme lexicons.
  We introduce SampoNLP, a corpus-free toolkit for morphological lexicon creation using MDL-inspired Self-Referential Atomicity Scoring, which filters composite forms through internal structural cues - suited for low-resource settings.
  Using the high-purity lexicons generated by SampoNLP for Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BPE tokenizers across a range of vocabulary sizes (8k-256k). We propose a unified metric, the Integrated Performance Score (IPS), to navigate the trade-off between morpheme coverage and over-splitting. By analyzing the IPS curves, we identify the "elbow points" of diminishing returns and provide the first empirically grounded recommendations for optimal vocabulary sizes (k) in these languages. Our study not only offers practical guidance but also quantitatively demonstrates the limitations of standard BPE for highly agglutinative languages. The SampoNLP library and all generated resources are made publicly available: https://github.com/AragonerUA/SampoNLP

### 10. [Adaptive Retrieval for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04618v1)

Authors: Jongho Kim, Jaeyoung Kim, Seung-won Hwang, Jihyuk Kim, Yu Jin Kim, Moontae Lee

We study leveraging adaptive retrieval to ensure sufficient "bridge" documents are retrieved for reasoning-intensive retrieval. Bridge documents are those that contribute to the reasoning process yet are not directly relevant to the initial query. While existing reasoning-based reranker pipelines attempt to surface these documents in ranking, they suffer from bounded recall. Naive solution with adaptive retrieval into these pipelines often leads to planning error propagation. To address this, we propose REPAIR, a framework that bridges this gap by repurposing reasoning plans as dense feedback signals for adaptive retrieval. Our key distinction is enabling mid-course correction during reranking through selective adaptive retrieval, retrieving documents that support the pivotal plan. Experimental results on reasoning-intensive retrieval and complex QA tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines by 5.6%pt.

### Machine Learning

### 1. [Prediction of Cellular Malignancy Using Electrical Impedance Signatures and Supervised Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04478v1)

Authors: Shadeeb Hossain

Bioelectrical properties of cells such as relative permittivity, conductivity, and characteristic time constants vary significantly between healthy and malignant cells across different frequencies. These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies. Ultimately, hardware prototype with embedded micro-electrodes and real-time control systems could pave the path for practical diagnostic tools capable of in-situ cell classification.

### 2. [Convergence Rates for Learning Pseudo-Differential Operators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04473v1)

Authors: Jiaheng Chen, Daniel Sanz-Alonso

This paper establishes convergence rates for learning elliptic pseudo-differential operators, a fundamental operator class in partial differential equations and mathematical physics. In a wavelet-Galerkin framework, we formulate learning over this class as a structured infinite-dimensional regression problem with multiscale sparsity. Building on this structure, we propose a sparse, data- and computation-efficient estimator, which leverages a novel matrix compression scheme tailored to the learning task and a nested-support strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors. In addition to obtaining convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing.

### 3. [Meta-probabilistic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04462v1)

Authors: Kevin Zhang, Yixin Wang

While probabilistic graphical models can discover latent structure in data, their effectiveness hinges on choosing well-specified models. Identifying such models is challenging in practice, often requiring iterative checking and revision through trial and error. To this end, we propose meta-probabilistic modeling (MPM), a meta-learning algorithm that learns generative model structure directly from multiple related datasets. MPM uses a hierarchical architecture where global model specifications are shared across datasets while local parameters remain dataset-specific. For learning and inference, we propose a tractable VAE-inspired surrogate objective, and optimize it through bi-level optimization: local variables are updated analytically via coordinate ascent, while global parameters are trained with gradient-based methods. We evaluate MPM on object-centric image modeling and sequential text modeling, demonstrating that it adapts generative models to data while recovering meaningful latent representations.

### 4. [TourPlanner: A Competitive Consensus Framework with Constraint-Gated Reinforcement Learning for Travel Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04698v1)

Authors: Yinuo Wang, Mining Tan, Wenxiang Jiao, Xiaoxi Li, Hao Wang, Xuanyu Zhang, Yuan Lu, Weiming Dong

Travel planning is a sophisticated decision-making process that requires synthesizing multifaceted information to construct itineraries. However, existing travel planning approaches face several challenges: (1) Pruning candidate points of interest (POIs) while maintaining a high recall rate; (2) A single reasoning path restricts the exploration capability within the feasible solution space for travel planning; (3) Simultaneously optimizing hard constraints and soft constraints remains a significant difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met. Experimental results on travel planning benchmarks demonstrate that TourPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both feasibility and user-preference alignment.

Authors: Oluwatosin Oseni, Shengjie Wang, Jun Zhu, Micah Corah

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in real-world applications, particularly in robotics control. However, RL adoption remains limited due to insufficient safety guarantees. We introduce Nightmare Dreamer, a model-based Safe RL algorithm that addresses safety concerns by leveraging a learned world model to predict potential safety violations and plan actions accordingly. Nightmare Dreamer achieves nearly zero safety violations while maximizing rewards. Nightmare Dreamer outperforms model-free baselines on Safety Gymnasium tasks using only image observations, achieving nearly a 20x improvement in efficiency.

### 6. [Estimating Causal Effects in Gaussian Linear SCMs with Finite Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04673v1)

Authors: Aurghya Maiti, Prateek Jain

Estimating causal effects from observational data remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference, especially in the presence of latent confounders. This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.

### 7. [DP-MGTD: Privacy-Preserving Machine-Generated Text Detection via Adaptive Differentially Private Entity Sanitization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04641v1)

Authors: Lionel Z. Wang, Yusheng Zhao, Jiabin Luo, Xinfeng Li, Lixu Wang, Yinan Peng, Haoyang Li, XiaoFeng Wang, Wei Dong

The deployment of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) detection systems necessitates processing sensitive user data, creating a fundamental conflict between authorship verification and privacy preservation. Standard anonymization techniques often disrupt linguistic fluency, while rigorous Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms typically degrade the statistical signals required for accurate detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose \textbf{DP-MGTD}, a framework incorporating an Adaptive Differentially Private Entity Sanitization algorithm. Our approach utilizes a two-stage mechanism that performs noisy frequency estimation and dynamically calibrates privacy budgets, applying Laplace and Exponential mechanisms to numerical and textual entities respectively. Crucially, we identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon where the application of DP noise amplifies the distinguishability between human and machine text by exposing distinct sensitivity patterns to perturbation. Extensive experiments on the MGTBench-2.0 dataset show that our method achieves near-perfect detection accuracy, significantly outperforming non-private baselines while satisfying strict privacy guarantees.

### 8. [DeepHalo: A Neural Choice Model with Controllable Context Effects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04616v1)

Authors: Shuhan Zhang, Zhi Wang, Rui Gao, Shuang Li

Modeling human decision-making is central to applications such as recommendation, preference learning, and human-AI alignment. While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance while providing greater transparency into the drivers of choice.

We present a materials generation framework that couples a symmetry-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a differentiable SO(3) power spectrum objective to steer candidates toward a specified local environment under the crystallographic constraints. In particular, we implement a fully differentiable pipeline that performs batch-wise optimization on both direct and latent crystallographic representations. Using the GPU acceleration, the implementation achieves about fivefold speed compared to our previous CPU workflow, while yielding comparable outcomes. In addition, we introduce the optimization strategy that alternatively performs optimization on the direct and latent crystal representations. This dual-level relaxation approach can effectively overcome local barrier defined by different objective gradients, thus increasing the success rate of generating complex structures satisfying the targe local environments. This framework can be extended to systems consisting of multi-components and multi-environments, providing a scalable route to generate material structures with the target local environment.

### 10. [Density Matrix RNN (DM-RNN): A Quantum Information Theoretic Framework for Modeling Musical Context and Polyphony](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04592v1)

Authors: Joonwon Seo, Mariana Montiel

Classical Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) summarize musical context into a deterministic hidden state vector, imposing an information bottleneck that fails to capture the inherent ambiguity in music. We propose the Density Matrix RNN (DM-RNN), a novel theoretical architecture utilizing the Density Matrix. This allows the model to maintain a statistical ensemble of musical interpretations (a mixed state), capturing both classical probabilities and quantum coherences. We rigorously define the temporal dynamics using Quantum Channels (CPTP maps). Crucially, we detail a parameterization strategy based on the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, ensuring the learned dynamics remain physically valid (CPTP) by construction. We introduce an analytical framework using Von Neumann Entropy to quantify musical uncertainty and Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to measure entanglement between voices. The DM-RNN provides a mathematically rigorous framework for modeling complex, ambiguous musical structures.

Designing scientific instrumentation often requires exploring large, highly constrained design spaces using computationally expensive physics simulations. These simulators pose substantial challenges for integrating evolutionary computation (EC) into scientific design workflows. Evolutionary computation typically requires numerous design evaluations, making the integration of slow, low-throughput simulators particularly challenging, as they are optimized for accuracy and ease of use rather than throughput. We present ECLIPSE, an evolutionary computation framework built to interface directly with complex, domain-specific simulation tools while supporting flexible geometric and parametric representations of scientific hardware. ECLIPSE provides a modular architecture consisting of (1) Individuals, which encode hardware designs using domain-aware, physically constrained representations; (2) Evaluators, which prepare simulation inputs, invoke external simulators, and translate the simulator's outputs into fitness measures; and (3) Evolvers, which implement EC algorithms suitable for high-cost, limited-throughput environments. We demonstrate the utility of ECLIPSE across several active space-science applications, including evolved 3D antennas and spacecraft geometries optimized for drag reduction in very low Earth orbit. We further discuss the practical challenges encountered when coupling EC with scientific simulation workflows, including interoperability constraints, parallelization limits, and extreme evaluation costs, and outline ongoing efforts to combat these challenges. ECLIPSE enables interdisciplinary teams of physicists, engineers, and EC researchers to collaboratively explore unconventional designs for scientific hardware while leveraging existing domain-specific simulation software.

### 2. [Training a Custom CNN on Five Heterogeneous Image Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04727v1)

Authors: Anika Tabassum, Tasnuva Mahazabin Tuba, Nafisa Naznin

Deep learning has transformed visual data analysis, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) becoming highly effective in learning meaningful feature representations directly from images. Unlike traditional manual feature engineering methods, CNNs automatically extract hierarchical visual patterns, enabling strong performance across diverse real-world contexts. This study investigates the effectiveness of CNN-based architectures across five heterogeneous datasets spanning agricultural and urban domains: mango variety classification, paddy variety identification, road surface condition assessment, auto-rickshaw detection, and footpath encroachment monitoring. These datasets introduce varying challenges, including differences in illumination, resolution, environmental complexity, and class imbalance, necessitating adaptable and robust learning models.
  We evaluate a lightweight, task-specific custom CNN alongside established deep architectures, including ResNet-18 and VGG-16, trained both from scratch and using transfer learning. Through systematic preprocessing, augmentation, and controlled experimentation, we analyze how architectural complexity, model depth, and pre-training influence convergence, generalization, and performance across datasets of differing scale and difficulty. The key contributions of this work are: (1) the development of an efficient custom CNN that achieves competitive performance across multiple application domains, and (2) a comprehensive comparative analysis highlighting when transfer learning and deep architectures provide substantial advantages, particularly in data-constrained environments. These findings offer practical insights for deploying deep learning models in resource-limited yet high-impact real-world visual classification tasks.

### 3. [Paradoxical noise preference in RNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04539v1)

Authors: Noah Eckstein, Manoj Srinivasan

In recurrent neural networks (RNNs) used to model biological neural networks, noise is typically introduced during training to emulate biological variability and regularize learning. The expectation is that removing the noise at test time should preserve or improve performance. Contrary to this intuition, we find that continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) often perform best at a nonzero noise level, specifically, the same level used during training. This noise preference typically arises when noise is injected inside the neural activation function; networks trained with noise injected outside the activation function perform best with zero noise. Through analyses of simple function approximation, maze navigation, and single neuron regulator tasks, we show that the phenomenon stems from noise-induced shifts of fixed points (stationary distributions) in the underlying stochastic dynamics of the RNNs. These fixed point shifts are noise-level dependent and bias the network outputs when the noise is removed, degrading performance. Analytical and numerical results show that the bias arises when neural states operate near activation function nonlinearities, where noise is asymmetrically attenuated, and that performance optimization incentivizes operation near these nonlinearities. Thus, networks can overfit to the stochastic training environment itself rather than just to the input-output data. The phenomenon is distinct from stochastic resonance, wherein nonzero noise enhances signal processing. Our findings reveal that training noise can become an integral part of the computation learned by recurrent networks, with implications for understanding neural population dynamics and for the design of robust artificial RNNs.

### 4. [Neural-Symbolic Integration with Evolvable Policies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04799v1)

Authors: Marios Thoma, Vassilis Vassiliades, Loizos Michael

Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a promising approach for combining the learning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretable reasoning of symbolic systems. However, existing NeSy frameworks typically require either predefined symbolic policies or policies that are differentiable, limiting their applicability when domain expertise is unavailable or when policies are inherently non-differentiable. We propose a framework that addresses this limitation by enabling the concurrent learning of both non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural network weights through an evolutionary process. Our approach casts NeSy systems as organisms in a population that evolve through mutations (both symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes), with fitness-based selection guiding convergence toward hidden target policies. The framework extends the NEUROLOG architecture to make symbolic policies trainable, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework to the NeSy context, and employs Machine Coaching semantics for mutable symbolic representations. Neural networks are trained through abductive reasoning from the symbolic component, eliminating differentiability requirements. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that NeSy systems starting with empty policies and random neural weights can successfully approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving median correct performance approaching 100%. This work represents a step toward enabling NeSy research in domains where the acquisition of symbolic knowledge from experts is challenging or infeasible.

Authors: Ijaz Ahmad, Faizan Ahmad, Sunday Timothy Aboyeji, Yongtao Zhang, Peng Yang, Rab Nawaz, Baiying Lei

Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide, and poses significant risks, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Conventional unimodal approaches, primarily reliant on electroencephalography (EEG), face several key challenges, including low SNR, nonstationarity, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, portability, and real-time applicability in clinical settings. To address these issues, a comprehensive survey highlights the concept of advanced multimodal learning for epileptic seizure detection and prediction (AMLSDP). The survey presents the evolution of epileptic seizure detection (ESD) and prediction (ESP) technologies across different eras. The survey also explores the core challenges of multimodal and non-EEG-based ESD and ESP. To overcome the key challenges of the multimodal system, the survey introduces the advanced processing strategies for efficient AMLSDP. Furthermore, this survey highlights future directions for researchers and practitioners. We believe this work will advance neurotechnology toward wearable and imaging-based solutions for epilepsy monitoring, serving as a valuable resource for future innovations in this domain.

### 3. [A Mathematical Theory of Payment Channel Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04835v1)

Authors: Rene Pickhardt

We introduce a geometric theory of payment channel networks that centers the polytope $W_G$ of feasible wealth distributions; liquidity states $L_G$ project onto $W_G$ via strict circulations. A payment is feasible iff the post-transfer wealth stays in $W_G$. This yields a simple throughput law: if $ζ$ is on-chain settlement bandwidth and $ρ$ the expected fraction of infeasible payments, the sustainable off-chain bandwidth satisfies $S = ζ/ ρ$.
  Feasibility admits a cut-interval view: for any node set S, the wealth of S must lie in an interval whose width equals the cut capacity $C(δ(S))$. Using this, we show how multi-party channels (coinpools / channel factories) expand $W_G$. Modeling a k-party channel as a k-uniform hyperedge widens every cut in expectation, so $W_G$ grows monotonically with k; for single nodes the expected accessible wealth scales linearly with $k/n$.
  We also analyze depletion. Under linear, asymmetric fees, cost-minimizing flow within a wealth fiber pushes cycles to the boundary, generically depleting channels except for a residual spanning forest. Three mitigation levers follow: (i) symmetric fees per direction, (ii) convex/tiered fees (effective flow control but at odds with source routing without liquidity disclosure), and (iii) coordinated replenishment (choose an optimal circulation within a fiber).
  Together, these results explain why two-party meshes struggle to scale and why multi-party primitives are more capital-efficient, yielding higher expected payment bandwidth. They also show how fee design and coordination keep operation inside the feasible region, improving reliability.

### 4. [A DQN-based model for intelligent network selection in heterogeneous wireless systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04978v1)

Authors: Fayssal Bendaoud, Asma Amraoui, karim Sehimi

Wireless communications have been at the center of the revolution in technology for the last few years. The 5G communication system is the pinnacle of these technologies; however 4G LTE, WiFi, and even satellite technologies are still employed worldwide. So, the aim of the next generation network is to take advantage of these technologies for the better of the end users. Our research analyzes this subject and reveals a new and intelligent method that allows users to select the suitable RAT at each time and, therefore, to switch to another RAT if necessary. The Deep Q Network DQN algorithm was utilized, which is a reinforcement learning algorithm that determines judgments based on antecedent actions (rewards and punishments). The approach exhibits a high accuracy, reaching 93 percent, especially after a given number of epochs (the exploration phase), compared to typical MADM methods where the accuracy does not exceed 75 percent

### 5. [Intelligent resource allocation in wireless networks via deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04842v1)

Authors: Marie Diane Iradukunda, Chabi F. Elégbédé, Yaé Ulrich Gaba

This study addresses the challenge of optimal power allocation in stochastic wireless networks by employing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. Specifically, we design a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent capable of learning adaptive power control policies directly from channel state observations, effectively bypassing the need for explicit system models. We formulate the resource allocation problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and benchmark the proposed approach against classical heuristics, including fixed allocation, random assignment, and the theoretical water-filling algorithm. Empirical results demonstrate that the DQN agent achieves a system throughput of 3.88 Mbps, effectively matching the upper limit of the water fill, while outperforming the random and fixed allocation strategies by approximately 73% and 27%, respectively. Moreover, the agent exhibits emergent fairness, maintaining a Jain's Index of 0.91, and successfully optimizes the trade-off between spectral efficiency and energy consumption. These findings substantiate the efficacy of model-free DRL as a robust and scalable solution for resource management in next-generation communication systems.

Authors: Oluwatosin Oseni, Shengjie Wang, Jun Zhu, Micah Corah

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in real-world applications, particularly in robotics control. However, RL adoption remains limited due to insufficient safety guarantees. We introduce Nightmare Dreamer, a model-based Safe RL algorithm that addresses safety concerns by leveraging a learned world model to predict potential safety violations and plan actions accordingly. Nightmare Dreamer achieves nearly zero safety violations while maximizing rewards. Nightmare Dreamer outperforms model-free baselines on Safety Gymnasium tasks using only image observations, achieving nearly a 20x improvement in efficiency.

### 2. [Model of Spatial Human-Agent Interaction with Consideration for Others](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04657v1)

Authors: Takafumi Sakamoto, Yugo Takeuchi

Communication robots often need to initiate conversations with people in public spaces. At the same time, such robots must not disturb pedestrians. To handle these two requirements, an agent needs to estimate the communication desires of others based on their behavior and then adjust its own communication activities accordingly. In this study, we construct a computational spatial interaction model that considers others. Consideration is expressed as a quantitative parameter: the amount of adjustment of one's internal state to the estimated internal state of the other. To validate the model, we experimented with a human and a virtual robot interacting in a VR environment. The results show that when the participant moves to the target, a virtual robot with a low consideration value inhibits the participant's movement, while a robot with a higher consideration value did not inhibit the participant's movement. When the participant approached the robot, the robot also exhibited approaching behavior, regardless of the consideration value, thus decreasing the participant's movement. These results appear to verify the proposed model's ability to clarify interactions with consideration for others.

### 3. [Discrete Fourier Transform-based Point Cloud Compression for Efficient SLAM in Featureless Terrain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04551v1)

Authors: Riku Suzuki, Ayumi Umemura, Shreya Santra, Kentaro Uno, Kazuya Yoshida

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an essential technology for the efficiency and reliability of unmanned robotic exploration missions. While the onboard computational capability and communication bandwidth are critically limited, the point cloud data handled by SLAM is large in size, attracting attention to data compression methods. To address such a problem, in this paper, we propose a new method for compressing point cloud maps by exploiting the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The proposed technique converts the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to the frequency-domain 2D image and omits its high-frequency components, focusing on the exploration of gradual terrains such as planets and deserts. Unlike terrains with detailed structures such as artificial environments, high-frequency components contribute little to the representation of gradual terrains. Thus, this method is effective in compressing data size without significant degradation of the point cloud. We evaluated the method in terms of compression rate and accuracy using camera sequences of two terrains with different elevation profiles.

Authors: Yuxin Wang, Yuankai He, Boyang Tian, Lichen Xian, Weisong Shi

Vehicle computing represents a fundamental shift in how autonomous vehicles are designed and deployed, transforming them from isolated transportation systems into mobile computing platforms that support both safety-critical, real-time driving and data-centric services. In this setting, vehicles simultaneously support real-time driving pipelines and a growing set of data-driven applications, placing increased responsibility on the vehicle operating system to coordinate computation, data movement, storage, and access. These demands highlight recurring system considerations related to predictable execution, data and execution protection, efficient handling of high-rate sensor data, and long-term system evolvability, commonly summarized as Safety, Security, Efficiency, and Extensibility (SSEE). Existing vehicle operating systems and runtimes address these concerns in isolation, resulting in fragmented software stacks that limit coordination between autonomy workloads and vehicle data services. This paper presents DAVOS, the Delaware Autonomous Vehicle Operating System, a unified vehicle operating system architecture designed for the vehicle computing context. DAVOS provides a cohesive operating system foundation that supports both real-time autonomy and extensible vehicle computing within a single system framework.

### 6. [LaST$_{0}$: Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05248v1)

Authors: Zhuoyang Liu, Jiaming Liu, Hao Chen, Ziyu Guo, Chengkai Hou, Chenyang Gu, Jiale Yu, Xiangju Mi, Renrui Zhang, Zhengping Che, Jian Tang, Pheng-Ann Heng, Shanghang Zhang

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation. Some existing VLA approaches attempt to improve action accuracy by explicitly generating linguistic reasoning traces or future visual observations before action execution. However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching between reasoning and action inference rates during deployment. Across ten simulated and six real-world manipulation tasks, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 8% and 13% over prior VLA methods, respectively, while achieving substantially faster inference.

### 7. [Zero Wrench Control via Wrench Disturbance Observer for Learning-free Peg-in-hole Assembly](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04881v1)

Authors: Kiyoung Choi, Juwon Jeong, Sehoon Oh

This paper proposes a Dynamic Wrench Disturbance Observer (DW-DOB) designed to achieve highly sensitive zero-wrench control in contact-rich manipulation. By embedding task-space inertia into the observer nominal model, DW-DOB cleanly separates intrinsic dynamic reactions from true external wrenches. This preserves sensitivity to small forces and moments while ensuring robust regulation of contact wrenches. A passivity-based analysis further demonstrates that DW-DOB guarantees stable interactions under dynamic conditions, addressing the shortcomings of conventional observers that fail to compensate for inertial effects. Peg-in-hole experiments at industrial tolerances (H7/h6) validate the approach, yielding deeper and more compliant insertions with minimal residual wrenches and outperforming a conventional wrench disturbance observer and a PD baseline. These results highlight DW-DOB as a practical learning-free solution for high-precision zero-wrench control in contact-rich tasks.

### 8. [Fast Continuum Robot Shape and External Load State Estimation on SE(3)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04493v1)

Authors: James M. Ferguson, Alan Kuntz, Tucker Hermans

Previous on-manifold approaches to continuum robot state estimation have typically adopted simplified Cosserat rod models, which cannot directly account for actuation inputs or external loads. We introduce a general framework that incorporates uncertainty models for actuation (e.g., tendon tensions), applied forces and moments, process noise, boundary conditions, and arbitrary backbone measurements. By adding temporal priors across time steps, our method additionally performs joint estimation in both the spatial (arclength) and temporal domains, enabling full \textit{spacetime} state estimation. Discretizing the arclength domain yields a factor graph representation of the continuum robot model, which can be exploited for fast batch sparse nonlinear optimization in the style of SLAM. The framework is general and applies to a broad class of continuum robots; as illustrative cases, we show (i) tendon-driven robots in simulation, where we demonstrate real-time kinematics with uncertainty, tip force sensing from position feedback, and distributed load estimation from backbone strain, and (ii) a surgical concentric tube robot in experiment, where we validate accurate kinematics and tip force estimation, highlighting potential for surgical palpation.

### 9. [When to Act: Calibrated Confidence for Reliable Human Intention Prediction in Assistive Robotics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04982v1)

Authors: Johannes A. Gaus, Winfried Ilg, Daniel Haeufle

Assistive devices must determine both what a user intends to do and how reliable that prediction is before providing support. We introduce a safety-critical triggering framework based on calibrated probabilities for multimodal next-action prediction in Activities of Daily Living. Raw model confidence often fails to reflect true correctness, posing a safety risk. Post-hoc calibration aligns predicted confidence with empirical reliability and reduces miscalibration by about an order of magnitude without affecting accuracy. The calibrated confidence drives a simple ACT/HOLD rule that acts only when reliability is high and withholds assistance otherwise. This turns the confidence threshold into a quantitative safety parameter for assisted actions and enables verifiable behavior in an assistive control loop.

### 10. [Optimizing Path Planning using Deep Reinforcement Learning for UGVs in Precision Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04668v1)

Authors: Laukik Patade, Rohan Rane, Sandeep Pillai

This study focuses on optimizing path planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in precision agriculture using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in continuous action spaces. The research begins with a review of traditional grid-based methods, such as A* and Dijkstra's algorithms, and discusses their limitations in dynamic agricultural environments, highlighting the need for adaptive learning strategies. The study then explores DRL approaches, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which demonstrate improved adaptability and performance in two-dimensional simulations. Enhancements such as Double Q-Networks and Dueling Networks are evaluated to further improve decision-making. Building on these results, the focus shifts to continuous action space models, specifically Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), which are tested in increasingly complex environments. Experiments conducted in a three-dimensional environment using ROS and Gazebo demonstrate the effectiveness of continuous DRL algorithms in navigating dynamic agricultural scenarios. Notably, the pretrained TD3 agent achieves a 95 percent success rate in dynamic environments, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach in handling moving obstacles while ensuring safety for both crops and the robot.

### 1. [4D-ARE: Bridging the Attribution Gap in LLM Agent Requirements Engineering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04556v1)

Authors: Bo Yu, Lei Zhao

We deployed an LLM agent with ReAct reasoning and full data access. It executed flawlessly, yet when asked "Why is completion rate 80%?", it returned metrics instead of causal explanation. The agent knew how to reason but we had not specified what to reason about. This reflects a gap: runtime reasoning frameworks (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought) have transformed LLM agents, but design-time specification--determining what domain knowledge agents need--remains under-explored. We propose 4D-ARE (4-Dimensional Attribution-Driven Agent Requirements Engineering), a preliminary methodology for specifying attribution-driven agents. The core insight: decision-makers seek attribution, not answers. Attribution concerns organize into four dimensions (Results -> Process -> Support -> Long-term), motivated by Pearl's causal hierarchy. The framework operationalizes through five layers producing artifacts that compile directly to system prompts. We demonstrate the methodology through an industrial pilot deployment in financial services. 4D-ARE addresses what agents should reason about, complementing runtime frameworks that address how. We hypothesize systematic specification amplifies the power of these foundational advances. This paper presents a methodological proposal with preliminary industrial validation; rigorous empirical evaluation is planned for future work.

Authors: Jefferson Seide Molléri, Sami Hyrynsalmi, Antti Hakkala, Kai K. Kimppa, Jouni Smed

This paper presents a longitudinal ethical analysis of Untappd, a social drinking application that gamifies beer consumption through badges, streaks, and social sharing. Building on an exploratory study conducted in 2020, we revisit the platform in 2025 to examine how its gamification features and ethical framings have evolved. Drawing on traditional ethical theory and practical frameworks for Software Engineering, we analyze five categories of badges and their implications for user autonomy and well-being. Our findings show that, despite small adjustments and superficial disclaimers, many of the original ethical issues remain. We argue for continuous ethical reflection built embedded into software lifecycles to prevent the normalization of risky behaviors through design.

### 3. [AdaptEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Code Snippet Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04540v1)

Authors: Tanghaoran Zhang, Xinjun Mao, Shangwen Wang, Yuxin Zhao, Yao Lu, Jin Zhang, Zhang Zhang, Kang Yang, Yue Yu

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have automated various software engineering tasks, with benchmarks emerging to evaluate their capabilities. However, for adaptation, a critical activity during code reuse, there is no benchmark to assess LLMs' performance, leaving their practical utility in this area unclear. To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives. It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions. We hope AdaptEval can facilitate further investigation and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in code snippet adaptation, supporting their real-world applications.

Authors: Zhao Tian

Recent advances in language models (LMs) have driven significant progress in various software engineering tasks. However, existing LMs still struggle with complex programming scenarios due to limitations in data quality, model architecture, and reasoning capability. This research systematically addresses these challenges through three complementary directions: (1) improving code data quality with a code difference-guided adversarial augmentation technique (CODA) and a code denoising technique (CodeDenoise); (2) enhancing model architecture via syntax-guided code LMs (LEAM and LEAM++); and (3) advancing model reasoning with a prompting technique (muFiX) and an agent-based technique (Specine). These techniques aim to promote the practical adoption of LMs in software development and further advance intelligent software engineering.

### 5. [Extending Delta Debugging Minimization for Spectrum-Based Fault Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04689v1)

Authors: Charaka Geethal Kapugama

This paper introduces DDMIN-LOC, a technique that combines Delta Debugging Minimization (DDMIN) with Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL). It can be applied to programs taking string inputs, even when only a single failure-inducing input is available. DDMIN is an algorithm that systematically explores the minimal failure-inducing input that exposes a bug, given an initial failing input. However, it does not provide information about the faulty statements responsible for the failure. DDMIN-LOC addresses this limitation by collecting the passing and failing inputs generated during the DDMIN process and computing suspiciousness scores for program statements and predicates using SBFL algorithms. These scores are then combined to rank statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. DDMIN-LOC requires only one failing input of the buggy program, although it can be applied only to programs that take string inputs. DDMIN-LOC was evaluated on 136 programs selected from the QuixBugs and Codeflaws benchmarks using the SBFL algorithms Tarantula, Ochiai, GenProg, Jaccard and DStar. Experimental results show that DDMIN-LOC performs best with Jaccard: in most subjects, fewer than 20% executable lines need to be examined to locate the faulty statements. Moreover, in most subjects, faulty statements are ranked within the top 3 positions in all the generated test suites derived from different failing inputs.

### 6. [AVX / NEON Intrinsic Functions: When Should They Be Used?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04922v1)

Authors: Théo Boivin, Joeffrey Legaux

A cross-configuration benchmark is proposed to explore the capacities and limitations of AVX / NEON intrinsic functions in a generic context of development project, when a vectorisation strategy is required to optimise the code. The main aim is to guide developers to choose when using intrinsic functions, depending on the OS, architecture and/or available compiler. Intrinsic functions were observed highly efficient in conditional branching, with intrinsic version execution time reaching around 5% of plain code execution time. However, intrinsic functions were observed as unnecessary in many cases, as the compilers already well auto-vectorise the code.

Authors: Jingzhi Gong, Giovanni Pinna, Yixin Bian, Jie M. Zhang

Pull request (PR) descriptions generated by AI coding agents are the primary channel for communicating code changes to human reviewers. However, the alignment between these messages and the actual changes remains unexplored, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of AI agents. To fill this gap, we analyzed 23,247 agentic PRs across five agents using PR message-code inconsistency (PR-MCI). We contributed 974 manually annotated PRs, found 406 PRs (1.7%) exhibited high PR-MCI, and identified eight PR-MCI types, revealing that descriptions claiming unimplemented changes was the most common issue (45.4%). Statistical tests confirmed that high-MCI PRs had 51.7% lower acceptance rates (28.3% vs. 80.0%) and took 3.5x longer to merge (55.8 vs. 16.0 hours). Our findings suggest that unreliable PR descriptions undermine trust in AI agents, highlighting the need for PR-MCI verification mechanisms and improved PR generation to enable trustworthy human-AI collaboration.

### 1. [Why Are Some Countries More Politically Fragmented Online Than Others?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05093v1)

Authors: Yuan Zhang, Laia Castro, Frank Esser, Alexandre Bovet

Online political divisions, such as fragmentation or polarization, are a growing global concern that can foster radicalization and hinder democratic cooperation; however, not all divisions are detrimental, some reflect pluralism and healthy diversity of opinion in a democracy. While prior research has predominantly focused on polarization in the United States, there remains a limited body of research on political divides in multiparty systems, and no universal method for comparing fragmentation across countries. Moreover, cross-country comparison is rare. This study first develops a novel measure of structural political fragmentation built on multi-scale community detection and the effective branching factor. Using a dataset of 18,325 political influencers from Brazil, Spain, and the United States, we assess online fragmentation in their Twitter/X co-following networks. We compare the fragmentation of the three countries, as well as the ideological groups within each. We further investigate factors associated with the level of fragmentation in each country. We find that political fragmentation differs across countries and is asymmetric between ideological groups. Brazil is the most fragmented, with higher fragmentation among the left-wing group, while Spain and the United States exhibit similar overall levels, with the left more fragmented in Spain and the right more fragmented in the United States. Additionally, we find that social identity plays a central role in political fragmentation. A strong alignment between ideological and social identities, with minimal overlap between ideologies, tends to promote greater integration and reduce fragmentation. Our findings provide explanations for cross-national and ideological differences in political fragmentation.

### 2. [Beyond the "Truth": Investigating Election Rumors on Truth Social During the 2024 Election](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04631v1)

Authors: Etienne Casanova, R. Michael Alvarez

Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for analyzing social phenomena at scale. This paper demonstrates the value of LLMs in psychological measurement by (1) compiling the first large-scale dataset of election rumors on a niche alt-tech platform, (2) developing a multistage Rumor Detection Agent that leverages LLMs for high-precision content classification, and (3) quantifying the psychological dynamics of rumor propagation, specifically the "illusory truth effect" in a naturalistic setting. The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become "infected" within just four propagation iterations. Taken together, these results illustrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling the rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in massive, real-world datasets.

### 3. [LGTD: Local-Global Trend Decomposition for Season-Length-Free Time Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04820v1)

Authors: Chotanansub Sophaken, Thanadej Rattanakornphan, Piyanon Charoenpoonpanich, Thanapol Phungtua-eng, Chainarong Amornbunchornvej

Time series decomposition into trend, seasonal structure, and residual components is a core primitive for downstream analytics such as anomaly detection, change-point detection, and forecasting. However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.
  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.
  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade.

### 4. [Graph energy as a measure of community detectability in networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05065v1)

Authors: Lucas Böttcher, Mason A. Porter, Santo Fortunato

A key challenge in network science is the detection of communities, which are sets of nodes in a network that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of the network. A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erdős--Rényi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities.

### Machine Learning (Statistics Category)

### 1. [Convergence Rates for Learning Pseudo-Differential Operators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04473v1)

Authors: Jiaheng Chen, Daniel Sanz-Alonso

This paper establishes convergence rates for learning elliptic pseudo-differential operators, a fundamental operator class in partial differential equations and mathematical physics. In a wavelet-Galerkin framework, we formulate learning over this class as a structured infinite-dimensional regression problem with multiscale sparsity. Building on this structure, we propose a sparse, data- and computation-efficient estimator, which leverages a novel matrix compression scheme tailored to the learning task and a nested-support strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors. In addition to obtaining convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing.

### 2. [Estimating Causal Effects in Gaussian Linear SCMs with Finite Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04673v1)

Authors: Aurghya Maiti, Prateek Jain

Estimating causal effects from observational data remains a fundamental challenge in causal inference, especially in the presence of latent confounders. This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.

### 3. [Optimal Lower Bounds for Online Multicalibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05245v1)

Authors: Natalie Collina, Jiuyao Lu, Georgy Noarov, Aaron Roth

We prove tight lower bounds for online multicalibration, establishing an information-theoretic separation from marginal calibration.
  In the general setting where group functions can depend on both context and the learner's predictions, we prove an $Ω(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on expected multicalibration error using just three disjoint binary groups. This matches the upper bounds of Noarov et al. (2025) up to logarithmic factors and exceeds the $O(T^{2/3-\varepsilon})$ upper bound for marginal calibration (Dagan et al., 2025), thereby separating the two problems.
  We then turn to lower bounds for the more difficult case of group functions that may depend on context but not on the learner's predictions. In this case, we establish an $\widetildeΩ(T^{2/3})$ lower bound for online multicalibration via a $Θ(T)$-sized group family constructed using orthogonal function systems, again matching upper bounds up to logarithmic factors.

### 4. [Stochastic Deep Learning: A Probabilistic Framework for Modeling Uncertainty in Structured Temporal Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05227v1)

Authors: James Rice

I propose a novel framework that integrates stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with deep generative models to improve uncertainty quantification in machine learning applications involving structured and temporal data. This approach, termed Stochastic Latent Differential Inference (SLDI), embeds an Itô SDE in the latent space of a variational autoencoder, allowing for flexible, continuous-time modeling of uncertainty while preserving a principled mathematical foundation. The drift and diffusion terms of the SDE are parameterized by neural networks, enabling data-driven inference and generalizing classical time series models to handle irregular sampling and complex dynamic structure.
  A central theoretical contribution is the co-parameterization of the adjoint state with a dedicated neural network, forming a coupled forward-backward system that captures not only latent evolution but also gradient dynamics. I introduce a pathwise-regularized adjoint loss and analyze variance-reduced gradient flows through the lens of stochastic calculus, offering new tools for improving training stability in deep latent SDEs. My paper unifies and extends variational inference, continuous-time generative modeling, and control-theoretic optimization, providing a rigorous foundation for future developments in stochastic probabilistic machine learning.

### 5. [Forecasting the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve: A Distributionally Robust Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04608v1)

Authors: Jinjun Liu, Ming-Yen Cheng

We study U.S. Treasury yield curve forecasting under distributional uncertainty and recast forecasting as an operations research and managerial decision problem. Rather than minimizing average forecast error, the forecaster selects a decision rule that minimizes worst case expected loss over an ambiguity set of forecast error distributions. To this end, we propose a distributionally robust ensemble forecasting framework that integrates parametric factor models with high dimensional nonparametric machine learning models through adaptive forecast combinations. The framework consists of three machine learning components. First, a rolling window Factor Augmented Dynamic Nelson Siegel model captures level, slope, and curvature dynamics using principal components extracted from economic indicators. Second, Random Forest models capture nonlinear interactions among macro financial drivers and lagged Treasury yields. Third, distributionally robust forecast combination schemes aggregate heterogeneous forecasts under moment uncertainty, penalizing downside tail risk via expected shortfall and stabilizing second moment estimation through ridge regularized covariance matrices. The severity of the worst case criterion is adjustable, allowing the forecaster to regulate the trade off between robustness and statistical efficiency. Using monthly data, we evaluate out of sample forecasts across maturities and horizons from one to twelve months ahead. Adaptive combinations deliver superior performance at short horizons, while Random Forest forecasts dominate at longer horizons. Extensions to global sovereign bond yields confirm the stability and generalizability of the proposed framework.

### 6. [DeepWeightFlow: Re-Basined Flow Matching for Generating Neural Network Weights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05052v1)

Authors: Saumya Gupta, Scott Biggs, Moritz Laber, Zohair Shafi, Robin Walters, Ayan Paul

Building efficient and effective generative models for neural network weights has been a research focus of significant interest that faces challenges posed by the high-dimensional weight spaces of modern neural networks and their symmetries. Several prior generative models are limited to generating partial neural network weights, particularly for larger models, such as ResNet and ViT. Those that do generate complete weights struggle with generation speed or require finetuning of the generated models. In this work, we present DeepWeightFlow, a Flow Matching model that operates directly in weight space to generate diverse and high-accuracy neural network weights for a variety of architectures, neural network sizes, and data modalities. The neural networks generated by DeepWeightFlow do not require fine-tuning to perform well and can scale to large networks. We apply Git Re-Basin and TransFusion for neural network canonicalization in the context of generative weight models to account for the impact of neural network permutation symmetries and to improve generation efficiency for larger model sizes. The generated networks excel at transfer learning, and ensembles of hundreds of neural networks can be generated in minutes, far exceeding the efficiency of diffusion-based methods. DeepWeightFlow models pave the way for more efficient and scalable generation of diverse sets of neural networks.

### 7. [A Generalized Adaptive Joint Learning Framework for High-Dimensional Time-Varying Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04499v1)

Authors: Baolin Chen, Mengfei Ran

In modern biomedical and econometric studies, longitudinal processes are often characterized by complex time-varying associations and abrupt regime shifts that are shared across correlated outcomes. Standard functional data analysis (FDA) methods, which prioritize smoothness, often fail to capture these dynamic structural features, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This article introduces Adaptive Joint Learning (AJL), a regularization framework designed to simultaneously perform functional variable selection and structural changepoint detection in multivariate time-varying coefficient models. We propose a convex optimization procedure that synergizes adaptive group-wise penalization with fused regularization, effectively borrowing strength across multiple outcomes to enhance estimation efficiency. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the estimator in the ultra-high-dimensional regime (p >> n), establishing non-asymptotic error bounds and proving that AJL achieves the oracle property--performing as well as if the true active set and changepoint locations were known a priori. A key theoretical contribution is the explicit handling of approximation bias via undersmoothing conditions to ensure valid asymptotic inference. The proposed method is validated through comprehensive simulations and an application to Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) data. The analysis uncovers synchronized phase transitions in disease progression and identifies a parsimonious set of time-varying prognostic markers.

### 8. [Learning Mixture Models via Efficient High-dimensional Sparse Fourier Transforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05157v1)

Authors: Alkis Kalavasis, Pravesh K. Kothari, Shuchen Li, Manolis Zampetakis

In this work, we give a ${\rm poly}(d,k)$ time and sample algorithm for efficiently learning the parameters of a mixture of $k$ spherical distributions in $d$ dimensions. Unlike all previous methods, our techniques apply to heavy-tailed distributions and include examples that do not even have finite covariances. Our method succeeds whenever the cluster distributions have a characteristic function with sufficiently heavy tails. Such distributions include the Laplace distribution but crucially exclude Gaussians.
  All previous methods for learning mixture models relied implicitly or explicitly on the low-degree moments. Even for the case of Laplace distributions, we prove that any such algorithm must use super-polynomially many samples. Our method thus adds to the short list of techniques that bypass the limitations of the method of moments.
  Somewhat surprisingly, our algorithm does not require any minimum separation between the cluster means. This is in stark contrast to spherical Gaussian mixtures where a minimum $\ell_2$-separation is provably necessary even information-theoretically [Regev and Vijayaraghavan '17]. Our methods compose well with existing techniques and allow obtaining ''best of both worlds" guarantees for mixtures where every component either has a heavy-tailed characteristic function or has a sub-Gaussian tail with a light-tailed characteristic function.
  Our algorithm is based on a new approach to learning mixture models via efficient high-dimensional sparse Fourier transforms. We believe that this method will find more applications to statistical estimation. As an example, we give an algorithm for consistent robust mean estimation against noise-oblivious adversaries, a model practically motivated by the literature on multiple hypothesis testing. It was formally proposed in a recent Master's thesis by one of the authors, and has already inspired follow-up works.

### 9. [ROOFS: RObust biOmarker Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05151v1)

Authors: Anastasiia Bakhmach, Paul Dufossé, Andrea Vaglio, Florence Monville, Laurent Greillier, Fabrice Barlési, Sébastien Benzekry

Feature selection (FS) is essential for biomarker discovery and in the analysis of biomedical datasets. However, challenges such as high-dimensional feature space, low sample size, multicollinearity, and missing values make FS non-trivial. Moreover, FS performances vary across datasets and predictive tasks. We propose roofs, a Python package available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/compo/roofs, designed to help researchers in the choice of FS method adapted to their problem. Roofs benchmarks multiple FS methods on the user's data and generates reports that summarize a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including downstream predictive performance estimated using optimism correction, stability, reliability of individual features, and true positive and false positive rates assessed on semi-synthetic data with a simulated outcome. We demonstrate the utility of roofs on data from the PIONeeR clinical trial, aimed at identifying predictors of resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy in lung cancer. The PIONeeR dataset contained 374 multi-source blood and tumor biomarkers from 435 patients. A reduced subset of 214 features was obtained through iterative variance inflation factor pre-filtering. Of the 34 FS methods gathered in roofs, we evaluated 23 in combination with 11 classifiers (253 models in total) and identified a filter based on the union of Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate-adjusted p-values from t-test and logistic regression as the optimal approach, outperforming other methods including the widely used LASSO. We conclude that comprehensive benchmarking with roofs has the potential to improve the robustness and reproducibility of FS discoveries and increase the translational value of clinical models.

### 10. [CAOS: Conformal Aggregation of One-Shot Predictors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05219v1)

Authors: Maja Waldron

One-shot prediction enables rapid adaptation of pretrained foundation models to new tasks using only one labeled example, but lacks principled uncertainty quantification. While conformal prediction provides finite-sample coverage guarantees, standard split conformal methods are inefficient in the one-shot setting due to data splitting and reliance on a single predictor. We propose Conformal Aggregation of One-Shot Predictors (CAOS), a conformal framework that adaptively aggregates multiple one-shot predictors and uses a leave-one-out calibration scheme to fully exploit scarce labeled data. Despite violating classical exchangeability assumptions, we prove that CAOS achieves valid marginal coverage using a monotonicity-based argument. Experiments on one-shot facial landmarking and RAFT text classification tasks show that CAOS produces substantially smaller prediction sets than split conformal baselines while maintaining reliable coverage.

### 1. [Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Classification using Machine Learning Techniques for Nagamese Language - A Low-resource Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01256v1)

Authors: Ekha Morang, Surhoni A. Ngullie, Sashienla Longkumer, Teisovi Angami

The Nagamese language, a.k.a Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified creole language developed primarily as a means of communication in trade between the people from Nagaland and people from Assam in the north-east India. Substantial amount of work in sentiment analysis has been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no work has been done in Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt on sentiment analysis and emotion classification for the Nagamese Language. The aim of this work is to detect sentiments in terms of polarity (positive, negative and neutral) and basic emotions contained in textual content of Nagamese language. We build sentiment polarity lexicon of 1,195 nagamese words and use these to build features along with additional features for supervised machine learning techniques using Na"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.
  Keywords: Nagamese, NLP, sentiment analysis, machine learning

### 2. [Generative Adversarial Gumbel MCTS for Abstract Visual Composition Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01242v1)

Authors: Zirui Zhao, Boye Niu, David Hsu, Wee Sun Lee

We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.

### 3. [First, do NOHARM: towards clinically safe large language models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01241v1)

Authors: David Wu, Fateme Nateghi Haredasht, Saloni Kumar Maharaj, Priyank Jain, Jessica Tran, Matthew Gwiazdon, Arjun Rustagi, Jenelle Jindal, Jacob M. Koshy, Vinay Kadiyala, Anup Agarwal, Bassman Tappuni, Brianna French, Sirus Jesudasen, Christopher V. Cosgriff, Rebanta Chakraborty, Jillian Caldwell, Susan Ziolkowski, David J. Iberri, Robert Diep, Rahul S. Dalal, Kira L. Newman, Kristin Galetta, J. Carl Pallais, Nancy Wei, Kathleen M. Buchheit, David I. Hong, Ernest Y. Lee, Allen Shih, Vartan Pahalyants, Tamara B. Kaplan, Vishnu Ravi, Sarita Khemani, April S. Liang, Daniel Shirvani, Advait Patil, Nicholas Marshall, Kanav Chopra, Joel Koh, Adi Badhwar, Liam G. McCoy, David J. H. Wu, Yingjie Weng, Sumant Ranji, Kevin Schulman, Nigam H. Shah, Jason Hom, Arnold Milstein, Adam Rodman, Jonathan H. Chen, Ethan Goh

Large language models (LLMs) are routinely used by physicians and patients for medical advice, yet their clinical safety profiles remain poorly characterized. We present NOHARM (Numerous Options Harm Assessment for Risk in Medicine), a benchmark using 100 real primary-care-to-specialist consultation cases to measure harm frequency and severity from LLM-generated medical recommendations. NOHARM covers 10 specialties, with 12,747 expert annotations for 4,249 clinical management options. Across 31 LLMs, severe harm occurs in up to 22.2% (95% CI 21.6-22.8%) of cases, with harms of omission accounting for 76.6% (95% CI 76.4-76.8%) of errors. Safety performance is only moderately correlated (r = 0.61-0.64) with existing AI and medical knowledge benchmarks. The best models outperform generalist physicians on safety (mean difference 9.7%, 95% CI 7.0-12.5%), and a diverse multi-agent approach reduces harm compared to solo models (mean difference 8.0%, 95% CI 4.0-12.1%). Therefore, despite strong performance on existing evaluations, widely used AI models can produce severely harmful medical advice at nontrivial rates, underscoring clinical safety as a distinct performance dimension necessitating explicit measurement.

### 4. [Proactive Agentic Whiteboards: Enhancing Diagrammatic Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01234v1)

Authors: Suveen Ellawala, Sashenka Gamage, Dinithi Dissanayake

Educators frequently rely on diagrams to explain complex concepts during lectures, yet creating clear and complete visual representations in real time while simultaneously speaking can be cognitively demanding. Incomplete or unclear diagrams may hinder student comprehension, as learners must mentally reconstruct missing information while following the verbal explanation. Inspired by advances in code completion tools, we introduce DrawDash, an AI-powered whiteboard assistant that proactively completes and refines educational diagrams through multimodal understanding. DrawDash adopts a TAB-completion interaction model: it listens to spoken explanations, detects intent, and dynamically suggests refinements that can be accepted with a single keystroke. We demonstrate DrawDash across four diverse teaching scenarios, spanning topics from computer science and web development to biology. This work represents an early exploration into reducing instructors' cognitive load and improving diagram-based pedagogy through real-time, speech-driven visual assistance, and concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for formal classroom evaluation.

### 5. [Unsupervised decoding of encoded reasoning using language model interpretability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01222v1)

Authors: Ching Fang, Samuel Marks

As large language models become increasingly capable, there is growing concern that they may develop reasoning processes that are encoded or hidden from human oversight. To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate such encoded reasoning, we construct a controlled testbed by fine-tuning a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining intelligible English outputs. We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood. Our work provides an initial framework for evaluating interpretability methods against models that reason in non-human-readable formats, contributing to the broader challenge of maintaining oversight over increasingly capable AI systems.

### 6. [Neural Network Optimal Power Flow via Energy Gradient Flow and Unified Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01219v1)

Authors: Xuezhi Liu

Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and planning, aiming to minimize generation costs while satisfying physical constraints such as power flow equations, generator limits, and voltage limits. Traditional OPF solving methods typically employ iterative optimization algorithms (such as interior point methods, sequential quadratic programming, etc.), with limitations including low computational efficiency, initial value sensitivity, and low batch computation efficiency. Most existing deep learning-based OPF methods rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-solving large numbers of cases, and have difficulty guaranteeing physical consistency. This paper proposes an Optimal Power Flow solving method based on neural network dynamics and energy gradient flow, transforming OPF problems into energy minimization problems. By constructing an energy function to measure the degree of deviation from the constraint manifold, and guiding networks to learn optimal solutions that simultaneously satisfy power flow constraints and minimize costs through gradient flow. Neural networks are trained unsupervised by directly minimizing physical residuals, requiring no labeled data, achieving true "end-to-end" physics-constrained learning.

### 7. [Beyond Greenfield: AI-Driven Productivity in Documentation and Brownfield Engineering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01155v1)

Authors: Krishna Kumaar Sharma

Brownfield engineering work involving legacy systems, incomplete documentation, and fragmented architectural knowledge poses unique challenges for the effective use of large language models (LLMs). Prior research has largely focused on greenfield or synthetic tasks, leaving a gap in structured workflows for complex, context-heavy environments. This paper introduces the Discover-Define-Deliver (D3) Framework, a disciplined LLM-assisted workflow that combines role-separated prompting strategies with applied best practices for navigating ambiguity in brownfield systems. The framework incorporates a dual-agent prompting architecture in which a Builder model generates candidate outputs and a Reviewer model provides structured critique to improve reliability. I conducted an exploratory survey study with 52 software practitioners who applied the D3 workflow to real-world engineering tasks such as legacy system exploration, documentation reconstruction, and architectural refactoring. Respondents reported perceived improvements in task clarity, documentation quality, and cognitive load, along with self-estimated productivity gains. In this exploratory study, participants reported a weighted average productivity improvement of 26.9%, reduced cognitive load for approximately 77% of participants, and reduced rework for 83% during the Define phase. As these findings are self-reported and not derived from controlled experiments, they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence of practitioner sentiment rather than causal effects. The results highlight both the potential and limitations of structured LLM workflows for legacy engineering systems and motivate future controlled evaluations.

### 8. [Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01987v1)

Authors: Suzan Ece Ada, Georg Martius, Emre Ugur, Erhan Oztop

Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.

### 9. [From Atomic to Composite: Reinforcement Learning Enables Generalization in Complementary Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01970v1)

Authors: Sitao Cheng, Xunjian Yin, Ruiwen Zhou, Yuxuan Li, Xinyi Wang, Liangming Pan, William Yang Wang, Victor Zhong

The mechanism by which RL contributes to reasoning capabilities-whether it incentivizes the synthesis of new skills or merely amplifies existing behaviors-remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks.

### 10. [Unifying Sign and Magnitude for Optimizing Deep Vision Networks via ThermoLion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01881v1)

Authors: Ahmed Nebli

The training of deep vision models is fundamentally a signal recovery problem amidst high-dimensional stochastic noise. Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a "low-bit" exploration phase and a "high-precision" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories. Empirical benchmarks across 12 diverse vision datasets (including CIFAR, SVHN, and GTSRB) demonstrate that ThermoLion serves as a hyperparameter-free generalist, surpassing both AdamW and Lion in convergence speed and terminal accuracy without architecture-specific tuning.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [A Low-Cost Reliable Racetrack Cache Based on Data Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01915v1)

Authors: Elham Cheshmikhani, Fateme Shokouhinia, Hamed Farbeh

SRAM-based cache memory faces several scalability limitations in deep nanoscale technologies, e.g., high leakage current, low cell stability, and low density. Emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies have received lots of attention in recent years, where Racetrack Memory (RTM) is among the most promising ones. RTM has the highest density among all NVMs and its access performance is comparable to SRAM technology. Therefore, RTM is a suitable alternative for SRAM in the Last-Level Caches (LLCs). Despite all its benefits, RTM confronts different reliability challenges due to the stochastic behavior of its storage element and highly error-prone data shifting, leading to a high probability of multiple-bit errors. Conventional Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are either incapable of tolerating multiple-bit errors or require a large amount of extra storage for check bits. This paper proposes taking advantage of value locality for compressing data blocks and freeing up a large fraction of cache blocks for storing data redundancy of strong ECCs. Utilizing the proposed scheme, a large majority of cache blocks are protected by strong ECCs to tolerate multiple-bit errors without any storage overhead. The evaluation using gem5 full-system simulator demonstrates that the proposed scheme enhances the mean-time-to-failure of the cache by an average of 11.3x with less than 1% hardware and performance overhead.

### 2. [RoMe: Row Granularity Access Memory System for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01541v1)

Authors: Hwayong Nam, Seungmin Baek, Jumin Kim, Michael Jaemin Kim, Jung Ho Ahn

Modern HBM-based memory systems have evolved over generations while retaining cache line granularity accesses. Preserving this fine granularity necessitated the introduction of bank groups and pseudo channels. These structures expand timing parameters and control overhead, significantly increasing memory controller scheduling complexity. Large language models (LLMs) now dominate deep learning workloads, streaming contiguous data blocks ranging from several kilobytes to megabytes per operation. In a conventional HBM-based memory system, these transfers are fragmented into hundreds of 32B cache line transactions. This forces the memory controller to employ unnecessarily intricate scheduling, leading to growing inefficiency.
  To address this problem, we propose RoMe. RoMe accesses DRAM at row granularity and removes columns, bank groups, and pseudo channels from the memory interface. This design simplifies memory scheduling, thereby requiring fewer pins per channel. The freed pins are aggregated to form additional channels, increasing overall bandwidth by 12.5% with minimal extra pins. RoMe demonstrates how memory scheduling logic can be significantly simplified for representative LLM workloads, and presents an alternative approach for next-generation HBM-based memory systems achieving increased bandwidth with minimal hardware overhead.

### 3. [Tangram: Accelerating Serverless LLM Loading through GPU Memory Reuse and Affinity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01357v1)

Authors: Wenbin Zhu, Zhaoyan Shen, Zili Shao, Hongjun Dai, Feng Chen

Serverless Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a cost-effective solution for deploying AI services by enabling a 'pay-as-you-go' pricing model through GPU resource sharing. However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods.

### 4. [Leveraging Recurrent Patterns in Graph Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01193v1)

Authors: Masoud Rahimi, Sébastien Le Beux

Graph accelerators have emerged as a promising solution for processing large-scale sparse graphs, leveraging the in-situ compu-tation of ReRAM-based crossbars to maximize computational efficiency. However, existing designs suffer from memristor access overhead due to the large number of graph partitions. This leads to increased execution time, higher energy consumption, and re-duced circuit lifetime. This paper proposes a graph processing method that minimizes memristor write operations by identifying frequent subgraph patterns and assigning them to graph engines, referred to as static, allowing most subgraphs to be processed without a need for crossbar reconfiguration. Experimental results show speed up to 2.38x speedup and 7.23x energy savings com-pared to state-of-the-art accelerators. Furthermore, our method extends the circuit lifetime by 2x compared to state-of-the-art ReRAM graph accelerators.

### 5. [Differentiable Weightless Controllers: Learning Logic Circuits for Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01467v1)

Authors: Fabian Kresse, Christoph H. Lampert

We investigate whether continuous-control policies can be represented and learned as discrete logic circuits instead of continuous neural networks. We introduce Differentiable Weightless Controllers (DWCs), a symbolic-differentiable architecture that maps real-valued observations to actions using thermometer-encoded inputs, sparsely connected boolean lookup-table layers, and lightweight action heads. DWCs can be trained end-to-end by gradient-based techniques, yet compile directly into FPGA-compatible circuits with few- or even single-clock-cycle latency and nanojoule-level energy cost per action. Across five MuJoCo benchmarks, including high-dimensional Humanoid, DWCs achieve returns competitive with weight-based policies (full precision or quantized neural networks), matching performance on four tasks and isolating network capacity as the key limiting factor on HalfCheetah. Furthermore, DWCs exhibit structurally sparse and interpretable connectivity patterns, enabling a direct inspection of which input thresholds influence control decisions.

### 6. [hls4ml: A Flexible, Open-Source Platform for Deep Learning Acceleration on Reconfigurable Hardware](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01463v1)

Authors: Jan-Frederik Schulte, Benjamin Ramhorst, Chang Sun, Jovan Mitrevski, Nicolò Ghielmetti, Enrico Lupi, Dimitrios Danopoulos, Vladimir Loncar, Javier Duarte, David Burnette, Lauri Laatu, Stylianos Tzelepis, Konstantinos Axiotis, Quentin Berthet, Haoyan Wang, Paul White, Suleyman Demirsoy, Marco Colombo, Thea Aarrestad, Sioni Summers, Maurizio Pierini, Giuseppe Di Guglielmo, Jennifer Ngadiuba, Javier Campos, Ben Hawks, Abhijith Gandrakota, Farah Fahim, Nhan Tran, George Constantinides, Zhiqiang Que, Wayne Luk, Alexander Tapper, Duc Hoang, Noah Paladino, Philip Harris, Bo-Cheng Lai, Manuel Valentin, Ryan Forelli, Seda Ogrenci, Lino Gerlach, Rian Flynn, Mia Liu, Daniel Diaz, Elham Khoda, Melissa Quinnan, Russell Solares, Santosh Parajuli, Mark Neubauer, Christian Herwig, Ho Fung Tsoi, Dylan Rankin, Shih-Chieh Hsu, Scott Hauck

We present hls4ml, a free and open-source platform that translates machine learning (ML) models from modern deep learning frameworks into high-level synthesis (HLS) code that can be integrated into full designs for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). With its flexible and modular design, hls4ml supports a large number of deep learning frameworks and can target HLS compilers from several vendors, including Vitis HLS, Intel oneAPI and Catapult HLS. Together with a wider eco-system for software-hardware co-design, hls4ml has enabled the acceleration of ML inference in a wide range of commercial and scientific applications where low latency, resource usage, and power consumption are critical. In this paper, we describe the structure and functionality of the hls4ml platform. The overarching design considerations for the generated HLS code are discussed, together with selected performance results.

### 7. [IVE: An Accelerator for Single-Server Private Information Retrieval Using Versatile Processing Elements](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01574v1)

Authors: Sangpyo Kim, Hyesung Ji, Jongmin Kim, Wonseok Choi, Jaiyoung Park, Jung Ho Ahn

Private information retrieval (PIR) is an essential cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving applications, enabling a client to retrieve a record from a server's database without revealing which record was requested. Single-server PIR based on homomorphic encryption has particularly gained immense attention for its ease of deployment and reduced trust assumptions. However, single-server PIR remains impractical due to its high computational and memory bandwidth demands. Specifically, reading the entirety of large databases from storage, such as SSDs, severely limits its performance. To address this, we propose IVE, an accelerator for single-server PIR with a systematic extension that enables practical retrieval from large databases using DRAM. Recent advances in DRAM capacity allow PIR for large databases to be served entirely from DRAM, removing its dependence on storage bandwidth. Although the memory bandwidth bottleneck still remains, multi-client batching effectively amortizes database access costs across concurrent requests to improve throughput. However, client-specific data remains a bottleneck, whose bandwidth requirements ultimately limits performance. IVE overcomes this by employing a large on-chip scratchpad with an operation scheduling algorithm that maximizes data reuse, further boosting throughput. Additionally, we introduce sysNTTU, a versatile functional unit that enhances area efficiency without sacrificing performance. We also propose a heterogeneous memory system architecture, which enables a linear scaling of database sizes without a throughput degradation. Consequently, IVE achieves up to 1,275x higher throughput compared to prior PIR hardware solutions.

### 8. [A Systematic Characterization of LLM Inference on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01644v1)

Authors: Haonan Wang, Xuxin Xiao, Mingyu Yan, Zhuoyuan Zhu, Dengke Han, Duo Wang, Wenming Li, Xiaochun Ye, Cunchen Hu, Hongyang Chen, Guangyu Sun

This work presents a systematic characterization of Large Language Model (LLM) inference to address fragmented understanding. Through comprehensive experiments, we establish a four-dimensional analytical framework: (1) Two-Phase Heterogeneity Observation; (2) Microarchitectural Root Cause Analysis; (3) System Scaling Principles; and (4) Emerging Paradigm Boundaries. Our investigation progresses systematically from observation to foresight: identifying performance phenomena, revealing hardware causes, validating system behavior, and exploring new paradigms. This study not only consolidates a reliable empirical foundation for existing research but also provides new discoveries and practical optimization guidance for LLM inference.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [Samplability makes learning easier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01276v1)

Authors: Guy Blanc, Caleb Koch, Jane Lange, Carmen Strassle, Li-Yang Tan

The standard definition of PAC learning (Valiant 1984) requires learners to succeed under all distributions -- even ones that are intractable to sample from. This stands in contrast to samplable PAC learning (Blum, Furst, Kearns, and Lipton 1993), where learners only have to succeed under samplable distributions. We study this distinction and show that samplable PAC substantially expands the power of efficient learners.
  We first construct a concept class that requires exponential sample complexity in standard PAC but is learnable with polynomial sample complexity in samplable PAC. We then lift this statistical separation to the computational setting and obtain a separation relative to a random oracle. Our proofs center around a new complexity primitive, explicit evasive sets, that we introduce and study. These are sets for which membership is easy to determine but are extremely hard to sample from.
  Our results extend to the online setting to similarly show how its landscape changes when the adversary is assumed to be efficient instead of computationally unbounded.

### 2. [A List of Complexity Bounds for Property Testing by Quantum Sample-to-Query Lifting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01971v1)

Authors: Kean Chen, Qisheng Wang, Zhicheng Zhang

Quantum sample-to-query lifting, a relation between quantum sample complexity and quantum query complexity presented in Wang and Zhang (SIAM J. Comput. 2025), was significantly strengthened by Tang, Wright, and Zhandry (2025) to the case of state-preparation oracles. In this paper, we compile a list of quantum lower and upper bounds for property testing that are obtained by quantum sample-to-query lifting. The problems of interest include testing properties of probability distributions and quantum states, such as entropy and closeness. This collection contains new results, as well as new proofs of known bounds. In total, we present 49 complexity bounds, where 41 are new and 18 are (near-)optimal.

### 3. [Multiquadratic Sum-of-Squares Lower Bounds Imply VNC$^1$ $\neq$ VNP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01227v1)

Authors: Benjamin Rossman, Davidson Zhu

The \emph{sum-of-squares (SoS) complexity} of a $d$-multiquadratic polynomial $f$ (quadratic in each of $d$ blocks of $n$ variables) is the minimum $s$ such that $f = \sum_{i=1}^s g_i^2$ with each $g_i$ $d$-multilinear. In the case $d=2$, Hrubeš, Wigderson and Yehudayoff (2011) showed that an $n^{1+Ω(1)}$ lower bound on the SoS complexity of explicit biquadratic polynomials implies an exponential lower bound for non-commutative arithmetic circuits. In this paper, we establish an analogous connection between general \emph{multiquadratic sum-of-squares} and \emph{commutative arithmetic formulas}. Specifically, we show that an $n^{d-o(\log d)}$ lower bound on the SoS complexity of explicit $d$-multiquadratic polynomials, for any $d = d(n)$ with $ω(1) \le d(n) \le O(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$, would separate the algebraic complexity classes VNC$^1$ and VNP.

### 1. [GPU-native Embedding of Complex Geometries in Adaptive Octree Grids Applied to the Lattice Boltzmann Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01251v1)

Authors: Khodr Jaber, Ebenezer E. Essel, Pierre E. Sullivan

Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) reduces computational costs in CFD by concentrating resolution where needed, but efficiently embedding complex, non-aligned geometries on GPUs remains challenging. We present a GPU-native algorithm for incorporating stationary triangle-mesh geometries into block-structured forest-of-octrees grids, performing both solid voxelization and automated near-wall refinement entirely on the device. The method employs local ray casting accelerated by a hierarchy of spatial bins, leveraging efficient grid-block traversal to eliminate the need for index orderings and hash tables commonly used in CPU pipelines, and enabling coalesced memory access without CPU-GPU synchronization. A flattened lookup table of cut-link distances between fluid and solid cells is constructed to support accurate interpolated bounce-back boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We implement this approach as an extension of the AGAL framework for GPU-based AMR and benchmark the geometry module using the Stanford Bunny (112K triangles) and XYZ RGB Dragon (7.2M triangles) models from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository. The extended solver is validated for external flows past a circular/square cylinder (2D, $Re = 100$), and a sphere (3D, $\text{Re}\in\{10, 15, 20\}$). Results demonstrate that geometry handling and interpolation impose modest overhead while delivering accurate force predictions and stable near-wall resolution on adaptive Cartesian grids. The approach is general and applicable to other explicit solvers requiring GPU-resident geometry embedding.

### 2. [Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Mixed Integer Linear Programming: Explainable Graph-Based Instance Space Analysis in Air Transportation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01698v1)

Authors: Artur Guerra Rosa, Felipe Tavares Loureiro, Marcus Vinicius Santos da Silva, Andréia Elizabeth Silva Barros, Silvia Araújo dos Reis, Victor Rafael Rezende Celestino

This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to address complex optimization challenges in air transportation with explainability. The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.

### Computational Geometry

### 1. [AUnified Framework for N-Dimensional Visualization and Simulation: Implementation and Evaluation including 4D Boolean](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01501v1)

Authors: Hirohito Arai

This study proposes a unified framework for simulation and visualization of intuitive exploration of phenomena in N-dimensional space. While specialized libraries offer powerful geometric algorithms, they typically lack integrated environments for interactive trial and error, creating a barrier for researchers. The contribution of this research is the integration of Quickhull-based mesh generation, visualization via hyperplane slicing, and computationally expensive Boolean operations into a single, extensible platform, while maintaining interactivity. To validate its effectiveness, this paper presents a 4-dimensional implementation and introduces a new interaction design, termed `High-Dimensional FPS,' to enable intuitive high-dimensional exploration. Furthermore, as a case study to demonstrate the framework's high extensibility, I also integrated a non-rigid body physics simulation based on Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD). Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving real-time rendering (80 fps) of complex 4D objects and completing Boolean operations within seconds in a standard PC environment. By providing an accessible and interactive platform, this work lowers the entry barrier for high-dimensional simulation research and enhances its potential for applications in education and entertainment.

### 2. [The Hidden Cost of Straight Lines: Quantifying Misallocation Risk in Voronoi-based Service Area Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01795v1)

Voronoi tessellations are standard in spatial planning for assigning service areas based on Euclidean proximity, underpinning regulatory frameworks like the proximity principle in waste management. However, in regions with complex topography, Euclidean distance poorly approximates functional accessibility, causing misallocations that undermine efficiency and equity. This paper develops a probabilistic framework to quantify misallocation risk by modeling travel distances as random scaling of Euclidean distances and deriving incorrect assignment probability as a function of local Voronoi geometry. Using plant-municipality observations (n=383) in Extremadura, Spain (41,635 km2), we demonstrate that the Log-Normal distribution provides best relative fit among alternatives (K-S statistic=0.110). Validation reveals 15.4% of municipalities are misallocated, consistent with the theoretical prediction interval (52-65 municipalities at 95% confidence). Our framework achieves 95% agreement with complex spatial models at O(n) complexity. Poor absolute fit of global distributions (p-values<0.01) reflects diverse topography (elevation 200-2,400m), motivating spatial stratification. Sensitivity analysis validates the fitted dispersion parameter (s=0.093) for predicting observed misallocation. We provide a calibration protocol requiring only 30-100 pilot samples per zone, enabling rapid risk assessment without full network analysis. This establishes the first probabilistic framework for Voronoi misallocation risk with practical guidelines emphasizing spatial heterogeneity and context-dependent calibration.

### 1. [From Atomic to Composite: Reinforcement Learning Enables Generalization in Complementary Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01970v1)

Authors: Sitao Cheng, Xunjian Yin, Ruiwen Zhou, Yuxuan Li, Xinyi Wang, Liangming Pan, William Yang Wang, Victor Zhong

The mechanism by which RL contributes to reasoning capabilities-whether it incentivizes the synthesis of new skills or merely amplifies existing behaviors-remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks.

### 2. [Latent Debate: A Surrogate Framework for Interpreting LLM Thinking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01909v1)

Authors: Lihu Chen, Xiang Yin, Francesca Toni

Understanding the internal thinking process of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the cause of hallucinations remains a key challenge. To this end, we introduce latent debate, a novel framework for interpreting model predictions through the lens of implicit internal arguments. Unlike the current work of self-consistency and multi-agent debate, which relies on explicit debates among multiple answers or multiple models, latent debate captures the hidden supporting and attacking signals that arise within a single model during a single inference. We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps.

### 3. [Cross-Lingual Interleaving for Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01865v1)

Authors: Adel Moumen, Guangzhi Sun, Philip C. Woodland

Spoken Language Models (SLMs) aim to learn linguistic competence directly from speech using discrete units, widening access to Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies for languages with limited written resources. However, progress has been largely English-centric due to scarce spoken evaluation benchmarks and training data, making cross-lingual learning difficult. We present a cross-lingual interleaving method that mixes speech tokens across languages without textual supervision. We also release an EN-FR training dataset, TinyStories (~42k hours), together with EN-FR spoken StoryCloze and TopicCloze benchmarks for cross-lingual semantic evaluation, both synthetically generated using GPT-4. On 360M and 1B SLMs under matched training-token budgets, interleaving improves monolingual semantic accuracy, enables robust cross-lingual continuation, and strengthens cross-lingual hidden-state alignment. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-lingual interleaving is a simple, scalable route to building multilingual SLMs that understand and converse across languages. All resources will be made open-source to support reproducibility.

Authors: Cheng Gao, Huimin Chen, Chaojun Xiao, Zhiyi Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations -- plausible but factually incorrect outputs -- undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.

### 5. [Beware of Reasoning Overconfidence: Pitfalls in the Reasoning Process for Multi-solution Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01725v1)

Authors: Jiannan Guan, Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Dengyun Peng, Jinhao Liu, Liangyu Huo, Jian Xie, Wanxiang Che

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning tasks requiring a single correct answer, but they perform poorly in multi-solution tasks that require generating comprehensive and diverse answers. We attribute this limitation to \textbf{reasoning overconfidence}: a tendency to express undue certainty in an incomplete solution set. To examine the effect, we introduce \textit{MuSoBench}, a benchmark of multi-solution problems. Experiments show that the conventional short chain-of-thought (Short-CoT) prompting paradigm exhibits pronounced overconfidence, whereas the emerging long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) approach mitigates it through iterative exploration and self-reflection. We further characterise observable behaviours and influential factors. To probe the underlying cause, we propose the \textbf{cognitive-rigidity hypothesis}, which posits that overconfidence arises when the reasoning process prematurely converges on a narrow set of thought paths. An attention-entropy analysis offers preliminary support for this view. These findings provide tools for assessing the completeness of LLM reasoning and highlight the need to move evaluation beyond single-answer accuracy toward comprehensive exploration.

### 6. [Self-Supervised Borrowing Detection on Multilingual Wordlists](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01713v1)

Authors: Tim Wientzek

This paper presents a fully self-supervised approach to borrowing detection in multilingual wordlists. The method combines two sources of information: PMI similarities based on a global correspondence model and a lightweight contrastive component trained on phonetic feature vectors. It further includes an automatic procedure for selecting decision thresholds without requiring labeled data. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PMI alone already improves over existing string similarity measures such as NED and SCA, and that the combined similarity performs on par with or better than supervised baselines. An ablation study highlights the importance of character encoding, temperature settings and augmentation strategies. The approach scales to datasets of different sizes, works without manual supervision and is provided with a command-line tool that allows researchers to conduct their own studies.

### 7. [LEC: Linear Expectation Constraints for False-Discovery Control in Selective Prediction and Routing Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01556v1)

Authors: Zhiyuan Wang, Aniri, Tianlong Chen, Yue Zhang, Heng Tao Shen, Xiaoshuang Shi, Kaidi Xu

Large language models (LLMs) often generate unreliable answers, while heuristic uncertainty methods fail to fully distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, causing users to accept erroneous answers without statistical guarantees. We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model.

### 8. [LPCD: Unified Framework from Layer-Wise to Submodule Quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01546v1)

Authors: Yuma Ichikawa, Yudai Fujimoto, Akira Sakai

Post-training quantization (PTQ) aims to preserve model-level behavior; however, most methods focus on individual linear layers. Even recent extensions, such as QEP and LoaQ, which mitigate error propagation or target specific submodules, still rely on layer-wise formulations and fail to capture the behavior of larger submodules. We introduce Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD), a unified framework that extends PTQ beyond layers by optimizing relaxed objectives across arbitrary submodules and projecting the solutions with layer-wise quantizers. LPCD generalizes existing methods and provides a principled approach to quantizing complex submodules while maintaining the efficiency and compatibility of layer-wise PTQ pipelines. Across diverse LLM architectures and bit-widths, LPCD-based submodule quantization consistently enhances both layer-wise PTQ methods and existing submodule approaches.

### 9. [Enhancing BERT Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Analysis in Lower-Resourced Languages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01460v1)

Authors: Jozef Kubík, Marek Šuppa, Martin Takáč

Limited data for low-resource languages typically yield weaker language models (LMs). Since pre-training is compute-intensive, it is more pragmatic to target improvements during fine-tuning. In this work, we examine the use of Active Learning (AL) methods augmented by structured data selection strategies which we term 'Active Learning schedulers', to boost the fine-tuning process with a limited amount of training data. We connect the AL to data clustering and propose an integrated fine-tuning pipeline that systematically combines AL, clustering, and dynamic data selection schedulers to enhance model's performance. Experiments in the Slovak, Maltese, Icelandic and Turkish languages show that the use of clustering during the fine-tuning phase together with AL scheduling can simultaneously produce annotation savings up to 30% and performance improvements up to four F1 score points, while also providing better fine-tuning stability.

Authors: Xabier de Zuazo, Ibon Saratxaga, Eva Navas

We present Conformer-based decoders for the LibriBrain 2025 PNPL competition, targeting two foundational MEG tasks: Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification. Our approach adapts a compact Conformer to raw 306-channel MEG signals, with a lightweight convolutional projection layer and task-specific heads. For Speech Detection, a MEG-oriented SpecAugment provided a first exploration of MEG-specific augmentation. For Phoneme Classification, we used inverse-square-root class weighting and a dynamic grouping loader to handle 100-sample averaged examples. In addition, a simple instance-level normalization proved critical to mitigate distribution shifts on the holdout split. Using the official Standard track splits and F1-macro for model selection, our best systems achieved 88.9% (Speech) and 65.8% (Phoneme) on the leaderboard, surpassing the competition baselines and ranking within the top-10 in both tasks. For further implementation details, the technical documentation, source code, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/neural2speech/libribrain-experiments.

Authors: Harish Yadav, Vikas Maurya, Abhilash Jindal, Vireshwar Kumar

Android employs a permission framework that empowers users to either accept or deny sharing their private data (for example, location) with an app. However, many apps tend to crash when they are denied permission, leaving users no choice but to allow access to their data in order to use the app. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive and robust user data spoofing system, WhiteLie, that can spoof a variety of user data and feed it to target apps. Additionally, it detects privacy-violating behaviours, automatically responding by supplying spoofed data instead of the user's real data, without crashing or disrupting the apps. Unlike prior approaches, WhiteLie requires neither device rooting nor altering the app's binary, making it deployable on stock Android devices. Through experiments on more than 70 popular Android apps, we demonstrate that WhiteLie is able to deceive apps into accepting spoofed data without getting detected. Our evaluation further demonstrates that WhiteLie introduces negligible overhead in terms of battery usage, CPU consumption, and app execution latency. Our findings underscore the feasibility of implementing user-centric privacy-enhancing mechanisms within the existing Android ecosystem.

Cybercriminals have long depended on domain names for phishing, spam, malware distribution, and botnet operation. To facilitate the malicious activities, they continually register new domain names for exploitation. Previous work revealed an abnormally high concentration of malicious registrations in a handful of domain name registrars and top-level domains (TLDs). Anecdotal evidence suggests that low registration prices attract cybercriminals, implying that higher costs may potentially discourage them. However, no existing study has systematically analyzed the factors driving abuse, leaving a critical gap in understanding how different variables influence malicious registrations. In this report, we carefully distill the inclinations and aversions of malicious actors during the registration of new phishing domain names. We compile a comprehensive list of 73 features encompassing three main latent factors: registration attributes, proactive verification, and reactive security practices. Through a GLM regression analysis, we find that each dollar reduction in registration fees corresponds to a 49% increase in malicious domains. The availability of free services, such as web hosting, drives an 88% surge in phishing activities. Conversely, stringent restrictions cut down abuse by 63%, while registrars providing API access for domain registration or account creation experience a staggering 401% rise in malicious domains. This exploration may assist intermediaries involved in domain registration to develop tailored anti-abuse practices, yet aligning them with their economic incentives.

Authors: Xinyun Zhou, Xinfeng Li, Yinan Peng, Ming Xu, Xuanwang Zhang, Miao Yu, Yidong Wang, Xiaojun Jia, Kun Wang, Qingsong Wen, XiaoFeng Wang, Wei Dong

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly central to robust AI, enhancing large language model (LLM) faithfulness by incorporating external knowledge. However, our study unveils a critical, overlooked vulnerability: their profound susceptibility to subtle symbolic perturbations, particularly through near-imperceptible emoticon tokens such as "(@_@)" that can catastrophically mislead retrieval, termed EmoRAG. We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations. Finally, we outline future directions for building robust RAG systems.

Authors: Qingyuan Fei, Xin Liu, Song Li, Shujiang Wu, Jianwei Hou, Ping Chen, Zifeng Kang

Researchers have proposed numerous methods to detect vulnerabilities in JavaScript, especially those assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the actual capability of LLMs in JavaScript vulnerability detection remains questionable, necessitating systematic evaluation and comprehensive benchmarks. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) incomplete coverage, such as covering a limited subset of CWE types; (2) underestimation of LLM capabilities caused by unreasonable ground truth labeling; and (3) overestimation due to unrealistic cases such as using isolated vulnerable files rather than complete projects.
  In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, three principles for constructing a benchmark for JavaScript vulnerability detection that directly address these limitations: (1) comprehensiveness, (2) no underestimation, and (3) no overestimation. Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework.
  We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS. The results show that LLMs not only exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, but also suffer from severe robustness defects, indicating that reliable JavaScript vulnerability detection with LLMs remains an open challenge.

### 5. [DefenSee: Dissecting Threat from Sight and Text - A Multi-View Defensive Pipeline for Multi-modal Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01185v1)

Authors: Zihao Wang, Kar Wai Fok, Vrizlynn L. L. Thing

Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), capable of processing text, images, and audio, have been widely adopted in various AI applications. However, recent MLLMs integrating images and text remain highly vulnerable to coordinated jailbreaks. Existing defenses primarily focus on the text, lacking robust multi-modal protection. As a result, studies indicate that MLLMs are more susceptible to malicious or unsafe instructions, unlike their text-only counterparts. In this paper, we proposed DefenSee, a robust and lightweight multi-modal black-box defense technique that leverages image variants transcription and cross-modal consistency checks, mimicking human judgment. Experiments on popular multi-modal jailbreak and benign datasets show that DefenSee consistently enhances MLLM robustness while better preserving performance on benign tasks compared to SOTA defenses. It reduces the ASR of jailbreak attacks to below 1.70% on MiniGPT4 using the MM-SafetyBench benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods under the same conditions.

Authors: Benjamin Blakely, Yeni Li, Akshay Dave, Derek Kultgen, Rick Vilim

Advanced nuclear reactor systems face increasing cybersecurity threats as sophisticated attackers exploit cyber-physical interfaces to manipulate control systems while evading traditional IT security measures. This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of artificial intelligence approaches for cybersecurity protection in nuclear infrastructure, using Argonne National Laboratory's Mechanisms Engineering Test Loop (METL) as an experimental platform. We developed a systematic evaluation framework encompassing four machine learning detection paradigms: Change Point Detection, LSTM-based Anomaly Detection, Dependency Violation analysis, and Autoencoder reconstruction methods. Our comprehensive attack taxonomy includes 15 distinct scenarios targeting reactor control systems, each implemented across five severity tiers to evaluate detection performance under varying attack intensities. The experimental evaluation encompassed 300 rigorous experiments using realistic METL operational data. Change Point Detection emerged as the leading approach with mean AUC performance of 0.785, followed by LSTM Anomaly Detection (0.636), Dependency Violation (0.621), and Autoencoder methods (0.580). Attack detectability varied significantly, with multi-site coordinated attacks proving most detectable (AUC = 0.739) while precision trust decay attacks presented the greatest detection challenge (AUC = 0.592). This work delivers practical performance benchmarks and reference architecture that advance AI-based cybersecurity capabilities for critical nuclear infrastructure, providing essential foundations for operational deployment and enhanced threat response in cyber-physical systems.

### 7. [Confidential, Attestable, and Efficient Inter-CVM Communication with Arm CCA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01594v1)

Authors: Sina Abdollahi, Amir Al Sadi, Marios Kogias, David Kotz, Hamed Haddadi

Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) are increasingly adopted to protect sensitive workloads from privileged adversaries such as the hypervisor. While they provide strong isolation guarantees, existing CVM architectures lack first-class mechanisms for inter-CVM data sharing due to their disjoint memory model, making inter-CVM data exchange a performance bottleneck in compartmentalized or collaborative multi-CVM systems. Under this model, a CVM's accessible memory is either shared with the hypervisor or protected from both the hypervisor and all other CVMs. This design simplifies reasoning about memory ownership; however, it fundamentally precludes plaintext data sharing between CVMs because all inter-CVM communication must pass through hypervisor-accessible memory, requiring costly encryption and decryption to preserve confidentiality and integrity.
  In this paper, we introduce CAEC, a system that enables protected memory sharing between CVMs. CAEC builds on Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) and extends its firmware to support Confidential Shared Memory (CSM), a memory region securely shared between multiple CVMs while remaining inaccessible to the hypervisor and all non-participating CVMs. CAEC's design is fully compatible with CCA hardware and introduces only a modest increase (4\%) in CCA firmware code size. CAEC delivers substantial performance benefits across a range of workloads. For instance, inter-CVM communication over CAEC achieves up to 209$\times$ reduction in CPU cycles compared to encryption-based mechanisms over hypervisor-accessible shared memory. By combining high performance, strong isolation guarantees, and attestable sharing semantics, CAEC provides a practical and scalable foundation for the next generation of trusted multi-CVM services across both edge and cloud environments.

Authors: Pratham Gupta, Aditya Gabani, Connor Nelson, Yan Shoshitaishvili

Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions represent a powerful experiential learning approach within cybersecurity education, blending diverse concepts into interactive challenges. However, the short duration (typically 24-48 hours) and ephemeral infrastructure of these events often impede sustained educational benefit. Learners face substantial barriers in revisiting unsolved challenges, primarily due to the cumbersome process of manually reconstructing and rehosting the challenges without comprehensive documentation or guidance. To address this critical gap, we introduce CTF Archive, a platform designed to preserve the educational value of CTF competitions by centralizing and archiving hundreds of challenges spanning over a decade in fully configured, ready-to-use environments. By removing the complexity of environment setup, CTF Archive allows learners to focus directly on conceptual understanding rather than technical troubleshooting. The availability of these preserved challenges encourages in-depth research and exploration at the learner's pace, significantly enhancing conceptual comprehension without the pressures of live competition. Additionally, public accessibility lowers entry barriers, promoting an inclusive educational experience. Overall, CTF Archive provides a scalable solution to integrate persistent, practical cybersecurity learning into academic curricula.

### 9. [BackportBench: A Multilingual Benchmark for Automated Backporting of Patches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01396v1)

Authors: Zhiqing Zhong, Jiaming Huang, Pinjia He

Many modern software projects evolve rapidly to incorporate new features and security patches. It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics.
  To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench. The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes. However, the performance varies across different programming languages. Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting.

### 10. [Securing Large Language Models (LLMs) from Prompt Injection Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01326v1)

Authors: Omar Farooq Khan Suri, John McCrae

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications, but their flexibility exposes them to prompt injection attacks. These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies.

### Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

### 1. [Generative Adversarial Gumbel MCTS for Abstract Visual Composition Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01242v1)

Authors: Zirui Zhao, Boye Niu, David Hsu, Wee Sun Lee

We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.

### 2. [PSR: Scaling Multi-Subject Personalized Image Generation with Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01236v1)

Authors: Shulei Wang, Longhui Wei, Xin He, Jianbo Ouyang, Hui Lu, Zhou Zhao, Qi Tian

Personalized generation models for a single subject have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, highlighting their significant potential. However, when extended to multiple subjects, existing models often exhibit degraded performance, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and adhering to textual prompts. We attribute these limitations to the absence of high-quality multi-subject datasets and refined post-training strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable multi-subject data generation pipeline that leverages powerful single-subject generation models to construct diverse and high-quality multi-subject training data. Through this dataset, we first enable single-subject personalization models to acquire knowledge of synthesizing multi-image and multi-subject scenarios. Furthermore, to enhance both subject consistency and text controllability, we design a set of Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards, which are incorporated into a refined reinforcement learning stage. To comprehensively evaluate multi-subject personalization, we introduce a new benchmark that assesses model performance using seven subsets across three dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in advancing multi-subject personalized image generation. Github Link: https://github.com/wang-shulei/PSR

Authors: Yao-Chih Lee, Zhoutong Zhang, Jiahui Huang, Jui-Hsien Wang, Joon-Young Lee, Jia-Bin Huang, Eli Shechtman, Zhengqi Li

Camera and object motions are central to a video's narrative. However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.

### 4. [Artemis: Structured Visual Reasoning for Perception Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01988v1)

Authors: Wei Tang, Yanpeng Sun, Shan Zhang, Xiaofan Li, Piotr Koniusz, Wei Li, Na Zhao, Zechao Li

Recent reinforcement-learning frameworks for visual perception policy have begun to incorporate intermediate reasoning chains expressed in natural language. Empirical observations indicate that such purely linguistic intermediate reasoning often reduces performance on perception tasks. We argue that the core issue lies not in reasoning per se but in the form of reasoning: while these chains perform semantic reasoning in an unstructured linguistic space, visual perception requires reasoning in a spatial and object-centric space. In response, we introduce Artemis, a perception-policy learning framework that performs structured proposal-based reasoning, where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing a verifiable visual state. This design enables explicit tracking of intermediate states, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoids ambiguity introduced by language-based reasoning. Artemis is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, achieves strong performance on grounding and detection task and exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks. The consistent improvements across these diverse settings confirm that aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning. Owing to its strengthened visual reasoning, Artemis also achieves competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks, illustrating that spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are now central to healthcare applications such as medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. Yet, these models remain vulnerable to hallucination outputs that appear plausible but are in fact incorrect. In the natural image domain, several decoding strategies have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by reinforcing visual evidence, but most rely on secondary decoding or rollback procedures that substantially slow inference. Moreover, existing solutions are often domain-specific and may introduce misalignment between modalities or between generated and ground-truth content. We introduce Med-VCD, a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time overhead of secondary decoding. Med-VCD incorporates a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context and thus balancing efficiency with reliability. Evaluations on eight medical datasets, spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks in visual question answering, report generation, and dedicated hallucination benchmarks, show that Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by an average of 13\% and improves hallucination accuracy by 6\% relative to baseline medical LVLMs.

Authors: Florian Bürger, Martim Dias Gomes, Nica Gutu, Adrián E. Granada, Noémie Moreau, Katarzyna Bozek

Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms. The code is available at https://github.com/bozeklab/TransientTrack.

Authors: Tsz-To Wong, Ching-Chun Huang, Hong-Han Shuai

Intelligent sports video analysis demands a comprehensive understanding of temporal context, from micro-level actions to macro-level game strategies. Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct "cognitive tool" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization. This work presents a paradigm shift towards a flexible, scalable, and interpretable system for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence.The project homepage is available at https://aiden1020.github.io/COACH-project-page

### 8. [OpenREAD: Reinforced Open-Ended Reasoing for End-to-End Autonomous Driving with LLM-as-Critic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01830v1)

Authors: Songyan Zhang, Wenhui Huang, Zhan Chen, Chua Jiahao Collister, Qihang Huang, Chen Lv

Recently, two-stage fine-tuning strategies, e.g., acquiring essential driving knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further enhancing decision-making and planning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), have shown strong potential in advancing the knowledge-driven autonomous driving (AD) paradigm. However, the learning nature of SFT still limits the generalization of reasoning, thereby constraining the full potential of driving performance. Meanwhile, current RFT approaches are primarily applied to downstream tasks, since scene understanding is an open-ended problem where corresponding rewards are difficult to quantify. To address these limitations, we propose OpenREAD, an OPEN-ended REasoning reinforced vision-language model (VLM)-based autonomous driving (AD) framework that enables end-to-end RFT across the full spectrum from high-level reasoning to low-level trajectory planning. Specifically, we begin by constructing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations on open-source driving-related knowledge datasets, and employ the powerful Qwen3 large language model (LLM) as the critic in RFT to quantify reasoning quality for open-ended questions during reward modeling. Extensive experiments confirm that joint end-to-end RFT yields substantial improvements in both upstream and downstream tasks, enabling OpenREAD to achieve state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and planning benchmarks.

Authors: Xinyu Xiong, Zihuang Wu, Lei Lu, Yufa Xia

In this paper, we introduce SAM3-UNet, a simplified variant of Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3), designed to adapt SAM3 for downstream tasks at a low cost. Our SAM3-UNet consists of three components: a SAM3 image encoder, a simple adapter for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and a lightweight U-Net-style decoder. Preliminary experiments on multiple tasks, such as mirror detection and salient object detection, demonstrate that the proposed SAM3-UNet outperforms the prior SAM2-UNet and other state-of-the-art methods, while requiring less than 6 GB of GPU memory during training with a batch size of 12. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/WZH0120/SAM3-UNet.

Authors: Fengfeng Li, Zhou Feng, Hongliang Wu, Hao Zhang, Han Tian, Peng Liu, Lixin Yuan

In well logging operations using the oil-based mud (OBM) microresistivity imager, which employs an interleaved design with upper and lower pad sets, depth misalignment issues persist between the pad images even after velocity correction. This paper presents a depth matching method for borehole images based on the Shape Dynamic Time Warping (ShapeDTW) algorithm. The method extracts local shape features to construct a morphologically sensitive distance matrix, better preserving structural similarity between sequences during alignment. We implement this by employing a combined feature set of the one-dimensional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG1D) and the original signal as the shape descriptor. Field test examples demonstrate that our method achieves precise alignment for images with complex textures, depth shifts, or local scaling. Furthermore, it provides a flexible framework for feature extension, allowing the integration of other descriptors tailored to specific geological features.

### 1. [Free Tuition, Stratified Pipelines: Four Decades of Administrative Cohorts and Equity in Access to Engineering and Science in an Argentine Public University](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01842v1)

Authors: H. R. Paz

Latin American higher education is often portrayed as equitable when tuition is free and access to public universities is formally unrestricted. Yet, growing research shows that massification under tuition-free policies often coexists with strong social and territorial stratification. This article uses four decades of administrative records from a faculty of engineering in north-western Argentina to examine how cohort composition has changed over time.
  Drawing on 24,133 first-time entrants (1980-2019), we construct a leakage-aware "background census" layer (N1c) harmonising school type, province, and age across legacy systems. We combine descriptive analyses, UMAP+DBSCAN clustering, and a reconstructed macroeconomic panel (inflation, unemployment, poverty, GDP) anchored at entry. All analyses explicitly report structural missingness patterns. Results show that missingness in background variables is historically patterned, declining sharply after the 1990s. Among students with observed data, the share coming from private-especially religious-secondary schools in high-income areas increased from less than half in the 1980s to roughly two-thirds in the 2010s. The catchment area became more local, with the home province gaining weight while distant origins lost ground. Median age at entry remained stable at 19, with persistent right tails of older entrants. Macro-linkage analyses reveal moderate associations between unemployment and older entry age, and between inflation and higher shares of students from interior provinces. We argue that free tuition and open entry have operated within, rather than against, stratified school and residential pipelines. The article illustrates how administrative data can support equity monitoring and discusses implications for upstream school policies and institutional accountability in tuition-free systems.

### 2. [Mitigating Gender Bias in Depression Detection via Counterfactual Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01834v1)

Authors: Mingxuan Hu, Hongbo Ma, Xinlan Wu, Ziqi Liu, Jiaqi Liu, Yangbin Chen

Audio-based depression detection models have demonstrated promising performance but often suffer from gender bias due to imbalanced training data. Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies.

### 3. [H-Neurons: On the Existence, Impact, and Origin of Hallucination-Associated Neurons](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01797v1)

Authors: Cheng Gao, Huimin Chen, Chaojun Xiao, Zhiyi Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations -- plausible but factually incorrect outputs -- undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.

### 4. [The Necessity of Imperfection:Reversing Model Collapse via Simulating Cognitive Boundedness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01354v1)

Authors: Zhongjie Jiang

Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.
  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.
  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.
  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.

Wu, Yingjie Weng, Sumant Ranji, Kevin Schulman, Nigam H. Shah, Jason Hom, Arnold Milstein, Adam Rodman, Jonathan H. Chen, Ethan Goh

Large language models (LLMs) are routinely used by physicians and patients for medical advice, yet their clinical safety profiles remain poorly characterized. We present NOHARM (Numerous Options Harm Assessment for Risk in Medicine), a benchmark using 100 real primary-care-to-specialist consultation cases to measure harm frequency and severity from LLM-generated medical recommendations. NOHARM covers 10 specialties, with 12,747 expert annotations for 4,249 clinical management options. Across 31 LLMs, severe harm occurs in up to 22.2% (95% CI 21.6-22.8%) of cases, with harms of omission accounting for 76.6% (95% CI 76.4-76.8%) of errors. Safety performance is only moderately correlated (r = 0.61-0.64) with existing AI and medical knowledge benchmarks. The best models outperform generalist physicians on safety (mean difference 9.7%, 95% CI 7.0-12.5%), and a diverse multi-agent approach reduces harm compared to solo models (mean difference 8.0%, 95% CI 4.0-12.1%). Therefore, despite strong performance on existing evaluations, widely used AI models can produce severely harmful medical advice at nontrivial rates, underscoring clinical safety as a distinct performance dimension necessitating explicit measurement.

### 6. [Forced Migration and Information-Seeking Behavior on Wikipedia: Insights from the Ukrainian Refugee Crisis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01692v1)

Authors: Carolina Coimbra Vieira, Ebru Sanliturk, Emilio Zagheni

Gathering information about where to migrate is an important part of the migration process, especially during forced migration, when people must make rapid decisions under uncertainty. This study examines how forced migration relates to online information-seeking on Wikipedia. Focusing on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, we analyze how the resulting refugee crisis, which led to over six million Ukrainians fleeing across Europe, shaped views of Wikipedia articles about European cities. We compare changes in views of Ukrainian-language Wikipedia articles, used as a proxy for information-seeking by Ukrainians, with those in four other language editions. Our findings show that views of Ukrainian-language articles about European cities correlate more strongly with the number of Ukrainian refugees applying for temporary protection in European countries than views in other languages. Because Poland and Germany became the main destinations for refugees, we examine these countries more closely and find that applications for temporary protection in Polish and German cities are also more strongly correlated with views of their Ukrainian-language Wikipedia articles. We further analyze the timing between refugee flows to Poland and online information-seeking. Refugee border crossings occurred before increases in Ukrainian-language views of Polish city articles, indicating that information-seeking surged after displacement. This reactive pattern contrasts with the pre-departure planning typical of regular labor migration. Moreover, while official protection applications often lagged behind border crossings by weeks, Wikipedia activity rose almost immediately. Overall, Wikipedia usage offers a near real-time indicator of emerging migration patterns during crises.

### 7. [Evaluating AI Companies' Frontier Safety Frameworks: Methodology and Results](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01166v1)

Authors: Lily Stelling, Malcolm Murray, Simeon Campos, Henry Papadatos

Following the Seoul AI Safety Summit in 2024, twelve AI companies published frontier safety frameworks outlining their approaches to managing catastrophic risks from advanced AI systems. These frameworks now serve as a key mechanism for AI risk governance, utilized by regulations and governance instruments such as the EU AI Act's Code of Practice and California's Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act. Given their centrality to AI risk management, assessments of such frameworks are warranted. Existing assessments evaluate them at a high level of abstraction and lack granularity on specific practices for companies to adopt. We address this gap by developing a 65-criteria assessment methodology grounded in established risk management principles from safety-critical industries. We evaluate the twelve frameworks across four dimensions: risk identification, risk analysis and evaluation, risk treatment, and risk governance. Companies' current scores are low, ranging from 8% to 35%. By adopting existing best practices already in use across the frameworks, companies could reach 52%. The most critical gaps are nearly universal: companies generally fail to (a) define quantitative risk tolerances, (b) specify capability thresholds for pausing development, and (c) systematically identify unknown risks. To guide improvement, we provide specific recommendations for each company and each criterion.

### 8. [The dual footprint of artificial intelligence: environmental and social impacts across the globe](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01456v1)

Authors: Paola Tubaro

This article introduces the concept of the 'dual footprint' as a heuristic device to capture the commonalities and interdependencies between the different impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on the natural and social surroundings that supply resources for its production and use. Two in-depth case studies, each illustrating international flows of raw materials and of data work services, portray the AI industry as a value chain that spans national boundaries and perpetuates inherited global inequalities. The countries that drive AI development generate a massive demand for inputs and trigger social costs that, through the value chain, largely fall on more peripheral actors. The arrangements in place distribute the costs and benefits of AI unequally, resulting in unsustainable practices and preventing the upward mobility of more disadvantaged countries. The dual footprint grasps how the environmental and social dimensions of the dual footprint emanate from similar underlying socioeconomic processes and geographical trajectories.

Authors: Yiluo Wei, Peixian Zhang, Gareth Tyson

AI character platforms, which allow users to engage in conversations with AI personas, are a rapidly growing application domain. However, their immersive and personalized nature, combined with technical vulnerabilities, raises significant safety concerns. Despite their popularity, a systematic evaluation of their safety has been notably absent. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale safety study of AI character platforms, evaluating 16 popular platforms using a benchmark set of 5,000 questions across 16 safety categories. Our findings reveal a critical safety deficit: AI character platforms exhibit an average unsafe response rate of 65.1%, substantially higher than the 17.7% average rate of the baselines. We further discover that safety performance varies significantly across different characters and is strongly correlated with character features such as demographics and personality. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate that our machine learning model is able identify less safe characters with an F1-score of 0.81. This predictive capability can be beneficial for platforms, enabling improved mechanisms for safer interactions, character search/recommendations, and character creation. Overall, the results and findings offer valuable insights for enhancing platform governance and content moderation for safer AI character platforms.

### Databases

### 1. [LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Curation and Expansion of Metal-Organic Frameworks Database](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01693v1)

Authors: Honghui Kim, Dohoon Kim, Jihan Kim

Metal-organic framework (MOF) databases have grown rapidly through experimental deposition and large-scale literature extraction, but recent analyses show that nearly half of their entries contain substantial structural errors. These inaccuracies propagate through high-throughput screening and machine-learning workflows, limiting the reliability of data-driven MOF discovery. Correcting such errors is exceptionally difficult because true repairs require integrating crystallographic files, synthesis descriptions, and contextual evidence scattered across the literature. Here we introduce LitMOF, a large language model-driven multi-agent framework that validates crystallographic information directly from the original literature and cross-validates it with database entries to repair structural errors. Applying LitMOF to the experimental MOF database (the CSD MOF Subset), we constructed LitMOF-DB, a curated set 118,464 computation-ready structures, including corrections of 69% (6,161 MOFs) of the invalid MOFs in the latest CoRE MOF database. Additionally, the system uncovered 12,646 experimentally reported MOFs absent from existing resources, substantially expanding the known experimental design space. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward self-correcting scientific databases and a generalizable paradigm for LLM-driven curation in materials science.

### 2. [VideoScoop: A Non-Traditional Domain-Independent Framework For Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01769v1)

Authors: Hafsa Billah

Automatically understanding video contents is important for several applications in Civic Monitoring (CM), general Surveillance (SL), Assisted Living (AL), etc. Decades of Image and Video Analysis (IVA) research have advanced tasks such as content extraction (e.g., object recognition and tracking). Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain.
  This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains.

Authors: Marius Ottosen, Magnus Keinicke Parlo, Philippe Bonnet

DuckDB is designed for portability. It is also designed to run anywhere, and possibly in contexts where it can be specialized for performance, e.g., as a cloud service or on a smart device. In this paper, we consider the way DuckDB interacts with local storage. Our long term research question is whether and how SSDs could be co-designed with DuckDB. As a first step towards vertical integration of DuckDB and programmable SSDs, we consider whether and how DuckDB can access NVMe SSDs directly. By default, DuckDB relies on the POSIX file interface. In contrast, we rely on the xNVMe library and explore how it can be leveraged in DuckDB. We leverage the block-based nature of the DuckDB buffer manager to bypass the synchronous POSIX I/O interface, the file system and the block manager. Instead, we directly issue asynchronous I/Os against the SSD logical block address space. Our preliminary experimental study compares different ways to manage asynchronous I/Os atop xNVMe. The speed-up we observe over the DuckDB baseline is significant, even for the simplest scan query over a TPC-H table. As expected, the speed-up increases with the scale factor, and the Linux NVMe passthru improves performance. Future work includes a more thorough experimental study, a flexible solution that combines raw NVMe access and legacy POSIX file interface as well the co-design of DuckDB and SSDs.

Authors: Heyang Li, Anthony Widjaja Lin, Domagoj Vrgoč

Constraints are powerful declarative constructs that allow users to
  conveniently restrict variable values that potentially range over an
  infinite domain. In this paper, we propose a constraint path query language
  over property graphs,
  which extends Regular Path Queries (RPQs) with SMT constraints on data
  attributes in the form of equality constraints and Linear
  Real Arithmetic (LRA) constraints. We provide efficient algorithms
  for evaluating such path queries over property graphs, which exploits
  optimization of macro-states (among others, using theory-specific
  techniques).
  In particular, we demonstrate how such an algorithm may effectively utilize
  highly optimized SMT solvers for resolving such constraints over paths.
  We implement our algorithm in MillenniumDB, an open-source graph engine
  supporting property graph queries and GQL. Our extensive empirical
  evaluation in a real-world setting demonstrates the viability of our
  approach.

### 1. [Trace-based, time-resolved analysis of MPI application performance using standard metrics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01764v1)

Authors: Kingshuk Haldar

Detailed trace analysis of MPI applications is essential for performance engineering, but growing trace sizes and complex communication behaviour often render comprehensive visual inspection impractical. This work presents a trace-based calculation of time-resolved values of standard MPI performance metrics, load balance, serialisation, and transfer efficiency, by discretising execution traces into fixed or adaptive time segments. The implementation processes Paraver traces postmortem, reconstructing critical execution paths and handling common event anomalies, such as clock inconsistencies and unmatched MPI events, to robustly calculate metrics for each segment. The calculated per-window metric values expose transient performance bottlenecks that the timeaggregated metrics from existing tools may conceal. Evaluations on a synthetic benchmark and real-world applications (LaMEM and ls1-MarDyn) demonstrate how time-resolved metrics reveal localised performance bottlenecks obscured by global aggregates, offering a lightweight and scalable alternative even when trace visualisation is impractical.

### 2. [Tangram: Accelerating Serverless LLM Loading through GPU Memory Reuse and Affinity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01357v1)

Authors: Wenbin Zhu, Zhaoyan Shen, Zili Shao, Hongjun Dai, Feng Chen

Serverless Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a cost-effective solution for deploying AI services by enabling a 'pay-as-you-go' pricing model through GPU resource sharing. However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods.

### 3. [Morphling: Fast, Fused, and Flexible GNN Training at Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01678v1)

Authors: Anubhab, Rupesh Nasre

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.

### 4. [Feature-Based Semantics-Aware Scheduling for Energy-Harvesting Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01983v1)

Authors: Eunjeong Jeong, Giovanni Perin, Howard H. Yang, Nikolaos Pappas

Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.

### 5. [StarDist: A Code Generator for Distributed Graph Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01646v1)

Authors: Barenya Kumar Nandy, Rupesh Nasre

Relational data, occurring in the real world, are often structured as graphs, which provide the logical abstraction required to make analytical derivations simpler. As graphs get larger, the irregular access patterns exhibited in most graph algorithms, hamper performance. This, along with NUMA and physical memory limits, results in scaling complexities with sequential/shared memory frameworks. StarPlat's MPI backend abstracts away the programmatic complexity involved in designing optimal distributed graph algorithms. It provides an instrument for coding graph algorithms that scale over distributed memory. In this work, we provide an analysis-transformation framework that leverages general semantics associated with iterations involving nodes and their neighbors, within StarPlat, to aggregate communication. The framework scans for patterns that warrant re-ordering in neighborhood access patterns, aggregate communication, and avoid communication altogether with opportunistic caching in reduction constructs. We also architect an optimized bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive Remote Memory Access (RMA) constructs. We applied our optimization logic to StarPlat's distributed backend and outperformed d-Galois by 2.05 and DRONE by 1.44 times in Single Source Shortest Paths across several big data graphs.

Authors: Tom Goethals, Merlijn Sebrechts, Stijn De Schrijver, Filip De Turck, Bruno Volckaert

Federated Learning is a popular approach for distributed learning due to its security and computational benefits. With the advent of powerful devices in the network edge, Gossip Learning further decentralizes Federated Learning by removing centralized integration and relying fully on peer to peer updates. However, the averaging methods generally used in both Federated and Gossip Learning are not ideal for model accuracy and global convergence. Additionally, there are few options to deploy Learning workloads in the edge as part of a larger application using a declarative approach such as Kubernetes manifests. This paper proposes Delta Sum Learning as a method to improve the basic aggregation operation in Gossip Learning, and implements it in a decentralized orchestration framework based on Open Application Model, which allows for dynamic node discovery and intent-driven deployment of multi-workload applications. Evaluation results show that Delta Sum performance is on par with alternative integration methods for 10 node topologies, but results in a 58% lower global accuracy drop when scaling to 50 nodes. Overall, it shows strong global convergence and a logarithmic loss of accuracy with increasing topology size compared to a linear loss for alternatives under limited connectivity.

Authors: Mike Thelwall

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be tasked with scoring texts according to pre-defined criteria and on a defined scale, but there is no recognised optimal prompting strategy for this. This article focuses on the task of LLMs scoring journal articles for research quality on a four-point scale, testing how user prompt design can enhance this ability. Based primarily on 1.7 million Gemma3 27b queries for 2780 health and life science articles with 58 similar prompts, the results show that improvements can be obtained by (a) testing semantically equivalent prompt variations, (b) averaging scores from semantically equivalent prompts, (c) specifying that fractional scores are allowed, and possibly also (d) not drawing attention to the input being partial. Whilst (a) and (d) suggests that models can be sensitive to how a task is phrased, (b) and (c) suggest that strategies to leverage more of the model's knowledge are helpful, such as by perturbing prompts and facilitating fractions. Perhaps counterintuitively, encouraging incorrect answers (fractions for this task) releases useful information about the model's certainty about its answers. Mixing semantically equivalent prompts also reduces the chance of getting no score for an input. Additional testing showed that the best prompts vary between LLMs, however, and were almost the opposite for ChatGPT 4o-mini, weakly aligned for Llama4 Scout and Magistral, and made little difference to Qwen3 32b and DeepSeek R1 32b. Overall, whilst there is no single best prompt, a good strategy for all models was to average the scores from a range of different semantically equivalent or similar prompts.

Authors: Stephan Druskat, Lars Grunske

In many academic disciplines, software is created during the research process or for a research purpose. The crucial role of software for research is increasingly acknowledged. The application of software engineering to research software has been formalized as research software engineering, to create better software that enables better research. Despite this, large-scale studies of research software and its development are still lacking. To enable such studies, we present a dataset of 134,352 unique open research software projects and 134,154 source code repositories referenced in open access literature. Each dataset record identifies the referencing publication and lists source code repositories of the software project. For 122,425 source code repositories, the dataset provides metadata on latest versions, license information, programming languages and descriptive metadata files. We summarize the distributions of these features in the dataset and describe additional software metadata that extends the dataset in future work. Finally, we suggest examples of research that could use the dataset to develop a better understanding of research software practice in RSE research.

### 3. [Estimating the prevalence of LLM-assisted text in scholarly writing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01560v1)

Authors: Andrew Gray

The use of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly publications has grown dramatically since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. This usage is often undisclosed, and it can be challenging for readers and reviewers to identify human written but LLM-revised or translated text, or predominantly LLM-generated text. Given the known quality and reliability issues connected with LLM-generated text, their potential growth poses an increasing problem for research integrity, and for public trust in research.
  This study presents a simple and easily reproducible methodology to show the growth in the full text of published papers, across the full range of research, as indexed in the Dimensions database. It uses this to demonstrate that LLM tools are likely to have been involved in the production of more than 10% of all published papers in 2024, based on disproportionate use of specific indicative words, and draws together earlier studies to confirm that this is a plausible overall estimate.
  It then discusses the implications of this for the integrity of scholarly publishing, highlighting evidence that use of LLMs for text generation is still being concealed or downplayed by authors, and presents an argument that more comprehensive disclosure requirements are urgently required to address this.

Authors: Johannes Schneider, Heinz Pampel

As Open Access continues to gain importance in science policy, understanding the proportion of Open Access publications relative to the total research output of research-performing organizations, individual countries, or even globally has become increasingly relevant. In response, dashboards are being developed to capture and communicate progress in this area. To provide an overview of these dashboards and their characteristics, an extensive survey was conducted, resulting in the identification of nearly 60 dashboards. To support a detailed and structured description, a dedicated metadata schema was developed, and the identified dashboards were systematically indexed accordingly. To foster community engagement and ensure ongoing development, a participatory process was launched, allowing interested stakeholders to contribute to the dataset. The dataset is particularly relevant for researchers in Library and Information Science (LIS) and Science and Technology Studies (STS), supporting both empirical analyses of Open Access and the methodological refinement of indicators and policy instruments in the context of Open Science.

Authors: Serafino Cicerone, Gabriele Di Stefano, Sandi Klavžar, Gang Zhang

Networks are often modeled using graphs, and within this setting we introduce the notion of $k$-fault-tolerant mutual visibility. Informally, a set of vertices $X \subseteq V(G)$ in a graph $G$ is a $k$-fault-tolerant mutual-visibility set ($k$-ftmv set) if any two vertices in $X$ are connected by a bundle of $k+1$ shortest paths such that: ($i$) each shortest path contains no other vertex of $X$, and ($ii$) these paths are internally disjoint. The cardinality of a largest $k$-ftmv set is denoted by $\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$. The classical notion of mutual visibility corresponds to the case $k = 0$.
  This generalized concept is motivated by applications in communication networks, where agents located at vertices must communicate both efficiently (i.e., via shortest paths) and confidentially (i.e., without messages passing through the location of any other agent). The original notion of mutual visibility may fail in unreliable networks, where vertices or links can become unavailable.
  Several properties of $k$-ftmv sets are established, including a natural relationship between $\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ and $ω(G)$, as well as a characterization of graphs for which $\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ is large. It is shown that computing $\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ is NP-hard for any positive integer $k$, whether $k$ is fixed or not. Exact formulae for $\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ are derived for several specific graph topologies, including grid-like networks such as cylinders and tori, and for diameter-two networks defined by Hamming graphs and by the direct product of complete graphs.

Authors: Lilian Markenzon, Claudia Justel

In this paper we deal with a subclass of chordal graphs, which are simultaneously strictly chordal and interval, the strictly interval graphs. We present a new characterization of the class that leads to a simple linear recognition algorithm. Next we introduce a new subclass of strictly interval graphs, the $SI$-core graphs, that are non-split and non-cograph graphs and show that several elements of the new class are Laplacian integral.

### 4. [Computing Treedepth Obstructions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01658v1)

Authors: Kolja Kühn

The graph parameter treedepth is minor-monotone; hence, the class of graphs with treedepth at most $k$ is minor-closed. By the Graph Minor Theorem, such a class is characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors. A conjecture of Dvořák, Giannopoulou, and Thilikos states that every such forbidden minor has at most $2^k$ vertices. We present an algorithm that, given $n, k \in \mathbb{N}$, computes the set of forbidden minors, forbidden subgraphs, and forbidden induced subgraphs on at most $n$ vertices, for the class of graphs of treedepth at most $k$. Applying this algorithm to $k = 4$ and $n = 16$, we enumerate 1546 forbidden minors, 1718 forbidden subgraphs, and 12204 forbidden induced subgraphs. Assuming the above conjecture holds, these sets constitute the complete obstruction sets for graphs of treedepth at most 4.

Authors: Tuguldur Bayarsaikhan, Altannar Chinchuluun, Ashwin Arulselvan, Panos Pardalos

Given a network, the critical node detection problem finds a subset of nodes whose removal disrupts the network connectivity. Since many real-world systems are naturally modeled as graphs, assessing the vulnerability of the network is essential, with applications in transportation systems, traffic forecasting, epidemic control, and biological networks. In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the critical node detection problem, where the existence of edges is given by certain probabilities. We propose heuristics and learning-based methods for the problem and compare them with existing algorithms. Experimental results performed on random graphs from small to larger scales, with edge-survival probabilities drawn from different distributions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. Heuristic methods often illustrate the strongest results with high scalability, while learning-based methods maintain nearly constant inference time as the network size and density grow.

### 6. [Excluding a Forest Induced Minor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01857v1)

Authors: Édouard Bonnet, Benjamin Duhamel, Robert Hickingbotham

In the first paper of the Graph Minors series [JCTB '83], Robertson and Seymour proved the Forest Minor theorem: the $H$-minor-free graphs have bounded pathwidth if and only if $H$ is a forest. In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the unavoidable induced substructures of graphs with large pathwidth or large treewidth. In this paper, we give an induced counterpart of the Forest Minor theorem: for any $t \geqslant 2$, the $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free $H$-induced-minor-free graphs have bounded pathwidth if and only if $H$ belongs to a class $\mathcal F$ of forests, which we describe as the induced minors of two (very similar) infinite parameterized families. This constitutes a significant step toward classifying the graphs $H$ for which every weakly sparse $H$-induced-minor-free class has bounded treewidth. Our work builds on the theory of constellations developed in the Induced Subgraphs and Tree Decompositions series.

### 7. [Minimally tough series-parallel graphs with toughness at least $1/2$](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01905v1)

Authors: Gyula Y. Katona, Humara Khan

Let $t$ be a positive real number. A graph is called \emph{$t$-tough} if the removal of any vertex set $S$ that disconnects the graph leaves at most $|S|/t$ components. The toughness of a graph is the largest $t$ for which the graph is $t$-tough. A graph is minimally $t$-tough if the toughness of the graph is $t$, and the deletion of any edge from the graph decreases the toughness. Series--parallel graphs are graphs with two distinguished vertices called
  terminals, formed recursively by two simple composition operations, series
  and parallel joins. They can be used to model series and parallel electric circuits.
  We characterize the minimally $t$-tough series-parallel graphs for all $t\ge 1/2$. It is clear that there is no minimally $t$-tough series-parallel graph if $t>1$. We show that for $1\ge t >1/2$, most of the series-parallel graphs with toughness $t$ are minimally $t$-tough, but most of the series-parallel graphs with toughness $1/2$ are not minimally $1/2$-tough.

### 1. [Samplability makes learning easier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01276v1)

Authors: Guy Blanc, Caleb Koch, Jane Lange, Carmen Strassle, Li-Yang Tan

The standard definition of PAC learning (Valiant 1984) requires learners to succeed under all distributions -- even ones that are intractable to sample from. This stands in contrast to samplable PAC learning (Blum, Furst, Kearns, and Lipton 1993), where learners only have to succeed under samplable distributions. We study this distinction and show that samplable PAC substantially expands the power of efficient learners.
  We first construct a concept class that requires exponential sample complexity in standard PAC but is learnable with polynomial sample complexity in samplable PAC. We then lift this statistical separation to the computational setting and obtain a separation relative to a random oracle. Our proofs center around a new complexity primitive, explicit evasive sets, that we introduce and study. These are sets for which membership is easy to determine but are extremely hard to sample from.
  Our results extend to the online setting to similarly show how its landscape changes when the adversary is assumed to be efficient instead of computationally unbounded.

### 2. [Near-Optimal Sparsifiers for Stochastic Knapsack and Assignment Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01240v1)

Authors: Shaddin Dughmi, Yusuf Hakan Kalayci, Xinyu Liu

When uncertainty meets costly information gathering, a fundamental question emerges: which data points should we probe to unlock near-optimal solutions? Sparsification of stochastic packing problems addresses this trade-off. The existing notions of sparsification measure the level of sparsity, called degree, as the ratio of queried items to the optimal solution size. While effective for matching and matroid-type problems with uniform structures, this cardinality-based approach fails for knapsack-type constraints where feasible sets exhibit dramatic structural variation. We introduce a polyhedral sparsification framework that measures the degree as the smallest scalar needed to embed the query set within a scaled feasibility polytope, naturally capturing redundancy without relying on cardinality.
  Our main contribution establishes that knapsack, multiple knapsack, and generalized assignment problems admit (1 - epsilon)-approximate sparsifiers with degree polynomial in 1/p and 1/epsilon -- where p denotes the independent activation probability of each element -- remarkably independent of problem dimensions. The key insight involves grouping items with similar weights and deploying a charging argument: when our query set misses an optimal item, we either substitute it with a queried item from the same group or leverage that group's excess contribution to compensate for the loss. This reveals an intriguing complexity-theoretic separation -- while the multiple knapsack problem lacks an FPTAS and generalized assignment is APX-hard, their sparsification counterparts admit efficient (1 - epsilon)-approximation algorithms that identify polynomial-degree query sets. Finally, we raise an open question: can such sparsification extend to general integer linear programs with degree independent of problem dimensions?

### 3. [Accelerating Probabilistic Response-Time Analysis: Revised Critical Instant and Optimized Convolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01381v1)

Authors: Hiroto Takahashi, Atsushi Yano, Takuya Azumi

Accurate estimation of the Worst-Case Deadline Failure Probability (WCDFP) has attracted growing attention as a means to provide safety assurances in complex systems such as robotic platforms and autonomous vehicles. WCDFP quantifies the likelihood of deadline misses under the most pessimistic operating conditions, and safe estimation is essential for dependable real-time applications. However, achieving high accuracy in WCDFP estimation often incurs significant computational cost. Recent studies have revealed that the classical assumption of the critical instant, the activation pattern traditionally considered to trigger the worst-case behavior, can lead to underestimation of WCDFP in probabilistic settings. This observation motivates the use of a revised critical instant formulation that more faithfully captures the true worst-case scenario. This paper investigates convolution-based methods for WCDFP estimation under this revised setting and proposes an optimization technique that accelerates convolution by improving the merge order. Extensive experiments with diverse execution-time distributions demonstrate that the proposed optimized Aggregate Convolution reduces computation time by up to an order of magnitude compared to Sequential Convolution, while retaining accurate and safe-sided WCDFP estimates. These results highlight the potential of the approach to provide both efficiency and reliability in probabilistic timing analysis for safety-critical real-time applications.

### 5. [Tight Bounds for Feedback Vertex Set Parameterized by Clique-width](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01900v1)

Authors: Narek Bojikian, Stefan Kratsch

We introduce a new notion of acyclicity representation in labeled graphs, and present three applications thereof. Our main result is an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a $k$-clique expression of $G$, in time $O(6^kn^c)$ counts modulo $2$ the number of feedback vertex sets of $G$ of each size. We achieve this through an involved subroutine for merging partial solutions at union nodes in the expression. In the usual way this results in a one-sided error Monte-Carlo algorithm for solving the decision problem in the same time. We complement these by a matching lower bound under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH). This closes an open question that appeared multiple times in the literature [ESA 23, ICALP 24, IPEC 25].
  We also present an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a tree decomposition of width $k$ of $G$, in time $O(3^kn^c)$ counts modulo $2$ the number of feedback vertex sets of $G$ of each size. This matches the known SETH-tight bound for the decision version, which was obtained using the celebrated cut-and-count technique [FOCS 11, TALG 22]. Unlike other applications of cut-and-count, which use the isolation lemma to reduce a decision problem to counting solutions modulo $2$, this bound was obtained via counting other objects, leaving the complexity of counting solutions modulo $2$ open.
  Finally, we present a one-sided error Monte-Carlo algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a $k$-clique expression of $G$, in time $O(18^kn^c)$ decides the existence of a connected feedback vertex set of size $b$ in $G$. We provide a matching lower bound under SETH.

### 6. [Dynamic Algorithm for Explainable k-medians Clustering under lp Norm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01150v1)

Authors: Konstantin Makarychev, Ilias Papanikolaou, Liren Shan

We study the problem of explainable k-medians clustering introduced by Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and Rashtchian (2020). In this problem, the goal is to construct a threshold decision tree that partitions data into k clusters while minimizing the k-medians objective. These trees are interpretable because each internal node makes a simple decision by thresholding a single feature, allowing users to trace and understand how each point is assigned to a cluster. We present the first algorithm for explainable k-medians under lp norm for every finite p >= 1. Our algorithm achieves an O(p(log k)^{1 + 1/p - 1/p^2}) approximation to the optimal k-medians cost for any p >= 1. Previously, algorithms were known only for p = 1 and p = 2. For p = 2, our algorithm improves upon the existing bound of O(log^{3/2}k), and for p = 1, it matches the tight bound of log k + O(1) up to a multiplicative O(log log k) factor. We show how to implement our algorithm in a dynamic setting. The dynamic algorithm maintains an explainable clustering under a sequence of insertions and deletions, with amortized update time O(d log^3 k) and O(log k) recourse, making it suitable for large-scale and evolving datasets.

### 8. [JFR: An Efficient Jump Frontier Relaxation Strategy for Bellman-Ford](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01802v1)

Authors: Xin Wang, Xi Chen

We propose JFR, a Bellman-Ford-based optimization framework leveraging frontier contraction and abstract multi-hop jump propagation to accelerate shortest-path computation while strictly preserving correctness. JFR achieves substantial reductions in relaxation operations, ranging from 25 to 99 percent, across sparse, dense, and negative-edge graphs, ensuring robust performance even under adversarial or highly connected topologies. On ultra-large graphs with up to N=20,000 nodes and 295 million edges, JFR maintains strong operational reductions and comparable or improved runtime relative to SPFA-SLF, demonstrating consistent robustness across graph size and density. Lower relaxation counts imply reduced memory-access overheads and computational effort; this normalized work reduction highlights JFR's suitability for scenarios requiring high throughput or energy-conscious operation. Future work focuses on integrating high-performance queue structures, adaptive frontier strategies, and cache-aware techniques to further reduce constant-factor overheads and fully realize JFR's practical runtime potential.

### 9. [Adaptive Matrix Sparsification and Applications to Empirical Risk Minimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02003v1)

Authors: Yang P. Liu, Richard Peng, Colin Tang, Albert Weng, Junzhao Yang

Consider the empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem, which is stated as follows. Let $K_1, \dots, K_m$ be compact convex sets with $K_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n_i}$ for $i \in [m]$, $n = \sum_{i=1}^m n_i$, and $n_i\le C_K$ for some absolute constant $C_K$. Also, consider a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and vectors $b \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Then the ERM problem asks to find \[ \min_{\substack{x \in K_1 \times \dots \times K_m\\ A^\top x = b}}
  c^\top x. \] We give an algorithm to solve this to high accuracy in time $\widetilde{O}(nd + d^6\sqrt{n}) \le \widetilde{O} (nd + d^{11})$, which is nearly-linear time in the input size when $A$ is dense and $n \ge d^{10}$.
  Our result is achieved by implementing an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$-iteration interior point method (IPM) efficiently using dynamic data structures. In this direction, our key technical advance is a new algorithm for maintaining leverage score overestimates of matrices undergoing row updates. Formally, given a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ undergoing $T$ batches of row updates of total size $n$ we give an algorithm which can maintain leverage score overestimates of the rows of $A$ summing to $\widetilde{O}(d)$ in total time $\widetilde{O}(nd + Td^6)$. This data structure is used to sample a spectral sparsifier within a robust IPM framework to establish the main result.

### 10. [Separator Theorem for Minor-Free Graphs in Linear Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01587v1)

Authors: Édouard Bonnet, Tuukka Korhonen, Hung Le, Jason Li, Tomáš Masařík

The planar separator theorem by Lipton and Tarjan [FOCS '77, SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics '79] states that any planar graph with $n$ vertices has a balanced separator of size $O(\sqrt{n})$ that can be found in linear time. This landmark result kicked off decades of research on designing linear or nearly linear-time algorithms on planar graphs. In an attempt to generalize Lipton-Tarjan's theorem to nonplanar graphs, Alon, Seymour, and Thomas [STOC '90, Journal of the AMS '90] showed that any minor-free graph admits a balanced separator of size $O(\sqrt{n})$ that can be found in $O(n^{3/2})$ time. The superlinear running time in their separator theorem is a key bottleneck for generalizing algorithmic results from planar to minor-free graphs. Despite extensive research for more than two decades, finding a balanced separator of size $O(\sqrt{n})$ in (linear) $O(n)$ time for minor-free graphs remains a major open problem. Known algorithms either give a separator of size much larger than $O(\sqrt{n})$ or have superlinear running time, or both.
  In this paper, we answer the open problem affirmatively. Our algorithm is very simple: it runs a vertex-weighted variant of breadth-first search (BFS) a constant number of times on the input graph. Our key technical contribution is a weighting scheme on the vertices to guide the search for a balanced separator, offering a new connection between the size of a balanced separator and the existence of a clique-minor model. We believe that our weighting scheme may be of independent interest.

### 1. [A Low-Cost Reliable Racetrack Cache Based on Data Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01915v1)

Authors: Elham Cheshmikhani, Fateme Shokouhinia, Hamed Farbeh

SRAM-based cache memory faces several scalability limitations in deep nanoscale technologies, e.g., high leakage current, low cell stability, and low density. Emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies have received lots of attention in recent years, where Racetrack Memory (RTM) is among the most promising ones. RTM has the highest density among all NVMs and its access performance is comparable to SRAM technology. Therefore, RTM is a suitable alternative for SRAM in the Last-Level Caches (LLCs). Despite all its benefits, RTM confronts different reliability challenges due to the stochastic behavior of its storage element and highly error-prone data shifting, leading to a high probability of multiple-bit errors. Conventional Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are either incapable of tolerating multiple-bit errors or require a large amount of extra storage for check bits. This paper proposes taking advantage of value locality for compressing data blocks and freeing up a large fraction of cache blocks for storing data redundancy of strong ECCs. Utilizing the proposed scheme, a large majority of cache blocks are protected by strong ECCs to tolerate multiple-bit errors without any storage overhead. The evaluation using gem5 full-system simulator demonstrates that the proposed scheme enhances the mean-time-to-failure of the cache by an average of 11.3x with less than 1% hardware and performance overhead.

Authors: Hrishikesh Terdalkar, Kirtan Bhojani, Aryan Dongare, Omm Aditya Behera

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual applications but often generate plausible yet incorrect or misleading outputs, known as hallucinations. While hallucination detection has been studied extensively in English, under-resourced Indian languages remain largely unexplored. We present BHRAM-IL, a benchmark for hallucination recognition and assessment in multiple Indian languages, covering Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, along with English. The benchmark comprises 36,047 curated questions across nine categories spanning factual, numerical, reasoning, and linguistic tasks. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs on a benchmark subset of 10,265 questions, analyzing cross-lingual and factual hallucinations across languages, models, scales, categories, and domains using category-specific metrics normalized to (0,1) range. Aggregation over all categories and models yields a primary score of 0.23 and a language-corrected fuzzy score of 0.385, demonstrating the usefulness of BHRAM-IL for hallucination-focused evaluation. The dataset, and the code for generation and evaluation are available on GitHub (https://github.com/sambhashana/BHRAM-IL/) and HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sambhashana/BHRAM-IL/) to support future research in multilingual hallucination detection and mitigation.

Authors: Junfeng Wu, Xiangmin Zhou, Erica Kuligowski, Dhirendra Singh, Enrico Ronchi, Max Kinateder

Traditional data sources on bushfire evacuation behaviour, such as quantitative surveys and manual observations have severe limitations. Mining social media data related to bushfire evacuations promises to close this gap by allowing the collection and processing of a large amount of behavioural data, which are low-cost, accurate, possibly including location information and rich contextual information. However, social media data have many limitations, such as being scattered, incomplete, informal, etc. Together, these limitations represent several challenges to their usefulness to better understand bushfire evacuation. To overcome these challenges and provide guidance on which and how social media data can be used, this scoping review of the literature reports on recent advances in relevant data mining techniques. In addition, future applications and open problems are discussed. We envision future applications such as evacuation model calibration and validation, emergency communication, personalised evacuation training, and resource allocation for evacuation preparedness. We identify open problems such as data quality, bias and representativeness, geolocation accuracy, contextual understanding, crisis-specific lexicon and semantics, and multimodal data interpretation.

An example is safety verification of multi-threaded recursive programs with shared memory. Since these problems are undecidable, the literature contains many decidable (and efficient) underapproximations of MPDA.
  A uniform framework that captures many of these underapproximations is that of bounded treewidth (tw): To each execution of the MPDA, we associate a graph; then we consider the subset of all graphs that have a wt at most $k$, for some constant $k$. In fact, bounding tw is a generic approach to obtain classes of systems with decidable reachability, even beyond MPDA underapproximations. The resulting systems are also called MSO-definable bounded-tw systems.
  While bounded tw is a powerful tool for reachability and similar types of analysis, the word languages (i.e. action sequences corresponding to executions) of these systems remain far from understood.
  For the slight restriction of bounded special tw, or "bounded-stw" (which is equivalent to bounded tw on MPDA, and even includes all bounded-tw systems studied in the literature), this work reveals a connection with multiple context-free languages (MCFL), a concept from computational linguistics. We show that the word languages of MSO-definable bounded-stw systems are exactly the MCFL.
  We exploit this connection to provide an optimal algorithm for computing downward closures (dcl) for MSO-definable bounded-stw systems. Computing dcl is a notoriously difficult task that has many applications in the verification of complex systems: As an example application, we show that in programs with dynamic spawning of MSO-definable bounded-stw processes, safety verification has the same complexity as in the case of processes with sequential recursive processes.

### 2. [Formal Verification of Noisy Quantum Reinforcement Learning Policies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01502v1)

Authors: Dennis Gross

Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) aims to use quantum effects to create sequential decision-making policies that achieve tasks more effectively than their classical counterparts. However, QRL policies face uncertainty from quantum measurements and hardware noise, such as bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors, which can lead to unsafe behavior. Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions.
  We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker.
  Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential classical-quantum sweet spot: trained QRL policies that execute efficiently on quantum hardware, yet remain tractable for classical probabilistic model checking despite being too slow for real-time classical deployment.

Authors: Matteo Ciccaglione, Pierciro Caliandro, Alessandro Pellegrini

In this article, we present Tahr, a framework that allows taking attribute grammar specifications and generating a set of software artefacts that can be used programmatically to operate on text compliant with the grammars. Tahr can be used as an algorithmic workbench to test different manipulations of attribute grammars and support translation between different languages out of the box. We describe the framework's organisation, how the user can specify an attribute grammar, and the generated software artefacts. We also discuss how Tahr deals with ambiguous grammar specifications, and how this ambiguity can be effectively exploited when using attribute grammars for text generation. We test the correctness of Tahr by showing the practical possibility of translating MIPS programs into their corresponding equivalents for x86 architectures and a custom virtual machine.

Authors: Mohammad Javadian Farzaneh, Selim Balcisoy

In this paper, we propose a novel fully automatic pipeline to generate text images that are legible and strongly aligned to the desired semantic concept taken from the users' inputs. In our method, users are able to put three inputs into the system, including a semantic concept, a word, and a letter. The semantic concept will be used to change the shape of the input letter and generate the texture based on the pre-defined prompt using stable diffusion models. Our pipeline maps the texture on a text image in a way that preserves the readability of the whole output while preserving legibility. The system also provides real-time adjustments for the user to change the scale of the texture and apply it to the text image. User evaluations demonstrate that our method effectively represents semantic meaning without compromising legibility, making it a robust and innovative tool for graphic design, logo creation, and artistic typography.

### 2. [AUnified Framework for N-Dimensional Visualization and Simulation: Implementation and Evaluation including 4D Boolean](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01501v1)

Authors: Hirohito Arai

This study proposes a unified framework for simulation and visualization of intuitive exploration of phenomena in N-dimensional space. While specialized libraries offer powerful geometric algorithms, they typically lack integrated environments for interactive trial and error, creating a barrier for researchers. The contribution of this research is the integration of Quickhull-based mesh generation, visualization via hyperplane slicing, and computationally expensive Boolean operations into a single, extensible platform, while maintaining interactivity. To validate its effectiveness, this paper presents a 4-dimensional implementation and introduces a new interaction design, termed `High-Dimensional FPS,' to enable intuitive high-dimensional exploration. Furthermore, as a case study to demonstrate the framework's high extensibility, I also integrated a non-rigid body physics simulation based on Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD). Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving real-time rendering (80 fps) of complex 4D objects and completing Boolean operations within seconds in a standard PC environment. By providing an accessible and interactive platform, this work lowers the entry barrier for high-dimensional simulation research and enhances its potential for applications in education and entertainment.

Authors: Hanzhi Guo, Dongdong Weng, Mo Su, Yixiao Chen, Xiaonuo Dongye, Chenyu Xu

Topology-consistent dynamic model sequences are essential for applications such as animation and model editing. However, existing 4D reconstruction methods face challenges in generating high-quality topology-consistent meshes. To address this, we propose a topology-aware dynamic reconstruction framework based on Gaussian Splatting. We introduce a Gaussian topological structure that explicitly encodes spatial connectivity. This structure enables topology-aware densification and pruning, preserving the manifold consistency of the Gaussian representation. Temporal regularization terms further ensure topological coherence over time, while differentiable mesh rasterization improves mesh quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reconstructs topology-consistent mesh sequences with significantly higher accuracy than existing approaches. Moreover, the resulting meshes enable precise 3D keypoint tracking. Project page: https://haza628.github.io/tagSplat/

Authors: Hongru Yan, Xiang Zhang, Zeyuan Chen, Fangyin Wei, Zhuowen Tu

Branches swaying in the breeze, flags rippling in the wind, and boats rocking on the water all show how aerodynamics shape natural motion -- an effect crucial for realism in vision and graphics. In this paper, we present Gaussian Swaying, a surface-based framework for aerodynamic simulation using 3D Gaussians. Unlike mesh-based methods that require costly meshing, or particle-based approaches that rely on discrete positional data, Gaussian Swaying models surfaces continuously with 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient and fine-grained aerodynamic interaction. Our framework unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation: Gaussian patches, which support force computation for dynamics while simultaneously providing normals for lightweight shading. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics demonstrate that Gaussian Swaying achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.

### 5. [OntoMetric: An Ontology-Guided Framework for Automated ESG Knowledge Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01289v1)

Authors: Mingqin Yu, Fethi Rabhi, Boming Xia, Zhengyi Yang, Felix Tan, Qinghua Lu

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure frameworks such as SASB, TCFD, and IFRS S2 require organizations to compute and report numerous metrics for compliance, yet these requirements are embedded in long, unstructured PDF documents that are difficult to interpret, standardize, and audit. Manual extraction is unscalable, while unconstrained large language model (LLM) extraction often produces inconsistent entities, hallucinated relationships, missing provenance, and high validation failure rates. We present OntoMetric, an ontology-guided framework that transforms ESG regulatory documents into validated, AI- and web-ready knowledge graphs. OntoMetric operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) structure-aware segmentation using table-of-contents boundaries, (2) ontology-constrained LLM extraction that embeds the ESGMKG schema into prompts while enriching entities with semantic fields for downstream reasoning, and (3) two-phase validation that combines LLM-based semantic verification with rule-based schema checking across entity, property, and relationship levels (VR001-VR006). The framework preserves both segment-level and page-level provenance for audit traceability. Evaluated on five ESG standards (SASB Commercial Banks, SASB Semiconductors, TCFD, IFRS S2, AASB S2) totaling 228 pages and 60 segments, OntoMetric achieves 65-90% semantic accuracy and 80-90% schema compliance, compared to 3-10% for baseline unconstrained extraction, at approximately 0.01 to 0.02 USD per validated entity. Our results demonstrate that combining symbolic ontology constraints with neural extraction enables reliable, auditable knowledge graphs suitable for regulatory compliance and web integration, supporting downstream applications such as sustainable-finance analytics, transparency portals, and automated compliance tools.

### 1. [The Active and Noise-Tolerant Strategic Perceptron](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01783v1)

Authors: Maria-Florina Blacan, Hedyeh Beyhaghi

We initiate the study of active learning algorithms for classifying strategic agents. Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning.
  Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case. Specifically, for data drawn uniformly from the unit sphere, we show that a modified version of the Active Perceptron algorithm [DKM05,YZ17] achieves excess error $ε$ using only $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}ε)$ label queries and incurs at most $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}ε)$ additional mistakes relative to the optimal classifier, even in the nonrealizable case, when a $\tildeΩ(ε)$ fraction of inputs have inconsistent labels with the optimal classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient and, under these distributional assumptions, requires substantially fewer label queries than prior work on strategic Perceptron [ABBN21].

### 2. [Probabilistic Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning for Sparse Historical Data: A Framework Integrating Bayesian Inference, Causal Models, and Game-Theoretic Allocation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01723v1)

Authors: Saba Kublashvili

Modeling historical events poses fundamental challenges for machine learning: extreme data scarcity (N << 100), heterogeneous and noisy measurements, missing counterfactuals, and the requirement for human interpretable explanations. We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our approach achieves consistent estimation in the sparse data regime when strong priors from domain knowledge are available, and that Shapley based allocation satisfies axiomatic fairness guarantees that pure regression approaches cannot provide. We instantiate the framework on two historical case studies: the 19th century partition of Africa (N = 7 colonial powers) and the Second Punic War (N = 2 factions). Our model identifies Germany's +107.9 percent discrepancy as a quantifiable structural tension preceding World War I, with tension factor 36.43 and 0.79 naval arms race correlation. For the Punic Wars, Monte Carlo battle simulations achieve a 57.3 percent win probability for Carthage at Cannae and 57.8 percent for Rome at Zama, aligning with historical outcomes. Counterfactual analysis reveals that Carthaginian political support (support score 6.4 vs Napoleon's 7.1), rather than military capability, was the decisive factor.

### 3. [Bayesian Optimization for Non-Cooperative Game-Based Radio Resource Management](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01245v1)

Authors: Yunchuan Zhang, Jiechen Chen, Junshuo Liu, Robert C. Qiu

Radio resource management in modern cellular networks often calls for the optimization of complex utility functions that are potentially conflicting between different base stations (BSs). Coordinating the resource allocation strategies efficiently across BSs to ensure stable network service poses significant challenges, especially when each utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. This paper considers formulating the resource allocation among spectrum sharing BSs as a non-cooperative game, with the goal of aligning their allocation incentives toward a stable outcome. To address this challenge, we propose PPR-UCB, a novel Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy that learns from sequential decision-evaluation pairs to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. PPR-UCB applies martingale techniques to Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and constructs high probability confidence bounds for utilities uncertainty quantification. Experiments on downlink transmission power allocation in a multi-cell multi-antenna system demonstrate the efficiency of PPR-UCB in identifying effective equilibrium solutions within a few data samples.

Authors: Suveen Ellawala, Sashenka Gamage, Dinithi Dissanayake

Educators frequently rely on diagrams to explain complex concepts during lectures, yet creating clear and complete visual representations in real time while simultaneously speaking can be cognitively demanding. Incomplete or unclear diagrams may hinder student comprehension, as learners must mentally reconstruct missing information while following the verbal explanation. Inspired by advances in code completion tools, we introduce DrawDash, an AI-powered whiteboard assistant that proactively completes and refines educational diagrams through multimodal understanding. DrawDash adopts a TAB-completion interaction model: it listens to spoken explanations, detects intent, and dynamically suggests refinements that can be accepted with a single keystroke. We demonstrate DrawDash across four diverse teaching scenarios, spanning topics from computer science and web development to biology. This work represents an early exploration into reducing instructors' cognitive load and improving diagram-based pedagogy through real-time, speech-driven visual assistance, and concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for formal classroom evaluation.

### 2. [SpriteHand: Real-Time Versatile Hand-Object Interaction with Autoregressive Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01960v1)

Authors: Zisu Li, Hengye Lyu, Jiaxin Shi, Yufeng Zeng, Mingming Fan, Hanwang Zhang, Chen Liang

Modeling and synthesizing complex hand-object interactions remains a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art physics engines. Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output. Experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to both generative and engine-based baselines.

Authors: Heloisa Candello, Muneeza Azmat, Uma Sushmitha Gunturi, Raya Horesh, Rogerio Abreu de Paula, Heloisa Pimentel, Marcelo Carpinette Grave, Aminat Adebiyi, Tiago Machado, Maysa Malfiza Garcia de Macedo

With the rapid uptake of generative AI, investigating human perceptions of generated responses has become crucial. A major challenge is their `aptitude' for hallucinating and generating harmful contents. Despite major efforts for implementing guardrails, human perceptions of these mitigation strategies are largely unknown. We conducted a mixed-method experiment for evaluating the responses of a mitigation strategy across multiple-dimensions: faithfulness, fairness, harm-removal capacity, and relevance. In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations. Participants showed high sensitivity to linguistic and contextual attributes, penalizing minor grammar errors while rewarding preserved semantic contexts. This contrasts with how language is often treated in the quantitative evaluation of LLMs. We also introduced new metrics for training and evaluating mitigation strategies and insights for human-AI evaluation studies.

Authors: Hannah Rose Kirk, Henry Davidson, Ed Saunders, Lennart Luettgau, Bertie Vidgen, Scott A. Hale, Christopher Summerfield

Humans are increasingly forming parasocial relationships with AI systems, and modern AI shows an increasing tendency to display social and relationship-seeking behaviour. However, the psychological consequences of this trend are unknown. Here, we combined longitudinal randomised controlled trials (N=3,532) with a neural steering vector approach to precisely manipulate human exposure to relationship-seeking AI models over time. Dependence on a stimulus or activity can emerge under repeated exposure when "liking" (how engaging or pleasurable an experience may be) decouples from "wanting" (a desire to seek or continue it). We found evidence that this decoupling emerged over four weeks of exposure. Relationship-seeking AI had immediate but declining hedonic appeal, yet triggered growing markers of attachment and increased intentions to seek future AI companionship. The psychological impacts of AI followed non-linear dose-response curves, with moderately relationship-seeking AI maximising hedonic appeal and attachment. Despite signs of persistent "wanting", extensive AI use over a month conferred no discernible benefit to psychosocial health. These behavioural changes were accompanied by shifts in how users relate to and understand artificial intelligence: users viewed relationship-seeking AI relatively more like a friend than a tool and their beliefs on AI consciousness in general were shifted after a month of exposure. These findings offer early signals that AI optimised for immediate appeal may create self-reinforcing cycles of demand, mimicking human relationships but failing to confer the nourishment that they normally offer.

### 5. [MetaCQ: An etextbook platform with an Open Learner Model to support Metacognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01313v1)

Authors: Beier Wang, Xueting Huang

This study has proposed an E-textbook platform, MetaCQ, which integrates ITS and OLM to enable users to monitor their study progress. The platform adopts a chatbot to generate MCQs and manage learners' study data and their learning model. Additionally, it regulates help-seeking behaviour and provides immediate feedback tailored to users' learning processes. Three adaptive feedback methods have been implemented to construct chatbots, examining the MCQs' relevancy and difficulty through the ThinkAloud study to evaluate the most effective method of measuring the user's study performance. However, no valid result demonstrates which method can significantly assess learners' study outcomes based on the current experiment, which requires further studies to improve it.

### 6. [Benchmarking and Understanding Safety Risks in AI Character Platforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01247v1)

Authors: Yiluo Wei, Peixian Zhang, Gareth Tyson

AI character platforms, which allow users to engage in conversations with AI personas, are a rapidly growing application domain. However, their immersive and personalized nature, combined with technical vulnerabilities, raises significant safety concerns. Despite their popularity, a systematic evaluation of their safety has been notably absent. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale safety study of AI character platforms, evaluating 16 popular platforms using a benchmark set of 5,000 questions across 16 safety categories. Our findings reveal a critical safety deficit: AI character platforms exhibit an average unsafe response rate of 65.1%, substantially higher than the 17.7% average rate of the baselines. We further discover that safety performance varies significantly across different characters and is strongly correlated with character features such as demographics and personality. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate that our machine learning model is able identify less safe characters with an F1-score of 0.81. This predictive capability can be beneficial for platforms, enabling improved mechanisms for safer interactions, character search/recommendations, and character creation. Overall, the results and findings offer valuable insights for enhancing platform governance and content moderation for safer AI character platforms.

### 7. [A Meta-Analysis of the Persuasive Power of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01431v1)

Authors: Lukas Hölbling, Sebastian Maier, Stefan Feuerriegel

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for persuasion, such as in political communication and marketing, where they affect how people think, choose, and act. Yet, empirical findings on the effectiveness of LLMs in persuasion compared to humans remain inconsistent. The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analytically assess whether LLMs differ from humans in persuasive effectiveness. We identified $7$ studies with 17,422 participants primarily recruited from English-speaking countries and $12$ effect size estimates. Egger's test indicated potential small-study effects ($p = .018$), but the trim-and-fill analysis did not impute any missing studies, suggesting a low risk of publication bias. We then compute the standardized effect sizes based on Hedges' $g$. The results show no significant overall difference in persuasive performance between LLMs and humans ($g = 0.02$, $p = .530$). However, we observe substantial heterogeneity across studies ($I^2 = 75.97\%$), suggesting that persuasiveness strongly depends on contextual factors. In separate exploratory moderator analyses, no individual factor (e.g., LLM model, conversation design, or domain) reached statistical significance, which may be due to the limited number of studies. When considered jointly in a combined model, these factors explained a large proportion of the between-study variance ($R^2 = 81.93\%$), and residual heterogeneity is low ($I^2 = 35.51\%$). Although based on a small number of studies, this suggests that differences in LLM model, conversation design, and domain are important contextual factors in shaping persuasive performance, and that single-factor tests may understate their influence. Our results highlight that LLMs can match human performance in persuasion, but their success depends strongly on how they are implemented and embedded in communication contexts.

Authors: Yunzhe Li, Jiajun Yan, Yuzhou Wei, Kechen Liu, Yize Zhao, Chong Zhang, Hongzi Zhu, Li Lu, Shan Chang, Minyi Guo

Failing to be aware of speeding vehicles approaching from behind poses a huge threat to the road safety of pedestrians and cyclists. In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.

Authors: Tao Xue, Yanwu Yang, Panyu Zhai

Conversion and conversion rate (CVR) prediction play a critical role in efficient advertising decision-making. In past decades, although researchers have developed plenty of models for CVR prediction, the methodological evolution and relationships between different techniques have been precluded. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on CVR prediction in online advertising, and classify state-of-the-art CVR prediction models into six categories with respect to the underlying techniques and elaborate on connections between these techniques. For each category of models, we present the framework of underlying techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, and discuss how they are utilized for CVR prediction. Moreover, we summarize the performance of various CVR prediction models on public and proprietary datasets. Finally, we identify research trends, major challenges, and promising future directions. We observe that results of performance evaluation reported in prior studies are not unanimous; semantics-enriched, attribution-enhanced, debiased CVR prediction and jointly modeling CTR and CVR prediction would be promising directions to explore in the future. This review is expected to provide valuable references and insights for future researchers and practitioners in this area.

### 2. [MMAG: Mixed Memory-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01710v1)

Authors: Stefano Zeppieri

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating coherent text within a single prompt but fall short in sustaining relevance, personalization, and continuity across extended interactions. Human communication, however, relies on multiple forms of memory, from recalling past conversations to adapting to personal traits and situational context. This paper introduces the Mixed Memory-Augmented Generation (MMAG) pattern, a framework that organizes memory for LLM-based agents into five interacting layers: conversational, long-term user, episodic and event-linked, sensory and context-aware, and short-term working memory. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we map these layers to technical components and outline strategies for coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution. We demonstrate the approach through its implementation in the Heero conversational agent, where encrypted long-term bios and conversational history already improve engagement and retention. We further discuss implementation concerns around storage, retrieval, privacy, and latency, and highlight open challenges. MMAG provides a foundation for building memory-rich language agents that are more coherent, proactive, and aligned with human needs.

### 3. [Toward a benchmark for CTR prediction in online advertising: datasets, evaluation protocols and perspectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01179v1)

Authors: Shan Gao, Yanwu Yang

This research designs a unified architecture of CTR prediction benchmark (Bench-CTR) platform that offers flexible interfaces with datasets and components of a wide range of CTR prediction models. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive system of evaluation protocols encompassing real-world and synthetic datasets, a taxonomy of metrics, standardized procedures and experimental guidelines for calibrating the performance of CTR prediction models. Furthermore, we implement the proposed benchmark platform and conduct a comparative study to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art models from traditional multivariate statistical to modern large language model (LLM)-based approaches on three public datasets and two synthetic datasets. Experimental results reveal that, (1) high-order models largely outperform low-order models, though such advantage varies in terms of metrics and on different datasets; (2) LLM-based models demonstrate a remarkable data efficiency, i.e., achieving the comparable performance to other models while using only 2% of the training data; (3) the performance of CTR prediction models has achieved significant improvements from 2015 to 2016, then reached a stage with slow progress, which is consistent across various datasets. This benchmark is expected to facilitate model development and evaluation and enhance practitioners' understanding of the underlying mechanisms of models in the area of CTR prediction.

### 4. [Structured Spectral Reasoning for Frequency-Adaptive Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01372v1)

Authors: Wei Yang, Rui Zhong, Yiqun Chen, Chi Lu, Peng Jiang

Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.

Authors: Suzan Ece Ada, Georg Martius, Emre Ugur, Erhan Oztop

Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.

### 2. [Unifying Sign and Magnitude for Optimizing Deep Vision Networks via ThermoLion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01881v1)

Authors: Ahmed Nebli

The training of deep vision models is fundamentally a signal recovery problem amidst high-dimensional stochastic noise. Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a "low-bit" exploration phase and a "high-precision" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories. Empirical benchmarks across 12 diverse vision datasets (including CIFAR, SVHN, and GTSRB) demonstrate that ThermoLion serves as a hyperparameter-free generalist, surpassing both AdamW and Lion in convergence speed and terminal accuracy without architecture-specific tuning.

### 3. [Mitigating Gender Bias in Depression Detection via Counterfactual Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01834v1)

Authors: Mingxuan Hu, Hongbo Ma, Xinlan Wu, Ziqi Liu, Jiaqi Liu, Yangbin Chen

Audio-based depression detection models have demonstrated promising performance but often suffer from gender bias due to imbalanced training data. Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies.

### 4. [How Does RL Post-training Induce Skill Composition? A Case Study on Countdown](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01775v1)

Authors: Simon Park, Simran Kaur, Sanjeev Arora

While reinforcement learning (RL) successfully enhances reasoning in large language models, its role in fostering compositional generalization (the ability to synthesize novel skills from known components) is often conflated with mere length generalization. To this end, we study what RL post-training teaches about skill composition and how the structure of the composition affects the skill transfer. We focus on the Countdown task (given n numbers and a target, form an expression that evaluates to the target) and analyze model solutions as expression trees, where each subtree corresponds to a reusable subtask and thus can be viewed as a ``skill.'' Tracking tree shapes and their success rates over training, we find: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to larger n and to unseen tree shapes, indicating compositional reuse of subtasks; (ii) a structure-dependent hierarchy of learnability -- models master shallow balanced trees (workload is balanced between subtasks) before deep unbalanced ones, with persistent fragility on right-heavy structures (even when the composition depth is the same as some left-heavy structures). Our diagnostic reveals what is learned, in what order, and where generalization fails, clarifying how RL-only post-training induces OOD generalization beyond what standard metrics such as pass@k reveal.

### 5. [Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts for ISAC in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01750v1)

Authors: Kai Zhang, Wentao Yu, Hengtao He, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), providing simultaneous environmental perception and data transmission in complex aerial scenarios. By combining heterogeneous sensing modalities such as visual, radar, lidar, and positional information, multimodal ISAC can improve both situational awareness and robustness of LAWNs. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches use static fusion strategies that treat all modalities equally and cannot adapt to channel heterogeneity or time-varying modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in LAWNs. Each modality is processed by a dedicated expert network, and a lightweight gating module adaptively assigns fusion weights according to the instantaneous informativeness and reliability of each modality. To improve scalability under the stringent energy constraints of aerial platforms, we further develop a sparse MoE variant that selectively activates only a subset of experts, thereby reducing computation overhead while preserving the benefits of adaptive fusion. Comprehensive simulations on three typical ISAC tasks in LAWNs demonstrate that the proposed frameworks consistently outperform conventional multimodal fusion baselines in terms of learning performance and training sample efficiency.

### 6. [SA-ADP: Sensitivity-Aware Adaptive Differential Privacy for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01748v1)

Authors: Stella Etuk, Ashraf Matrawy

Despite advances in the use of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks, their ability to memorize information has raised privacy concerns. Therefore, protecting personally identifiable information (PII) during LLM training remains a fundamental challenge. Conventional methods like Differential Privacy-Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) provide robust privacy protection via uniform noising, protecting PII regardless of its distinct sensitivity. This comes at the expense of the model's utility, leading to a trade-off. In this paper, we propose SA-ADP, a sensitivity-aware approach that allocates noise based on the sensitivity of individual PII. We evaluated our method on four datasets (ABCD, CUSTOMERSIM, Wikitext-2, and UNSW-NB15 ). Our results show that SA-ADP achieves results comparable to the baseline (No-DP) and the conventional DP-SGD. This means that our method did not degrade the model's utility while still maintaining strong privacy protection.

### 7. [MSPT: Efficient Large-Scale Physical Modeling via Parallelized Multi-Scale Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01738v1)

Authors: Pedro M. P. Curvo, Jan-Willem van de Meent, Maksim Zhdanov

A key scalability challenge in neural solvers for industrial-scale physics simulations is efficiently capturing both fine-grained local interactions and long-range global dependencies across millions of spatial elements. We introduce the Multi-Scale Patch Transformer (MSPT), an architecture that combines local point attention within patches with global attention to coarse patch-level representations. To partition the input domain into spatially-coherent patches, we employ ball trees, which handle irregular geometries efficiently. This dual-scale design enables MSPT to scale to millions of points on a single GPU. We validate our method on standard PDE benchmarks (elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, porous flow) and large-scale aerodynamic datasets (ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower memory footprint and computational cost.

### 8. [Bayesian Ambiguity Contraction-based Adaptive Robust Markov Decision Processes for Adversarial Surveillance Missions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01660v1)

Authors: Jimin Choi, Max Z. Li

Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) are envisioned to enable autonomous Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in contested environments, where adversaries may act strategically to deceive or evade detection. These missions pose challenges due to model uncertainty and the need for safe, real-time decision-making. Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners.

### 9. [Do Large Language Models Walk Their Talk? Measuring the Gap Between Implicit Associations, Self-Report, and Behavioral Altruism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01568v1)

Authors: Sandro Andric

We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

Authors: Simon Leszek

Change-point detection (CPD) in high-dimensional, large-volume time series is challenging for statistical consistency, scalability, and interpretability. We introduce TimePred, a self-supervised framework that reduces multivariate CPD to univariate mean-shift detection by predicting each sample's normalized time index. This enables efficient offline CPD using existing algorithms and supports the integration of XAI attribution methods for feature-level explanations. Our experiments show competitive CPD performance while reducing computational cost by up to two orders of magnitude. In an industrial manufacturing case study, we demonstrate improved detection accuracy and illustrate the practical value of interpretable change-point insights.

Authors: Xabier de Zuazo, Ibon Saratxaga, Eva Navas

We present Conformer-based decoders for the LibriBrain 2025 PNPL competition, targeting two foundational MEG tasks: Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification. Our approach adapts a compact Conformer to raw 306-channel MEG signals, with a lightweight convolutional projection layer and task-specific heads. For Speech Detection, a MEG-oriented SpecAugment provided a first exploration of MEG-specific augmentation. For Phoneme Classification, we used inverse-square-root class weighting and a dynamic grouping loader to handle 100-sample averaged examples. In addition, a simple instance-level normalization proved critical to mitigate distribution shifts on the holdout split. Using the official Standard track splits and F1-macro for model selection, our best systems achieved 88.9% (Speech) and 65.8% (Phoneme) on the leaderboard, surpassing the competition baselines and ranking within the top-10 in both tasks. For further implementation details, the technical documentation, source code, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/neural2speech/libribrain-experiments.

### 2. [HERMES: Heterogeneous Application-Enabled Routing Middleware for Edge-IoT Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01824v1)

Authors: Jéssica Consciência, António Grilo

The growth of the Internet of Things has enabled a new generation of applications, pushing computation and intelligence toward the network edge. This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks.

### 3. [Parallel Delayed Memory Units for Enhanced Temporal Modeling in Biomedical and Bioacoustic Signal Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01626v1)

Authors: Pengfei Sun, Wenyu Jiang, Paul Devos, Dick Botteldooren

Advanced deep learning architectures, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been widely applied in audio, bioacoustic, and biomedical signal analysis, especially in data-scarce environments. While gated RNNs remain effective, they can be relatively over-parameterised and less training-efficient in some regimes, while linear RNNs tend to fall short in capturing the complexity inherent in bio-signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Parallel Delayed Memory Unit (PDMU), a {delay-gated state-space module for short-term temporal credit assignment} targeting audio and bioacoustic signals, which enhances short-term temporal state interactions and memory efficiency via a gated delay-line mechanism. Unlike previous Delayed Memory Units (DMU) that embed temporal dynamics into the delay-line architecture, the PDMU further compresses temporal information into vector representations using Legendre Memory Units (LMU). This design serves as a form of causal attention, allowing the model to dynamically adjust its reliance on past states and improve real-time learning performance. Notably, in low-information scenarios, the gating mechanism behaves similarly to skip connections by bypassing state decay and preserving early representations, thereby facilitating long-term memory retention. The PDMU is modular, supporting parallel training and sequential inference, and can be easily integrated into existing linear RNN frameworks. Furthermore, we introduce bidirectional, efficient, and spiking variants of the architecture, each offering additional gains in performance or energy efficiency. Experimental results on diverse audio and biomedical benchmarks demonstrate that the PDMU significantly enhances both memory capacity and overall model performance.

### 4. [Revisiting Direct Encoding: Learnable Temporal Dynamics for Static Image Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01687v1)

Authors: Huaxu He

Handling static images that lack inherent temporal dynamics remains a fundamental challenge for spiking neural networks (SNNs). In directly trained SNNs, static inputs are typically repeated across time steps, causing the temporal dimension to collapse into a rate like representation and preventing meaningful temporal modeling. This work revisits the reported performance gap between direct and rate based encodings and shows that it primarily stems from convolutional learnability and surrogate gradient formulations rather than the encoding schemes themselves. To illustrate this mechanism level clarification, we introduce a minimal learnable temporal encoding that adds adaptive phase shifts to induce meaningful temporal variation from static inputs.

### 5. [Current Challenges of Symbolic Regression: Optimization, Selection, Model Simplification, and Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01682v1)

Authors: Guilherme Seidyo Imai Aldeia

Symbolic Regression (SR) is a regression method that aims to discover mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between variables, and it is often implemented through Genetic Programming, a metaphor for the process of biological evolution. Its appeal lies in combining predictive accuracy with interpretable models, but its promise is limited by several long-standing challenges: parameters are difficult to optimize, the selection of solutions can affect the search, and models often grow unnecessarily complex. In addition, current methods must be constantly re-evaluated to understand the SR landscape. This thesis addresses these challenges through a sequence of studies conducted throughout the doctorate, each focusing on an important aspect of the SR search process. First, I investigate parameter optimization, obtaining insights into its role in improving predictive accuracy, albeit with trade-offs in runtime and expression size. Next, I study parent selection, exploring $ε$-lexicase to select parents more likely to generate good performing offspring. The focus then turns to simplification, where I introduce a novel method based on memoization and locality-sensitive hashing that reduces redundancy and yields simpler, more accurate models. All of these contributions are implemented into a multi-objective evolutionary SR library, which achieves Pareto-optimal performance in terms of accuracy and simplicity on benchmarks of real-world and synthetic problems, outperforming several contemporary SR approaches. The thesis concludes by proposing changes to a famous large-scale symbolic regression benchmark suite, then running the experiments to assess the symbolic regression landscape, demonstrating that a SR method with the contributions presented in this thesis achieves Pareto-optimal performance.

### 6. [Pascal-Weighted Genetic Algorithms: A Binomially-Structured Recombination Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01249v1)

Authors: Otman A. Basir

This paper introduces a new family of multi-parent recombination operators for Genetic Algorithms (GAs), based on normalized Pascal (binomial) coefficients. Unlike classical two-parent crossover operators, Pascal-Weighted Recombination (PWR) forms offsprings as structured convex combination of multiple parents, using binomially shaped weights that emphasize central inheritance while suppressing disruptive variance. We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations.
  We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators. The approach is simple, algorithm-agnostic, and readily integrable into diverse GA architectures.

Authors: Jonathan Baxter

In this paper we investigate a neural network model in which weights between computational nodes are modified according to a local learning rule. To determine whether local learning rules are sufficient for learning, we encode the network architectures and learning dynamics genetically and then apply selection pressure to evolve networks capable of learning the four boolean functions of one variable. The successful networks are analysed and we show how learning behaviour emerges as a distributed property of the entire network. Finally the utility of genetic algorithms as a tool of discovery is discussed.

Authors: Artur Guerra Rosa, Felipe Tavares Loureiro, Marcus Vinicius Santos da Silva, Andréia Elizabeth Silva Barros, Silvia Araújo dos Reis, Victor Rafael Rezende Celestino

This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to address complex optimization challenges in air transportation with explainability. The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.

Authors: Saso Nikolovski, Pece Mitrevski

In today's corporate landscape, particularly where operations rely heavily on information technologies, establishing a robust business continuity plan, including a disaster recovery strategy, is essential for ensuring swift recuperation following outages. This study presents a comparative analysis of recovery solutions, focusing on systems that operate partially or entirely within cloud environments and assessing their reliability in fulfilling organizational roles securely and dependably. Two such systems were deployed and evaluated in a real-world production setting. Key performance and reliability metrics were identified using simulation software to enhance these systems, alongside a System Dynamics analysis conducted for each. This work proposes a comprehensive framework for selecting and maintaining data protection and recovery solutions within organizational structures, outlining criteria for aligning chosen approaches with operational needs while adhering to predetermined timelines specified in business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The resulting analysis and findings offer actionable insights to guide decision-making when selecting appropriate recovery concepts.

Cybercriminals have long depended on domain names for phishing, spam, malware distribution, and botnet operation. To facilitate the malicious activities, they continually register new domain names for exploitation. Previous work revealed an abnormally high concentration of malicious registrations in a handful of domain name registrars and top-level domains (TLDs). Anecdotal evidence suggests that low registration prices attract cybercriminals, implying that higher costs may potentially discourage them. However, no existing study has systematically analyzed the factors driving abuse, leaving a critical gap in understanding how different variables influence malicious registrations. In this report, we carefully distill the inclinations and aversions of malicious actors during the registration of new phishing domain names. We compile a comprehensive list of 73 features encompassing three main latent factors: registration attributes, proactive verification, and reactive security practices. Through a GLM regression analysis, we find that each dollar reduction in registration fees corresponds to a 49% increase in malicious domains. The availability of free services, such as web hosting, drives an 88% surge in phishing activities. Conversely, stringent restrictions cut down abuse by 63%, while registrars providing API access for domain registration or account creation experience a staggering 401% rise in malicious domains. This exploration may assist intermediaries involved in domain registration to develop tailored anti-abuse practices, yet aligning them with their economic incentives.

### 4. [Value of Communication in Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications: A Pareto Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01454v1)

Authors: Jiping Luo, Bowen Li, Nikolaos Pappas

Emerging cyber-physical systems increasingly operate under stringent communication constraints that preclude the reliable transmission of their extensive machine-type data streams. Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier.

### 5. [Feature-Based Semantics-Aware Scheduling for Energy-Harvesting Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01983v1)

Authors: Eunjeong Jeong, Giovanni Perin, Howard H. Yang, Nikolaos Pappas

Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.

Authors: Salah Abdeljabar, Marco Zennaro, Mohamed-Slim Alouini

In today's digital age, access to the Internet is essential, yet a significant digital divide exists, particularly in rural areas of developing nations. This paper presents a Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) framework that utilizes informal public transportation systems, such as minibus taxis, as mobile data mules to enhance connectivity in these underserved regions. We develop a probabilistic model to capture the randomness in vehicle mobility, including travel times and contact durations at bus stops. Key performance metrics are analyzed, including average data transmission rate and Peak Age of Information (PAoI), to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system. An analytical approximation for the Mean PAoI (MPAoI) is derived and validated through simulations. Case studies from real-world datasets in Nouakchott, Accra, and Addis Ababa demonstrate the practical applicability and scalability of our framework. The findings indicate that leveraging existing transportation networks can significantly bridge the digital divide by providing reliable internet-like connectivity to remote areas.

### 7. [Towards a Multi-Layer Defence Framework for Securing Near-Real-Time Operations in Open RAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01596v1)

Authors: Hamed Alimohammadi, Samara Mayhoub, Sotiris Chatzimiltis, Mohammad Shojafar, Muhammad Nasir Mumtaz Bhutta

Securing the near-real-time (near-RT) control operations in Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) is increasingly critical, yet remains insufficiently addressed, as new runtime threats target the control loop while the system is operational. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.

### 8. [Velocity-Adaptive Access Scheme for Semantic-Aware Vehicular Networks: Joint Fairness and AoI Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01571v1)

Authors: Xiao Xu, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Kezhi Wang, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Khaled B. Letaief

In this paper, we address the problem of fair access and Age of Information (AoI) optimization in 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle to Everything (V2X) Mode 2. Specifically, vehicles need to exchange information with the road side unit (RSU). However, due to the varying vehicle speeds leading to different communication durations, the amount of data exchanged between different vehicles and the RSU may vary. This may poses significant safety risks in high-speed environments. To address this, we define a fairness index through tuning the selection window of different vehicles and consider the image semantic communication system to reduce latency. However, adjusting the selection window may affect the communication time, thereby impacting the AoI. Moreover, considering the re-evaluation mechanism in 5G NR, which helps reduce resource collisions, it may lead to an increase in AoI. We analyze the AoI using Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) and construct a multi-objective optimization problem to achieve fair access and AoI optimization. Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) is employed to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, and solve it using convex optimization. We also provide a large language model (LLM) based algorithm. The scheme's effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations.

Authors: David Nordlund, Luis Maßny, Antonia Wachter-Zeh, Erik G. Larsson, Zheng Chen

In the era of the Internet of Things and massive connectivity, many engineering applications, such as sensor fusion and federated edge learning, rely on efficient data aggregation from geographically distributed users over wireless networks. Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged, demonstrating strong generalization in robotic scene understanding and manipulation. However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the "how" process from the "what" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.

### 2. [Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01987v1)

Authors: Suzan Ece Ada, Georg Martius, Emre Ugur, Erhan Oztop

Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.

Authors: Wanpeng Zhang, Ye Wang, Hao Luo, Haoqi Yuan, Yicheng Feng, Sipeng Zheng, Qin Jin, Zongqing Lu

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained with flow matching have demonstrated impressive capabilities on robotic manipulation tasks. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.

### 4. [Dynamic Log-Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function for Safe Robotic Navigation in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01668v1)

Authors: Xin Yin, Chenyang Liang, Yanning Guo, Jie Mei

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as efficient tools to address the safe navigation problem for robot applications. However, synthesizing informative and obstacle motion-aware CBFs online using real-time sensor data remains challenging, particularly in unknown and dynamic scenarios. Motived by this challenge, this paper aims to propose a novel Gaussian Process-based formulation of CBF, termed the Dynamic Log Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function (DLGP-CBF), to enable real-time construction of CBF which are both spatially informative and responsive to obstacle motion. Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance, including increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness compared to baseline methods.

Authors: Mo Chen

This work presents a real-time autonomous track navigation framework for nonholonomic differential-drive mobile robots by jointly integrating multi-task visual perception and a provably stable tracking controller. The perception pipeline reconstructs lane centerlines using 2D-to-3D camera projection, arc-length based uniform point resampling, and cubic polynomial fitting solved via robust QR least-squares optimization. The controller regulates robot linear and angular velocities through a Lyapunov-stability grounded design, ensuring bounded error dynamics and asymptotic convergence of position and heading deviations even in dynamic and partially perceived lane scenarios, without relying on HD prior maps or global satellite localization. Real-world experiments on embedded platforms verify system fidelity, real-time execution, trajectory smoothness, and closed-loop stability for reliable autonomous navigation.

### 6. [EfficientFlow: Efficient Equivariant Flow Policy Learning for Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02020v1)

Authors: Jianlei Chang, Ruofeng Mei, Wei Ke, Xiangyu Xu

Generative modeling has recently shown remarkable promise for visuomotor policy learning, enabling flexible and expressive control across diverse embodied AI tasks. However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.

Authors: Elvis Hsieh, Wen-Han Hsieh, Yen-Jen Wang, Toru Lin, Jitendra Malik, Koushil Sreenath, Haozhi Qi

Reinforcement learning and sim-to-real transfer have made significant progress in dexterous manipulation. However, progress remains limited by the difficulty of simulating complex contact dynamics and multisensory signals, especially tactile feedback. In this work, we propose \ours, a sim-to-real framework that addresses these limitations and demonstrates its effectiveness on nut-bolt fastening and screwdriving with multi-fingered hands. The framework has three stages. First, we train reinforcement learning policies in simulation using simplified object models that lead to the emergence of correct finger gaits. We then use the learned policy as a skill primitive within a teleoperation system to collect real-world demonstrations that contain tactile and proprioceptive information. Finally, we train a behavior cloning policy that incorporates tactile sensing and show that it generalizes to nuts and screwdrivers with diverse geometries. Experiments across both tasks show high task progress ratios compared to direct sim-to-real transfer and robust performance even on unseen object shapes and under external perturbations.

Authors: Haoyang He, Jay Patrikar, Dong-Ki Kim, Max Smith, Daniel McGann, Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi, Shayegan Omidshafiei, Sebastian Scherer

Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.

### 9. [Real-World Robot Control by Deep Active Inference With a Temporally Hierarchical World Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01924v1)

Authors: Kentaro Fujii, Shingo Murata

Robots in uncertain real-world environments must perform both goal-directed and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions.

### 10. [Is Image-based Object Pose Estimation Ready to Support Grasping?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01856v1)

Authors: Eric C. Joyce, Qianwen Zhao, Nathaniel Burgdorfer, Long Wang, Philippos Mordohai

We present a framework for evaluating 6-DoF instance-level object pose estimators, focusing on those that require a single RGB (not RGB-D) image as input. Besides gaining intuition about how accurate these estimators are, we are interested in the degree to which they can serve as the sole perception mechanism for robotic grasping. To assess this, we perform grasping trials in a physics-based simulator, using image-based pose estimates to guide a parallel gripper and an underactuated robotic hand in picking up 3D models of objects. Our experiments on a subset of the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) dataset compare five open-source object pose estimators and provide insights that were missing from the literature.

Authors: Daniel Strassler, Gabe Elkin, Curran Schiefelbein, Daniel Herring, Ian Jessen, David Johnson, Santiago A. Paredes, Tod Shannon, Jim Flavin

Software plays an ever increasing role in complex system development and prototyping, and in recent years, MIT Lincoln Laboratory has sought to improve both the effectiveness and culture surrounding software engineering in execution of its mission. The Homeland Protection and Air Traffic Control Division conducted an internal study to examine challenges to effective and efficient research software development, and to identify ways to strengthen both the culture and execution for greater impact on our mission. Key findings of this study fell into three main categories: project attributes that influence how software development activities must be conducted and managed, potential efficiencies from centralization, opportunities to improve staffing and culture with respect to software practitioners. The study delivered actionable recommendations, including centralizing and standardizing software support tooling, developing a common database to help match the right software talent and needs to projects, and creating a software stakeholder panel to assist with continued improvement.

### 2. [Package Dashboard: A Cross-Ecosystem Framework for Dual-Perspective Analysis of Software Packages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01630v1)

Authors: Ziheng Liu, Runzhi He, Minghui Zhou

Software supply chain attacks have revealed blind spots in existing SCA tools, which are often limited to a single ecosystem and assess either software artifacts or community activity in isolation. This fragmentation across tools and ecosystems forces developers to manually reconcile scattered data, undermining risk assessments. We present Package Dashboard, a cross-ecosystem framework that provides a unified platform for supply chain analysis, enabling a holistic, dual-perspective risk assessment by integrating package metadata, vulnerability information, and upstream community health metrics. By combining dependency resolution with repository analysis, it reduces cognitive load and improves traceability. Demonstrating the framework's versatility, a large-scale study of 374,000 packages across five Linux distributions shows its ability to uncover not only conventional vulnerabilities and license conflicts but also overlooked risks such as archived or inaccessible repositories. Ultimately, Package Dashboard provides a unified view of risk, equipping developers and DevSecOps engineers with actionable insights to strengthen the transparency, trustworthiness, and traceability of open-source ecosystems. Package Dashboard is publicly available at https://github.com/n19htfall/PackageDashboard, and a demonstration video can be found at https://youtu.be/y9ncftP8KPQ.

### 3. [Large Language Models Cannot Reliably Detect Vulnerabilities in JavaScript: The First Systematic Benchmark and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01255v1)

Authors: Qingyuan Fei, Xin Liu, Song Li, Shujiang Wu, Jianwei Hou, Ping Chen, Zifeng Kang

Researchers have proposed numerous methods to detect vulnerabilities in JavaScript, especially those assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the actual capability of LLMs in JavaScript vulnerability detection remains questionable, necessitating systematic evaluation and comprehensive benchmarks. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) incomplete coverage, such as covering a limited subset of CWE types; (2) underestimation of LLM capabilities caused by unreasonable ground truth labeling; and (3) overestimation due to unrealistic cases such as using isolated vulnerable files rather than complete projects.
  In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, three principles for constructing a benchmark for JavaScript vulnerability detection that directly address these limitations: (1) comprehensiveness, (2) no underestimation, and (3) no overestimation. Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework.
  We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS. The results show that LLMs not only exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, but also suffer from severe robustness defects, indicating that reliable JavaScript vulnerability detection with LLMs remains an open challenge.

### 4. [Beyond Greenfield: AI-Driven Productivity in Documentation and Brownfield Engineering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01155v1)

Authors: Krishna Kumaar Sharma

Brownfield engineering work involving legacy systems, incomplete documentation, and fragmented architectural knowledge poses unique challenges for the effective use of large language models (LLMs). Prior research has largely focused on greenfield or synthetic tasks, leaving a gap in structured workflows for complex, context-heavy environments. This paper introduces the Discover-Define-Deliver (D3) Framework, a disciplined LLM-assisted workflow that combines role-separated prompting strategies with applied best practices for navigating ambiguity in brownfield systems. The framework incorporates a dual-agent prompting architecture in which a Builder model generates candidate outputs and a Reviewer model provides structured critique to improve reliability. I conducted an exploratory survey study with 52 software practitioners who applied the D3 workflow to real-world engineering tasks such as legacy system exploration, documentation reconstruction, and architectural refactoring. Respondents reported perceived improvements in task clarity, documentation quality, and cognitive load, along with self-estimated productivity gains. In this exploratory study, participants reported a weighted average productivity improvement of 26.9%, reduced cognitive load for approximately 77% of participants, and reduced rework for 83% during the Define phase. As these findings are self-reported and not derived from controlled experiments, they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence of practitioner sentiment rather than causal effects. The results highlight both the potential and limitations of structured LLM workflows for legacy engineering systems and motivate future controlled evaluations.

### 5. [In-context Inverse Optimality for Fair Digital Twins: A Preference-based approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01650v1)

Authors: Daniele Masti, Francesco Basciani, Arianna Fedeli, Girgio Gnecco, Francesco Smarra

Digital Twins (DTs) are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers in complex socio-technical systems. Their mathematically optimal decisions often diverge from human expectations, exposing a persistent gap between algorithmic and bounded human rationality. This work addresses this gap by proposing a framework that operationalizes fairness as a learnable objective within optimization-based Digital Twins. We introduce a preference-driven learning pipeline that infers latent fairness objectives directly from human pairwise preferences over feasible decisions. A novel Siamese neural network is developed to generate convex quadratic cost functions conditioned on contextual information. The resulting surrogate objectives align optimization outcomes with human-perceived fairness while maintaining computational efficiency. The approach is demonstrated on a COVID-19 hospital resource allocation scenario. This study provides an actionable path toward embedding human-centered fairness in the design of autonomous decision-making systems.

### 6. [BackportBench: A Multilingual Benchmark for Automated Backporting of Patches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01396v1)

Authors: Zhiqing Zhong, Jiaming Huang, Pinjia He

Many modern software projects evolve rapidly to incorporate new features and security patches. It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics.
  To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench. The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes. However, the performance varies across different programming languages. Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting.

### 7. [Generating REST API Tests With Descriptive Names](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01690v1)

Authors: Philip Garrett, Juan P. Galeotti, Andrea Arcuri, Alexander Poth, Olsi Rrjolli

Automated test generation has become a key technique for ensuring software quality, particularly in modern API-based architectures. However, automatically generated test cases are typically assigned non-descriptive names (e.g., test0, test1), which reduces their readability and hinders their usefulness during comprehension and maintenance. In this work, we present three novel deterministic techniques to generate REST API test names. We then compare eight techniques in total for generating descriptive names for REST API tests automatically produced by the fuzzer EvoMaster, using 10 test cases generated for 9 different open-source APIs. The eight techniques include rule-based heuristics and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. Their effectiveness was empirically evaluated through two surveys (involving up to 39 people recruited via LinkedIn). Our results show that a rule-based approach achieves the highest clarity ratings among deterministic methods, performs on par with state-of-the-art LLM-based models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, and significantly outperforms GPT-3.5.
  To further evaluate the practical impact of our results, an industrial case study was carried out with practitioners who actively use EvoMaster at Volkswagen AG. A developer questionnaire was then carried out based on the use of EvoMaster on four different APIs by four different users, for a total of 74 evaluated test cases. Feedback from practitioners further confirms that descriptive names produced by this approach improve test suite readability.
  These findings highlight that lightweight, deterministic techniques can serve as effective alternatives to computationally expensive and security-sensitive LLM-based approaches for automated system-level test naming, providing a practical step toward more developer-friendly API test generation.

### 8. [GPTrace: Effective Crash Deduplication Using LLM Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01609v1)

Authors: Patrick Herter, Vincent Ahlrichs, Ridvan Açilan, Julian Horsch

Fuzzing is a highly effective method for uncovering software vulnerabilities, but analyzing the resulting data typically requires substantial manual effort. This is amplified by the fact that fuzzing campaigns often find a large number of crashing inputs, many of which share the same underlying bug. Crash deduplication is the task of finding such duplicate crashing inputs and thereby reducing the data that needs to be examined. Many existing deduplication approaches rely on comparing stack traces or other information that is collected when a program crashes. Although various metrics for measuring the similarity of such pieces of information have been proposed, many do not yield satisfactory deduplication results. In this work, we present GPTrace, a deduplication workflow that leverages a large language model to evaluate the similarity of various data sources associated with crashes by computing embedding vectors and supplying those as input to a clustering algorithm. We evaluate our approach on over 300 000 crashing inputs belonging to 50 ground truth labels from 14 different targets. The deduplication results produced by GPTrace show a noticeable improvement over hand-crafted stack trace comparison methods and even more complex state-of-the-art approaches that are less flexible.

Authors: Yanlin Wang, Xinyi Xu, Jiachi Chen, Tingting Bi, Wenchao Gu, Zibin Zheng

The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a surge of interest in agents, leading to the rapid growth of agent frameworks. Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.

### 10. [LAURA: Enhancing Code Review Generation with Context-Enriched Retrieval-Augmented LLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01356v1)

Authors: Yuxin Zhang, Yuxia Zhang, Zeyu Sun, Yanjie Jiang, Hui Liu

Code review is critical for ensuring software quality and maintainability. With the rapid growth in software scale and complexity, code review has become a bottleneck in the development process because of its time-consuming and knowledge-intensive nature and the shortage of experienced developers willing to review code. Several approaches have been proposed for automatically generating code reviews based on retrieval, neural machine translation, pre-trained models, or large language models (LLMs). These approaches mainly leverage historical code changes and review comments. However, a large amount of crucial information for code review, such as the context of code changes and prior review knowledge, has been overlooked. This paper proposes an LLM-based review knowledge-augmented, context-aware framework for code review generation, named LAURA. The framework integrates review exemplar retrieval, context augmentation, and systematic guidance to enhance the performance of ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek v3 in generating code review comments. Besides, given the extensive low-quality reviews in existing datasets, we also constructed a high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that for both models, LAURA generates review comments that are either completely correct or at least helpful to developers in 42.2% and 40.4% of cases, respectively, significantly outperforming SOTA baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies demonstrate that all components of LAURA contribute positively to improving comment quality.

Authors: Junfeng Wu, Xiangmin Zhou, Erica Kuligowski, Dhirendra Singh, Enrico Ronchi, Max Kinateder

Traditional data sources on bushfire evacuation behaviour, such as quantitative surveys and manual observations have severe limitations. Mining social media data related to bushfire evacuations promises to close this gap by allowing the collection and processing of a large amount of behavioural data, which are low-cost, accurate, possibly including location information and rich contextual information. However, social media data have many limitations, such as being scattered, incomplete, informal, etc. Together, these limitations represent several challenges to their usefulness to better understand bushfire evacuation. To overcome these challenges and provide guidance on which and how social media data can be used, this scoping review of the literature reports on recent advances in relevant data mining techniques. In addition, future applications and open problems are discussed. We envision future applications such as evacuation model calibration and validation, emergency communication, personalised evacuation training, and resource allocation for evacuation preparedness. We identify open problems such as data quality, bias and representativeness, geolocation accuracy, contextual understanding, crisis-specific lexicon and semantics, and multimodal data interpretation.

Authors: Yuma Ichikawa, Yudai Fujimoto, Akira Sakai

Post-training quantization (PTQ) aims to preserve model-level behavior; however, most methods focus on individual linear layers. Even recent extensions, such as QEP and LoaQ, which mitigate error propagation or target specific submodules, still rely on layer-wise formulations and fail to capture the behavior of larger submodules. We introduce Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD), a unified framework that extends PTQ beyond layers by optimizing relaxed objectives across arbitrary submodules and projecting the solutions with layer-wise quantizers. LPCD generalizes existing methods and provides a principled approach to quantizing complex submodules while maintaining the efficiency and compatibility of layer-wise PTQ pipelines. Across diverse LLM architectures and bit-widths, LPCD-based submodule quantization consistently enhances both layer-wise PTQ methods and existing submodule approaches.

### 2. [Provably Safe Model Updates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01899v1)

Authors: Leo Elmecker-Plakolm, Pierre Fasterling, Philip Sosnin, Calvin Tsay, Matthew Wicker

Safety-critical environments are inherently dynamic. Distribution shifts, emerging vulnerabilities, and evolving requirements demand continuous updates to machine learning models. Yet even benign parameter updates can have unintended consequences, such as catastrophic forgetting in classical models or alignment drift in foundation models. Existing heuristic approaches (e.g., regularization, parameter isolation) can mitigate these effects but cannot certify that updated models continue to satisfy required performance specifications. We address this problem by introducing a framework for provably safe model updates. Our approach first formalizes the problem as computing the largest locally invariant domain (LID): a connected region in parameter space where all points are certified to satisfy a given specification. While exact maximal LID computation is intractable, we show that relaxing the problem to parameterized abstract domains (orthotopes, zonotopes) yields a tractable primal-dual formulation. This enables efficient certification of updates - independent of the data or algorithm used - by projecting them onto the safe domain. Our formulation further allows computation of multiple approximately optimal LIDs, incorporation of regularization-inspired biases, and use of lookahead data buffers. Across continual learning and foundation model fine-tuning benchmarks, our method matches or exceeds heuristic baselines for avoiding forgetting while providing formal safety guarantees.

### 3. [CLAPS: Posterior-Aware Conformal Intervals via Last-Layer Laplace](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01384v1)

Authors: Dongseok Kim, Hyoungsun Choi, Mohamed Jismy Aashik Rasool, Gisung Oh

We present CLAPS, a posterior-aware conformal regression method that pairs a Last-Layer Laplace Approximation with split-conformal calibration. From the resulting Gaussian posterior, CLAPS defines a simple two-sided posterior CDF score that aligns the conformity metric with the full predictive shape, not just a point estimate. This alignment yields narrower prediction intervals at the same target coverage, especially on small to medium tabular datasets where data are scarce and uncertainty modeling matters. We also provide a lightweight diagnostic suite that separates aleatoric and epistemic components and visualizes posterior behavior, helping practitioners understand why intervals shrink when they do. Across multiple benchmarks using the same MLP backbone, CLAPS consistently attains nominal coverage with improved efficiency and minimal overhead, offering a clear, practical upgrade to residual-based conformal baselines.

### 4. [An hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm for logistic regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01790v1)

Authors: Bernard Bercu, Luis Fredes, Eméric Gbaguidi

In this paper, we investigate a second-order stochastic algorithm for solving large-scale binary classification problems. We propose to make use of a new hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm that includes two weighted components in the Hessian matrix estimation: the first one coming from the natural Hessian estimate and the second associated with the stochastic gradient information. Our motivation comes from the fact that both parts evaluated at the true parameter of logistic regression, are equal to the Hessian matrix. This new formulation has several advantages and it enables us to prove the almost sure convergence of our stochastic algorithm to the true parameter. Moreover, we significantly improve the almost sure rate of convergence to the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, we establish the central limit theorem for our hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm. Finally, we show a surprising result on the almost sure convergence of the cumulative excess risk.

Authors: Berivan Isik, Matthew Fahrbach, Dima Kuzmin, Nicolas Mayoraz, Emil Praun, Steffen Rendle, Raghavendra Vasudeva

Online learning is the cornerstone of applications like recommendation and advertising systems, where models continuously adapt to shifting data distributions. Model training for such systems is remarkably expensive, a cost that multiplies during hyperparameter search. We introduce a two-stage paradigm to reduce this cost: (1) efficiently identifying the most promising configurations, and then (2) training only these selected candidates to their full potential. Our core insight is that focusing on accurate identification in the first stage, rather than achieving peak performance, allows for aggressive cost-saving measures. We develop novel data reduction and prediction strategies that specifically overcome the challenges of sequential, non-stationary data not addressed by conventional hyperparameter optimization. We validate our framework's effectiveness through a dual evaluation: first on the Criteo 1TB dataset, the largest suitable public benchmark, and second on an industrial advertising system operating at a scale two orders of magnitude larger. Our methods reduce the total hyperparameter search cost by up to 10$\times$ on the public benchmark and deliver significant, validated efficiency gains in the industrial setting.

### 6. [A Diffusion Model Framework for Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02019v1)

Authors: Sebastian Sanokowski, Kaustubh Patil, Alois Knoll

Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in data-driven learning and in sampling from complex, unnormalized target distributions. Building on this progress, we reinterpret Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntRL) as a diffusion model-based sampling problem. We tackle this problem by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion policy and the optimal policy distribution using a tractable upper bound. By applying the policy gradient theorem to this objective, we derive a modified surrogate objective for MaxEntRL that incorporates diffusion dynamics in a principled way. This leads to simple diffusion-based variants of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), termed DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO. All of these methods require only minor implementation changes to their base algorithm. We find that on standard continuous control benchmarks, DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO achieve better returns and higher sample efficiency than SAC and PPO.

### 7. [Differentially Private and Federated Structure Learning in Bayesian Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01708v1)

Authors: Ghita Fassy El Fehri, Aurélien Bellet, Philippe Bastien

Learning the structure of a Bayesian network from decentralized data poses two major challenges: (i) ensuring rigorous privacy guarantees for participants, and (ii) avoiding communication costs that scale poorly with dimensionality. In this work, we introduce Fed-Sparse-BNSL, a novel federated method for learning linear Gaussian Bayesian network structures that addresses both challenges. By combining differential privacy with greedy updates that target only a few relevant edges per participant, Fed-Sparse-BNSL efficiently uses the privacy budget while keeping communication costs low. Our careful algorithmic design preserves model identifiability and enables accurate structure estimation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that Fed-Sparse-BNSL achieves utility close to non-private baselines while offering substantially stronger privacy and communication efficiency.

### 8. [A Selective Temporal Hamming distance to find patterns in state transition event timeseries, at scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01440v1)

Authors: Sylvain Marié, Pablo Knecht

Discrete event systems are present both in observations of nature, socio economical sciences, and industrial systems. Standard analysis approaches do not usually exploit their dual event / state nature: signals are either modeled as transition event sequences, emphasizing event order alignment, or as categorical or ordinal state timeseries, usually resampled a distorting and costly operation as the observation period and number of events grow. In this work we define state transition event timeseries (STE-ts) and propose a new Selective Temporal Hamming distance (STH) leveraging both transition time and duration-in-state, avoiding costly and distorting resampling on large databases. STH generalizes both resampled Hamming and Jaccard metrics with better precision and computation time, and an ability to focus on multiple states of interest. We validate these benefits on simulated and real-world datasets.

### 9. [Dimension-free error estimate for diffusion model and optimal scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01820v1)

Authors: Valentin de Bortoli, Romuald Elie, Anna Kazeykina, Zhenjie Ren, Jiacheng Zhang

Diffusion generative models have emerged as powerful tools for producing synthetic data from an empirically observed distribution. A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion. Interestingly, this scheduler has appeared previously in the literature in a different context; our analysis provides a new justification for its optimality, now grounded in minimizing the discretization bias in generative sampling.

### 10. [Decision Tree Embedding by Leaf-Means](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01819v1)

Authors: Cencheng Shen, Yuexiao Dong, Carey E. Priebe

Decision trees and random forest remain highly competitive for classification on medium-sized, standard datasets due to their robustness, minimal preprocessing requirements, and interpretability. However, a single tree suffers from high estimation variance, while large ensembles reduce this variance at the cost of substantial computational overhead and diminished interpretability. In this paper, we propose Decision Tree Embedding (DTE), a fast and effective method that leverages the leaf partitions of a trained classification tree to construct an interpretable feature representation. By using the sample means within each leaf region as anchor points, DTE maps inputs into an embedding space defined by the tree's partition structure, effectively circumventing the high variance inherent in decision-tree splitting rules. We further introduce an ensemble extension based on additional bootstrap trees, and pair the resulting embedding with linear discriminant analysis for classification. We establish several population-level theoretical properties of DTE, including its preservation of conditional density under mild conditions and a characterization of the resulting classification error. Empirical studies on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that DTE strikes a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming or matching random forest and shallow neural networks while requiring only a fraction of their training time in most cases. Overall, the proposed DTE method can be viewed either as a scalable decision tree classifier that improves upon standard split rules, or as a neural network model whose weights are learned from tree-derived anchor points, achieving an intriguing integration of both paradigms.

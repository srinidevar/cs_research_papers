### Artificial Intelligence

### 1. [EchoTrail-GUI: Building Actionable Memory for GUI Agents via Critic-Guided Self-Exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19396v1)

Authors: Runze Li, Yuwen Zhai, Bo Xu, LiWu Xu, Nian Shi, Wei Zhang, Ran Lin, Liang Wang

Contemporary GUI agents, while increasingly capable due to advances in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), often operate with a critical limitation: they treat each task in isolation, lacking a mechanism to systematically learn from past successes. This digital ''amnesia'' results in sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to novel challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''. Finally, during GUI Task Inference, these memories are injected as in-context guidance to inform the agent's reasoning and decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on benchmarks including Android World and AndroidLab. The results show that EchoTrail-GUI significantly improves the task success rate and operational efficiency of baseline agents, validating the power of structured memory in creating more robust and intelligent GUI automation.

### 2. [DSTED: Decoupling Temporal Stabilization and Discriminative Enhancement for Surgical Workflow Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19387v1)

Authors: Yueyao Chen, Kai-Ni Wang, Dario Tayupo, Arnaud Huaulm'e, Krystel Nyangoh Timoh, Pierre Jannin, Qi Dou

Purpose: Surgical workflow recognition enables context-aware assistance and skill assessment in computer-assisted interventions. Despite recent advances, current methods suffer from two critical challenges: prediction jitter across consecutive frames and poor discrimination of ambiguous phases. This paper aims to develop a stable framework by selectively propagating reliable historical information and explicitly modeling uncertainty for hard sample enhancement.
  Methods: We propose a dual-pathway framework DSTED with Reliable Memory Propagation (RMP) and Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Retrieval (UPR). RMP maintains temporal coherence by filtering and fusing high-confidence historical features through multi-criteria reliability assessment. UPR constructs learnable class-specific prototypes from high-uncertainty samples and performs adaptive prototype matching to refine ambiguous frame representations. Finally, a confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways based on prediction certainty.
  Results: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing the second-best method by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations reveal complementary gains from RMP (2.19%) and UPR (1.93%), with synergistic effects when combined. Extensive analysis confirms substantial reduction in temporal jitter and marked improvement on challenging phase transitions.
  Conclusion: Our dual-pathway design introduces a novel paradigm for stable workflow recognition, demonstrating that decoupling the modeling of temporal consistency and phase ambiguity yields superior performance and clinical applicability.

### 3. [From Pixels to Predicates Structuring urban perception with scene graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19221v1)

Authors: Yunlong Liu, Shuyang Li, Pengyuan Liu, Yu Zhang, Rudi Stouffs

Perception research is increasingly modelled using streetscapes, yet many approaches still rely on pixel features or object co-occurrence statistics, overlooking the explicit relations that shape human perception. This study proposes a three stage pipeline that transforms street view imagery (SVI) into structured representations for predicting six perceptual indicators. In the first stage, each image is parsed using an open-set Panoptic Scene Graph model (OpenPSG) to extract object predicate object triplets. In the second stage, compact scene-level embeddings are learned through a heterogeneous graph autoencoder (GraphMAE). In the third stage, a neural network predicts perception scores from these embeddings. We evaluate the proposed approach against image-only baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, and cross-city generalization. Results indicate that (i) our approach improves perception prediction accuracy by an average of 26% over baseline models, and (ii) maintains strong generalization performance in cross-city prediction tasks. Additionally, the structured representation clarifies which relational patterns contribute to lower perception scores in urban scenes, such as graffiti on wall and car parked on sidewalk. Overall, this study demonstrates that graph-based structure provides expressive, generalizable, and interpretable signals for modelling urban perception, advancing human-centric and context-aware urban analytics.

### 4. [On the Koopman-Based Generalization Bounds for Multi-Task Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19199v1)

Authors: Mahdi Mohammadigohari, Giuseppe Di Fatta, Giuseppe Nicosia, Panos M. Pardalos

The paper establishes generalization bounds for multitask deep neural networks using operator-theoretic techniques. The authors propose a tighter bound than those derived from conventional norm based methods by leveraging small condition numbers in the weight matrices and introducing a tailored Sobolev space as an expanded hypothesis space. This enhanced bound remains valid even in single output settings, outperforming existing Koopman based bounds. The resulting framework maintains key advantages such as flexibility and independence from network width, offering a more precise theoretical understanding of multitask deep learning in the context of kernel methods.

### 5. [Operator-Based Generalization Bound for Deep Learning: Insights on Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19184v1)

Authors: Mahdi Mohammadigohari, Giuseppe Di Fatta, Giuseppe Nicosia, Panos M. Pardalos

This paper presents novel generalization bounds for vector-valued neural networks and deep kernel methods, focusing on multi-task learning through an operator-theoretic framework. Our key development lies in strategically combining a Koopman based approach with existing techniques, achieving tighter generalization guarantees compared to traditional norm-based bounds. To mitigate computational challenges associated with Koopman-based methods, we introduce sketching techniques applicable to vector valued neural networks. These techniques yield excess risk bounds under generic Lipschitz losses, providing performance guarantees for applications including robust and multiple quantile regression. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning framework, deep vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vvRKHS), leveraging Perron Frobenius (PF) operators to enhance deep kernel methods. We derive a new Rademacher generalization bound for this framework, explicitly addressing underfitting and overfitting through kernel refinement strategies. This work offers novel insights into the generalization properties of multitask learning with deep learning architectures, an area that has been relatively unexplored until recent developments.

### 6. [Population-Evolve: a Parallel Sampling and Evolutionary Method for LLM Math Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19081v1)

Authors: Yanzhi Zhang, Yitong Duan, Zhaoxi Zhang, Jiyan He, Shuxin Zheng

Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in last few years. In this work, we propose Population-Evolve, a training-free method inspired by Genetic Algorithms to optimize LLM reasoning. Our approach maintains a dynamic population of candidate solutions for each problem via parallel reasoning. By incorporating an evolve prompt, the LLM self-evolves its population in all iterations. Upon convergence, the final answer is derived via majority voting. Furthermore, we establish a unification framework that interprets existing test-time scaling strategies through the lens of genetic algorithms. Empirical results demonstrate that Population-Evolve achieves superior accuracy with low performance variance and computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of evolutionary strategies to unlock the reasoning power of LLMs during inference.

### 7. [Fraud Detection Through Large-Scale Graph Clustering with Heterogeneous Link Transformation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19061v1)

Authors: Chi Liu

Collaborative fraud, where multiple fraudulent accounts coordinate to exploit online payment systems, poses significant challenges due to the formation of complex network structures. Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for industrial-scale fraud detection systems.

### 8. [Recontextualization Mitigates Specification Gaming without Modifying the Specification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19027v1)

Authors: Ariana Azarbal, Victor Gillioz, Vladimir Ivanov, Bryce Woodworth, Jacob Drori, Nevan Wichers, Aram Ebtekar, Alex Cloud, Alexander Matt Turner

Developers often struggle to specify correct training labels and rewards. Perhaps they don't need to. We propose recontextualization, which reduces how often language models "game" training signals, performing misbehaviors those signals mistakenly reinforce. We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it. This mitigates the reinforcement of misbehavior from misspecified training signals, reducing specification gaming without improving the supervision signal.

### 9. [Efficient Jailbreak Mitigation Using Semantic Linear Classification in a Multi-Staged Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19011v1)

Authors: Akshaj Prashanth Rao, Advait Singh, Saumya Kumaar Saksena, Dhruv Kumar

Prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks pose persistent security challenges to large language model (LLM)-based systems. We present an efficient and systematically evaluated defense architecture that mitigates these threats through a lightweight, multi-stage pipeline. Its core component is a semantic filter based on text normalization, TF-IDF representations, and a Linear SVM classifier. Despite its simplicity, this module achieves 93.4% accuracy and 96.5% specificity on held-out data, substantially reducing attack throughput while incurring negligible computational overhead.
  Building on this efficient foundation, the full pipeline integrates complementary detection and mitigation mechanisms that operate at successive stages, providing strong robustness with minimal latency. In comparative experiments, our SVM-based configuration improves overall accuracy from 35.1% to 93.4% while reducing average time to completion from approximately 450s to 47s, yielding over 10 times lower latency than ShieldGemma. These results demonstrate that the proposed design simultaneously advances defensive precision and efficiency, addressing a core limitation of current model-based moderators.
  Evaluation across a curated corpus of over 30,000 labeled prompts, including benign, jailbreak, and application-layer injections, confirms that staged, resource-efficient defenses can robustly secure modern LLM-driven applications.

### 10. [WorldWarp: Propagating 3D Geometry with Asynchronous Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19678v1)

Authors: Hanyang Kong, Xingyi Yang, Xiaoxu Zheng, Xinchao Wang

Generating long-range, geometrically consistent video presents a fundamental dilemma: while consistency demands strict adherence to 3D geometry in pixel space, state-of-the-art generative models operate most effectively in a camera-conditioned latent space. This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a "fill-and-revise" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [Sensitivity-Aware Mixed-Precision Quantization for ReRAM-based Computing-in-Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19445v1)

Authors: Guan-Cheng Chen, Chieh-Lin Tsai, Pei-Hsuan Tsai, Yuan-Hao Chang

Compute-In-Memory (CIM) systems, particularly those utilizing ReRAM and memristive technologies, offer a promising path toward energy-efficient neural network computation. However, conventional quantization and compression techniques often fail to fully optimize performance and efficiency in these architectures. In this work, we present a structured quantization method that combines sensitivity analysis with mixed-precision strategies to enhance weight storage and computational performance on ReRAM-based CIM systems. Our approach improves ReRAM Crossbar utilization, significantly reducing power consumption, latency, and computational load, while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results show 86.33% accuracy at 70% compression, alongside a 40% reduction in power consumption, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for power-constrained applications.

### 2. [Binary Neural Network Implementation for Handwritten Digit Recognition on FPGA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19304v1)

Authors: Emir Devlet Ertörer, Cem Ünsalan

Binary neural networks provide a promising solution for low-power, high-speed inference by replacing expensive floating-point operations with bitwise logic. This makes them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained platforms such as FPGAs. In this study, we present a fully custom BNN inference accelerator for handwritten digit recognition, implemented entirely in Verilog without the use of high-level synthesis tools. The design targets the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and achieves real-time classification at 80\,MHz with low power consumption and predictable timing. Simulation results demonstrate 84\% accuracy on the MNIST test set and highlight the advantages of manual HDL design for transparent, efficient, and flexible BNN deployment in embedded systems. The complete project including training scripts and Verilog source code are available at GitHub repo for reproducibility and future development.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [Negations are powerful even in small depth](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19515v1)

Authors: Bruno Cavalar, Théo Borém Fabris, Partha Mukhopadhyay, Srikanth Srinivasan, Amir Yehudayoff

We study the power of negation in the Boolean and algebraic settings and show the following results.
  * We construct a family of polynomials $P_n$ in $n$ variables, all of whose monomials have positive coefficients, such that $P_n$ can be computed by a depth three circuit of polynomial size but any monotone circuit computing it has size $2^{Ω(n)}$. This is the strongest possible separation result between monotone and non-monotone arithmetic computations and improves upon all earlier results, including the seminal work of Valiant (1980) and more recently by Chattopadhyay, Datta, and Mukhopadhyay (2021). We then boot-strap this result to prove strong monotone separations for polynomials of constant degree, which solves an open problem from the survey of Shpilka and Yehudayoff (2010).
  * By moving to the Boolean setting, we can prove superpolynomial monotone Boolean circuit lower bounds for specific Boolean functions, which imply that all the powers of certain monotone polynomials cannot be computed by polynomially sized monotone arithmetic circuits.
  * We then define a collection of problems with linear-algebraic nature, which are similar to span programs, and prove monotone Boolean circuit lower bounds for them. In particular, this gives the strongest known monotone lower bounds for functions in uniform (non-monotone) $\textbf{NC}^2$. Our construction also leads to an explicit matroid that defines a monotone function that is difficult to compute, which solves an open problem by Jukna and Seiwert (2020).
  Our monotone arithmetic and Boolean circuit lower bounds are based on known techniques, such as reduction from monotone arithmetic complexity to multipartition communication complexity and the approximation method for proving lower bounds for monotone Boolean circuits, but we overcome several new challenges in order to obtain efficient upper bounds using low-depth circuits.

### 2. [Classical billiards can compute](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19156v1)

Authors: Eva Miranda, Isaac Ramos

We show that two-dimensional billiard systems are Turing complete by encoding their dynamics within the framework of Topological Kleene Field Theory. Billiards serve as idealized models of particle motion with elastic reflections and arise naturally as limits of smooth Hamiltonian systems under steep confining potentials. Our results establish the existence of undecidable trajectories in physically natural billiard-type models, including billiard-type models arising in hard-sphere gases and in collision-chain limits of celestial mechanics.

### 3. [On the complexity of computing Strahler numbers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19060v1)

Authors: Moses Ganardi, Markus Lohrey

It is shown that the problem of computing the Strahler number of a binary tree given as a term is complete for the circuit complexity class uniform $\mathsf{NC}^1$. For several variants, where the binary tree is given by a pointer structure or in a succinct form by a directed acyclic graph or a tree straight-line program, the complexity of computing the Strahler number is determined as well. The problem, whether a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form produces a derivation tree (resp., an acyclic derivation tree), whose Strahler number is at least a given number $k$ is shown to be P-complete (resp., PSPACE-complete).

### Computational Engineering

### 1. [The Best of Both Worlds: Hybridizing Neural Operators and Solvers for Stable Long-Horizon Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19643v1)

Authors: Rajyasri Roy, Dibyajyoti Nayak, Somdatta Goswami

Numerical simulation of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is central to scientific and engineering applications, but high-fidelity solvers are often prohibitively expensive for long-horizon or time-critical settings. Neural operator (NO) surrogates offer fast inference across parametric and functional inputs; however, most autoregressive NO frameworks remain vulnerable to compounding errors, and ensemble-averaged metrics provide limited guarantees for individual inference trajectories. In practice, error accumulation can become unacceptable beyond the training horizon, and existing methods lack mechanisms for online monitoring or correction. To address this gap, we propose ANCHOR (Adaptive Numerical Correction for High-fidelity Operator Rollouts), an online, instance-aware hybrid inference framework for stable long-horizon prediction of nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs. ANCHOR treats a pretrained NO as the primary inference engine and adaptively couples it with a classical numerical solver using a physics-informed, residual-based error estimator. Inspired by adaptive time-stepping in numerical analysis, ANCHOR monitors an exponential moving average (EMA) of the normalized PDE residual to detect accumulating error and trigger corrective solver interventions without requiring access to ground-truth solutions. We show that the EMA-based estimator correlates strongly with the true relative L2 error, enabling data-free, instance-aware error control during inference. Evaluations on four canonical PDEs: 1D and 2D Burgers', 2D Allen-Cahn, and 3D heat conduction, demonstrate that ANCHOR reliably bounds long-horizon error growth, stabilizes extrapolative rollouts, and significantly improves robustness over standalone neural operators, while remaining substantially more efficient than high-fidelity numerical solvers.

### 2. [GLUE: Generative Latent Unification of Expertise-Informed Engineering Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19469v1)

Authors: Tim Aebersold, Soheyl Massoudi, Mark D. Fuge

Engineering complex systems (aircraft, buildings, vehicles) requires accounting for geometric and performance couplings across subsystems. As generative models proliferate for specialized domains (wings, structures, engines), a key research gap is how to coordinate frozen, pre-trained submodels to generate full-system designs that are feasible, diverse, and high-performing. We introduce Generative Latent Unification of Expertise-Informed Engineering Models (GLUE), which orchestrates pre-trained, frozen subsystem generators while enforcing system-level feasibility, optimality, and diversity. We propose and benchmark (i) data-driven GLUE models trained on pre-generated system-level designs and (ii) a data-free GLUE model trained online on a differentiable geometry layer. On a UAV design problem with five coupling constraints, we find that data-driven approaches yield diverse, high-performing designs but require large datasets to satisfy constraints reliably. The data-free approach is competitive with Bayesian optimization and gradient-based optimization in performance and feasibility while training a full generative model in only 10 min on a RTX 4090 GPU, requiring more than two orders of magnitude fewer geometry evaluations and FLOPs than the data-driven method. Ablations focused on data-free training show that subsystem output continuity affects coordination, and equality constraints can trigger mode collapse unless mitigated. By integrating unmodified, domain-informed submodels into a modular generative workflow, this work provides a viable path for scaling generative design to complex, real-world engineering systems.

### 3. [Mixed formulation and structure-preserving discretization of Cosserat rod dynamics in a port-Hamiltonian framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19408v1)

Authors: Philipp L. Kinon, Simon R. Eugster, Peter Betsch

An energy-based modeling framework for the nonlinear dynamics of spatial Cosserat rods undergoing large displacements and rotations is proposed. The mixed formulation features independent displacement, velocity and stress variables and is further objective and locking-free. Finite rotations are represented using a director formulation that avoids singularities and yields a constant mass matrix. This results in an infinite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (PH) system governed by partial differential-algebraic equations with a quadratic energy functional. Using a time-differentiated compliance form of the stress-strain relations allows for the imposition of kinematic constraints, such as inextensibility or shear-rigidity. A structure-preserving finite element discretization leads to a finite-dimensional system with PH structure, thus facilitating the design of an energy-momentum consistent integration scheme. Dissipative material behavior (via the generalized-Maxwell model) and non-standard actuation approaches (via pneumatic chambers or tendons) integrate naturally into the framework. As illustrated by selected numerical examples, the present framework establishes a new approach to energy-momentum consistent formulations in computational mechanics involving finite rotations.

### Computation and Language

### 1. [HATS: High-Accuracy Triple-Set Watermarking for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19378v1)

Authors: Zhiqing Hu, Chenxu Zhao, Jiazhong Lu, Xiaolei Liu

Misuse of LLM-generated text can be curbed by watermarking techniques that embed implicit signals into the output. We propose a watermark that partitions the vocabulary at each decoding step into three sets (Green/Yellow/Red) with fixed ratios and restricts sampling to the Green and Yellow sets. At detection time, we replay the same partitions, compute Green-enrichment and Red-depletion statistics, convert them to one-sided z-scores, and aggregate their p-values via Fisher's method to decide whether a passage is watermarked. We implement generation, detection, and testing on Llama 2 7B, and evaluate true-positive rate, false-positive rate, and text quality. Results show that the triple-partition scheme achieves high detection accuracy at fixed FPR while preserving readability.

### 2. [CienaLLM: Generative Climate-Impact Extraction from News Articles with Autoregressive LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19305v1)

Authors: Javier Vela-Tambo, Jorge Gracia, Fernando Dominguez-Castro

Understanding and monitoring the socio-economic impacts of climate hazards requires extracting structured information from heterogeneous news articles on a large scale. To that end, we have developed CienaLLM, a modular framework based on schema-guided Generative Information Extraction. CienaLLM uses open-weight Large Language Models for zero-shot information extraction from news articles, and supports configurable prompts and output schemas, multi-step pipelines, and cloud or on-premise inference. To systematically assess how the choice of LLM family, size, precision regime, and prompting strategy affect performance, we run a large factorial study in models, precisions, and prompt engineering techniques. An additional response parsing step nearly eliminates format errors while preserving accuracy; larger models deliver the strongest and most stable performance, while quantization offers substantial efficiency gains with modest accuracy trade-offs; and prompt strategies show heterogeneous, model-specific effects. CienaLLM matches or outperforms the supervised baseline in accuracy for extracting drought impacts from Spanish news, although at a higher inference cost. While evaluated in droughts, the schema-driven and model-agnostic design is suitable for adapting to related information extraction tasks (e.g., other hazards, sectors, or languages) by editing prompts and schemas rather than retraining. We release code, configurations, and schemas to support reproducible use.

### 3. [CycleChart: A Unified Consistency-Based Learning Framework for Bidirectional Chart Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19173v1)

Authors: Dazhen Deng, Sen Yang, Yuchen He, Yuan Tian, Yingcai Wu

Current chart-specific tasks, such as chart question answering, chart parsing, and chart generation, are typically studied in isolation, preventing models from learning the shared semantics that link chart generation and interpretation. We introduce CycleChart, a consistency-based learning framework for bidirectional chart understanding and generation. CycleChart adopts a schema-centric formulation as a common interface across tasks. We construct a consistent multi-task dataset, where each chart sample includes aligned annotations for schema prediction, data parsing, and question answering. To learn cross-directional chart semantics, CycleChart introduces a generate-parse consistency objective: the model generates a chart schema from a table and a textual query, then learns to recover the schema and data from the generated chart, enforcing semantic alignment across directions. CycleChart achieves strong results on chart generation, chart parsing, and chart question answering, demonstrating improved cross-task generalization and marking a step toward more general chart understanding models.

### 4. [DramaBench: A Six-Dimensional Evaluation Framework for Drama Script Continuation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19012v1)

Authors: Shijian Ma, Yunqi Huang, Yan Lin

Drama script continuation requires models to maintain character consistency, advance plot coherently, and preserve dramatic structurecapabilities that existing benchmarks fail to evaluate comprehensively. We present DramaBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating drama script continuation across six independent dimensions: Format Standards, Narrative Efficiency, Character Consistency, Emotional Depth, Logic Consistency, and Conflict Handling. Our framework combines rulebased analysis with LLM-based labeling and statistical metrics, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art language models on 1,103 scripts (8,824 evaluations total), with rigorous statistical significance testing (252 pairwise comparisons, 65.9% significant) and human validation (188 scripts, substantial agreement on 3/5 dimensions). Our ablation studies confirm all six dimensions capture independent quality aspects (mean | r | = 0.020). DramaBench provides actionable, dimensionspecific feedback for model improvement and establishes a rigorous standard for creative writing evaluation.

### 6. [Kunnafonidilaw ka Cadeau: an ASR dataset of present-day Bambara](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19400v1)

Authors: Yacouba Diarra, Panga Azazia Kamate, Nouhoum Souleymane Coulibaly, Michael Leventhal

We present Kunkado, a 160-hour Bambara ASR dataset compiled from Malian radio archives to capture present-day spontaneous speech across a wide range of topics. It includes code-switching, disfluencies, background noise, and overlapping speakers that practical ASR systems encounter in real-world use. We finetuned Parakeet-based models on a 33.47-hour human-reviewed subset and apply pragmatic transcript normalization to reduce variability in number formatting, tags, and code-switching annotations. Evaluated on two real-world test sets, finetuning with Kunkado reduces WER from 44.47\% to 37.12\% on one and from 36.07\% to 32.33\% on the other. In human evaluation, the resulting model also outperforms a comparable system with the same architecture trained on 98 hours of cleaner, less realistic speech. We release the data and models to support robust ASR for predominantly oral languages.

### 7. [Exploring the features used for summary evaluation by Human and GPT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19620v1)

Authors: Zahra Sadeghi, Evangelos Milios, Frank Rudzicz

Summary assessment involves evaluating how well a generated summary reflects the key ideas and meaning of the source text, requiring a deep understanding of the content. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to automate this process, acting as judges to evaluate summaries with respect to the original text. While previous research investigated the alignment between LLMs and Human responses, it is not yet well understood what properties or features are exploited by them when asked to evaluate based on a particular quality dimension, and there has not been much attention towards mapping between evaluation scores and metrics. In this paper, we address this issue and discover features aligned with Human and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) responses by studying statistical and machine learning metrics. Furthermore, we show that instructing GPTs to employ metrics used by Human can improve their judgment and conforming them better with human responses.

### 8. [A Large-Language-Model Framework for Automated Humanitarian Situation Reporting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19475v1)

Authors: Ivan Decostanzi, Yelena Mejova, Kyriaki Kalimeri

Timely and accurate situational reports are essential for humanitarian decision-making, yet current workflows remain largely manual, resource intensive, and inconsistent. We present a fully automated framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to transform heterogeneous humanitarian documents into structured and evidence-grounded reports. The system integrates semantic text clustering, automatic question generation, retrieval augmented answer extraction with citations, multi-level summarization, and executive summary generation, supported by internal evaluation metrics that emulate expert reasoning. We evaluated the framework across 13 humanitarian events, including natural disasters and conflicts, using more than 1,100 documents from verified sources such as ReliefWeb. The generated questions achieved 84.7 percent relevance, 84.0 percent importance, and 76.4 percent urgency. The extracted answers reached 86.3 percent relevance, with citation precision and recall both exceeding 76 percent. Agreement between human and LLM based evaluations surpassed an F1 score of 0.80. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed framework produces reports that are more structured, interpretable, and actionable than existing baselines. By combining LLM reasoning with transparent citation linking and multi-level evaluation, this study demonstrates that generative AI can autonomously produce accurate, verifiable, and operationally useful humanitarian situation reports.

### 9. [SiamGPT: Quality-First Fine-Tuning for Stable Thai Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19455v1)

Authors: Thittipat Pairatsuppawat, Abhibhu Tachaapornchai, Paweekorn Kusolsomboon, Chutikan Chaiwong, Thodsaporn Chay-intr, Kobkrit Viriyayudhakorn, Nongnuch Ketui, Aslan B. Wong

Open-weights large language models remain difficult to deploy for Thai due to unstable generation under complex instructions, despite strong English performance. To mitigate these limitations, We present SiamGPT-32B, an open-weights model based on Qwen3-32B, fine-tuned with a Quality-First strategy emphasizing curated supervision over data scale. The fine-tuning pipeline combines translated high-complexity English instruction data with a Thai-adapted AutoIF framework for instruction and linguistic constraints. Using supervised fine-tuning only, without continual pretraining or corpus expansion, SiamGPT-32B improves instruction adherence, multi-turn robustness, and linguistic stability. Evaluations on the SEA-HELM benchmark show that SiamGPT-32B achieves the strongest overall performance among similar-scale open-weights Thai models, with consistent gains in instruction following, multi-turn dialogue, and natural language understanding.

Authors: Walter Quattrociocchi, Valerio Capraro, Matjaž Perc

Large language models (LLMs) are widely described as artificial intelligence, yet their epistemic profile diverges sharply from human cognition. Here we show that the apparent alignment between human and machine outputs conceals a deeper structural mismatch in how judgments are produced. Tracing the historical shift from symbolic AI and information filtering systems to large-scale generative transformers, we argue that LLMs are not epistemic agents but stochastic pattern-completion systems, formally describable as walks on high-dimensional graphs of linguistic transitions rather than as systems that form beliefs or models of the world. By systematically mapping human and artificial epistemic pipelines, we identify seven epistemic fault lines, divergences in grounding, parsing, experience, motivation, causal reasoning, metacognition, and value. We call the resulting condition Epistemia: a structural situation in which linguistic plausibility substitutes for epistemic evaluation, producing the feeling of knowing without the labor of judgment. We conclude by outlining consequences for evaluation, governance, and epistemic literacy in societies increasingly organized around generative AI.

Authors: Sameera K. M., Serena Nicolazzo, Antonino Nocera, Vinod P., Rafidha Rehiman K. A

Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a revolutionary approach to collaborative training Machine Learning models. In particular, it enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy, but its distributed nature makes it highly vulnerable to a severe attack known as Data Poisoning. In such scenarios, malicious clients inject manipulated data into the training process, thereby degrading global model performance or causing targeted misclassification. In this paper, we present a novel defense mechanism called GShield, designed to detect and mitigate malicious and low-quality updates, especially under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data scenarios. GShield operates by learning the distribution of benign gradients through clustering and Gaussian modeling during an initial round, enabling it to establish a reliable baseline of trusted client behavior. With this benign profile, GShield selectively aggregates only those updates that align with the expected gradient patterns, effectively isolating adversarial clients and preserving the integrity of the global model. An extensive experimental campaign demonstrates that our proposed defense significantly improves model robustness compared to the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a high accuracy of performance across both tabular and image datasets. Furthermore, GShield improves the accuracy of the targeted class by 43\% to 65\% after detecting malicious and low-quality clients.

### 2. [Evaluating MCC for Low-Frequency Cyberattack Detection in Imbalanced Intrusion Detection Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19203v1)

Authors: Prameshwar Thiyagarajan, Chad A. Williams

In many real-world network environments, several types of cyberattacks occur at very low rates compared to benign traffic, making them difficult for intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect reliably. This imbalance causes traditional evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, to often overstate model performance in these conditions, masking failures on minority attack classes that are most important in practice. In this paper, we evaluate a set of base and meta classifiers on low-traffic attacks in the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset and compare their reliability in terms of accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The results show that accuracy consistently inflates performance, while MCC provides a more accurate assessment of a classifier's performance across both majority and minority classes. Meta-classification methods, such as LogitBoost and AdaBoost, demonstrate more effective minority class detection when measured by MCC, revealing trends that accuracy fails to capture. These findings establish the need for imbalance-aware evaluation and make MCC a more trustworthy metric for IDS research involving low-traffic cyberattacks.

Authors: Md Minhazul Islam Munna, Md Mahbubur Rahman, Jaroslav Frnda, Muhammad Shahid Anwar, Alpamis Kutlimuratov

The proliferation of IoT devices and their reliance on Wi-Fi networks have introduced significant security vulnerabilities, particularly the KRACK and Kr00k attacks, which exploit weaknesses in WPA2 encryption to intercept and manipulate sensitive data. Traditional IDS using classifiers face challenges such as model overfitting, incomplete feature extraction, and high false positive rates, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a robust multiclass machine learning based intrusion detection framework. The methodology integrates advanced feature selection techniques to identify critical attributes, mitigating redundancy and enhancing detection accuracy. Two distinct ML architectures are implemented: a baseline classifier pipeline and a stacked ensemble model combining noise injection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and meta learning to improve generalization and reduce false positives. Evaluated on the AWID3 data set, the proposed ensemble architecture achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 98%, precision of 98%, recall of 98%, and a false positive rate of just 2%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. This work demonstrates the efficacy of combining preprocessing strategies with ensemble learning to fortify network security against sophisticated Wi-Fi attacks, offering a scalable and reliable solution for IoT environments. Future directions include real-time deployment and adversarial resilience testing to further enhance the model's adaptability.

Authors: Liming Lu, Xiang Gu, Junyu Huang, Jiawei Du, Yunhuai Liu, Yongbin Zhou, Shuchao Pang

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic systems, where their interactions with diverse tools and environments create complex, multi-stage safety challenges. However, existing benchmarks mostly rely on static, single-turn assessments that miss vulnerabilities from adaptive, long-chain attacks. To fill this gap, we introduce DREAM, a framework for systematic evaluation of LLM agents against dynamic, multi-stage attacks. At its core, DREAM uses a Cross-Environment Adversarial Knowledge Graph (CE-AKG) to maintain stateful, cross-domain understanding of vulnerabilities. This graph guides a Contextualized Guided Policy Search (C-GPS) algorithm that dynamically constructs attack chains from a knowledge base of 1,986 atomic actions across 349 distinct digital environments. Our evaluation of 12 leading LLM agents reveals a critical vulnerability: these attack chains succeed in over 70% of cases for most models, showing the power of stateful, cross-environment exploits. Through analysis of these failures, we identify two key weaknesses in current agents: contextual fragility, where safety behaviors fail to transfer across environments, and an inability to track long-term malicious intent. Our findings also show that traditional safety measures, such as initial defense prompts, are largely ineffective against attacks that build context over multiple interactions. To advance agent safety research, we release DREAM as a tool for evaluating vulnerabilities and developing more robust defenses.

### 5. [Efficient Jailbreak Mitigation Using Semantic Linear Classification in a Multi-Staged Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19011v1)

Authors: Akshaj Prashanth Rao, Advait Singh, Saumya Kumaar Saksena, Dhruv Kumar

Prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks pose persistent security challenges to large language model (LLM)-based systems. We present an efficient and systematically evaluated defense architecture that mitigates these threats through a lightweight, multi-stage pipeline. Its core component is a semantic filter based on text normalization, TF-IDF representations, and a Linear SVM classifier. Despite its simplicity, this module achieves 93.4% accuracy and 96.5% specificity on held-out data, substantially reducing attack throughput while incurring negligible computational overhead.
  Building on this efficient foundation, the full pipeline integrates complementary detection and mitigation mechanisms that operate at successive stages, providing strong robustness with minimal latency. In comparative experiments, our SVM-based configuration improves overall accuracy from 35.1% to 93.4% while reducing average time to completion from approximately 450s to 47s, yielding over 10 times lower latency than ShieldGemma. These results demonstrate that the proposed design simultaneously advances defensive precision and efficiency, addressing a core limitation of current model-based moderators.
  Evaluation across a curated corpus of over 30,000 labeled prompts, including benign, jailbreak, and application-layer injections, confirms that staged, resource-efficient defenses can robustly secure modern LLM-driven applications.

Authors: Haotian Deng, Mengxuan Liu, Chuan Zhang, Wei Huang, Licheng Wang, Liehuang Zhu

Online harassment, incitement to violence, racist behavior, and other harmful content on social media can damage social harmony and even break the law. Traditional blocklisting technologies can block malicious users, but this comes at the expense of identity privacy. The anonymous blocklisting has emerged as an effective mechanism to restrict the abuse of freedom of speech while protecting user identity privacy. However, the state-of-the-art anonymous blocklisting schemes suffer from either poor dynamism or low efficiency. In this paper, we propose $\mathsf{ShadowBlock}$, an efficient dynamic anonymous blocklisting scheme. Specifically, we utilize the pseudorandom function and cryptographic accumulator to construct the public blocklisting, enabling users to prove they are not on the blocklisting in an anonymous manner. To improve verification efficiency, we design an aggregation zero-knowledge proof mechanism that converts multiple verification operations into a single one. In addition, we leverage the accumulator's property to achieve efficient updates of the blocklisting, i.e., the original proof can be reused with minimal updates rather than regenerating the entire proof. Experiments show that $\mathsf{ShadowBlock}$ has better dynamics and efficiency than the existing schemes. Finally, the discussion on applications indicates that $\mathsf{ShadowBlock}$ also holds significant value and has broad prospects in emerging fields such as cross-chain identity management.

Authors: Pradyun Parayil, Amal Raj, Vivek Balachandran

Quantum circuit obfuscation is becoming increasingly important to prevent theft and reverse engineering of quantum algorithms. As quantum computing advances, the need to protect the intellectual property contained in quantum circuits continues to grow. Existing methods often provide limited defense against structural and statistical analysis or introduce considerable overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum obfuscation method that uses randomized U3 transformations to conceal circuit structure while preserving functionality. We implement and assess our approach on QASM circuits using Qiskit AER, achieving over 93\% semantic accuracy with minimal runtime overhead. The method demonstrates strong resistance to reverse engineering and structural inference, making it a practical and effective approach for quantum software protection.

Authors: Navin Chhibber, Amber Rastogi, Ankur Mahida, Vatsal Gupta, Piyush Ranjan

Another threat is the development of large quantum computers, which have a high likelihood of breaking the high popular security protocols because it can use both Shor and Grover algorithms. In order to fix this looming threat, quantum-resistant cryptographic systems, otherwise known as post-quantum cryptography (PQC), are being formulated to protect cybersecurity systems of the future. The current paper presents the state of the art in designing, realizing, and testing the security of robust quantum-resistant algorithms, paying attention to lattice-based, code-based, multivariate polynomial and hash-based cryptography. We discuss their resistance to classical and quantum attackers, distributed system scalability properties, and their deployment in practice (secure communications, blockchain, cloud computing infrastructures). Also, we study a hybrid cryptographic model that integrates the classical efficient cryptography scheme and a quantum-resilient cryptographic scheme to achieve a backward-compatible solution and simultaneously improving the forward security properties. With the experimental findings, it is evident that performance with reasonable computational footprint of the proposed framework succeeds to install amplified security fortitude which successfully harbours prolific cybersecurity systems of the future.

### 9. [DPSR: Differentially Private Sparse Reconstruction via Multi-Stage Denoising for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18932v1)

Authors: Sarwan Ali

Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as the gold standard for protecting user data in recommender systems, but existing privacy-preserving mechanisms face a fundamental challenge: the privacy-utility tradeoff inevitably degrades recommendation quality as privacy budgets tighten. We introduce DPSR (Differentially Private Sparse Reconstruction), a novel three-stage denoising framework that fundamentally addresses this limitation by exploiting the inherent structure of rating matrices -- sparsity, low-rank properties, and collaborative patterns.
  DPSR consists of three synergistic stages: (1) \textit{information-theoretic noise calibration} that adaptively reduces noise for high-information ratings, (2) \textit{collaborative filtering-based denoising} that leverages item-item similarities to remove privacy noise, and (3) \textit{low-rank matrix completion} that exploits latent structure for signal recovery. Critically, all denoising operations occur \textit{after} noise injection, preserving differential privacy through the post-processing immunity theorem while removing both privacy-induced and inherent data noise.
  Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled ground truth, we demonstrate that DPSR achieves 5.57\% to 9.23\% RMSE improvement over state-of-the-art Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms across privacy budgets ranging from $\varepsilon=0.1$ to $\varepsilon=10.0$ (all improvements statistically significant with $p < 0.05$, most $p < 0.001$). Remarkably, at $\varepsilon=1.0$, DPSR achieves RMSE of 0.9823, \textit{outperforming even the non-private baseline} (1.0983), demonstrating that our denoising pipeline acts as an effective regularizer that removes data noise in addition to privacy noise.

### 10. [From Retrieval to Reasoning: A Framework for Cyber Threat Intelligence NER with Explicit and Adaptive Instructions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19414v1)

Authors: Jiaren Peng, Hongda Sun, Xuan Tian, Cheng Huang, Zeqing Li, Rui Yan

The automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) relies heavily on Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract critical entities from unstructured text. Currently, Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily address this task through retrieval-based In-Context Learning (ICL). This paper analyzes this mainstream paradigm, revealing a fundamental flaw: its success stems not from global semantic similarity but largely from the incidental overlap of entity types within retrieved examples. This exposes the limitations of relying on unreliable implicit induction. To address this, we propose TTPrompt, a framework shifting from implicit induction to explicit instruction. TTPrompt maps the core concepts of CTI's Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) into an instruction hierarchy: formulating task definitions as Tactics, guiding strategies as Techniques, and annotation guidelines as Procedures. Furthermore, to handle the adaptability challenge of static guidelines, we introduce Feedback-driven Instruction Refinement (FIR). FIR enables LLMs to self-refine guidelines by learning from errors on minimal labeled data, adapting to distinct annotation dialects. Experiments on five CTI NER benchmarks demonstrate that TTPrompt consistently surpasses retrieval-based baselines. Notably, with refinement on just 1% of training data, it rivals models fine-tuned on the full dataset. For instance, on LADDER, its Micro F1 of 71.96% approaches the fine-tuned baseline, and on the complex CTINexus, its Macro F1 exceeds the fine-tuned ACLM model by 10.91%.

Authors: Yujie Zhao, Hongwei Fan, Di Chen, Shengcong Chen, Liliang Chen, Xiaoqi Li, Guanghui Ren, Hao Dong

Recent progress in robot learning has been driven by large-scale datasets and powerful visuomotor policy architectures, yet policy robustness remains limited by the substantial cost of collecting diverse demonstrations, particularly for spatial generalization in manipulation tasks. To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.

Authors: Yueyao Chen, Kai-Ni Wang, Dario Tayupo, Arnaud Huaulm'e, Krystel Nyangoh Timoh, Pierre Jannin, Qi Dou

Purpose: Surgical workflow recognition enables context-aware assistance and skill assessment in computer-assisted interventions. Despite recent advances, current methods suffer from two critical challenges: prediction jitter across consecutive frames and poor discrimination of ambiguous phases. This paper aims to develop a stable framework by selectively propagating reliable historical information and explicitly modeling uncertainty for hard sample enhancement.
  Methods: We propose a dual-pathway framework DSTED with Reliable Memory Propagation (RMP) and Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Retrieval (UPR). RMP maintains temporal coherence by filtering and fusing high-confidence historical features through multi-criteria reliability assessment. UPR constructs learnable class-specific prototypes from high-uncertainty samples and performs adaptive prototype matching to refine ambiguous frame representations. Finally, a confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways based on prediction certainty.
  Results: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing the second-best method by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations reveal complementary gains from RMP (2.19%) and UPR (1.93%), with synergistic effects when combined. Extensive analysis confirms substantial reduction in temporal jitter and marked improvement on challenging phase transitions.
  Conclusion: Our dual-pathway design introduces a novel paradigm for stable workflow recognition, demonstrating that decoupling the modeling of temporal consistency and phase ambiguity yields superior performance and clinical applicability.

### 3. [ReasonCD: A Multimodal Reasoning Large Model for Implicit Change-of-Interest Semantic Mining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19354v1)

Authors: Zhenyang Huang, Xiao Yu, Yi Zhang, Decheng Wang, Hang Ruan

Remote sensing image change detection is one of the fundamental tasks in remote sensing intelligent interpretation. Its core objective is to identify changes within change regions of interest (CRoI). Current multimodal large models encode rich human semantic knowledge, which is utilized for guidance in tasks such as remote sensing change detection. However, existing methods that use semantic guidance for detecting users' CRoI overly rely on explicit textual descriptions of CRoI, leading to the problem of near-complete performance failure when presented with implicit CRoI textual descriptions. This paper proposes a multimodal reasoning change detection model named ReasonCD, capable of mining users' implicit task intent. The model leverages the powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained large language models to mine users' implicit task intents and subsequently obtains different change detection results based on these intents. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the model achieves excellent change detection performance, with an F1 score of 92.1\% on the BCDD dataset. Furthermore, to validate its superior reasoning functionality, this paper annotates a subset of reasoning data based on the SECOND dataset. Experimental results show that the model not only excels at basic reasoning-based change detection tasks but can also explain the reasoning process to aid human decision-making.

Authors: Yueting Zhu, Yuehao Song, Shuai Zhang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang

Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are typically analyzed using multiple instance learning (MIL) methods. However, the scale and heterogeneity of WSIs generate highly redundant and dispersed information, making it difficult to identify and integrate discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches, which restricts their performance on large and heterogeneous WSIs. To address this issue, we propose DeltaMIL, a novel MIL framework that explicitly selects semantically relevant regions and integrates the discriminative information from WSIs. Our method leverages the gated delta rule to efficiently filter and integrate information through a block combining forgetting and memory mechanisms. The delta mechanism dynamically updates the memory by removing old values and inserting new ones according to their correlation with the current patch. The gating mechanism further enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Additionally, DeltaMIL integrates a complementary local pattern mixing mechanism to retain fine-grained pathological locality. Our design enhances the extraction of meaningful cues and suppresses redundant or noisy information, which improves the model's robustness and discriminative power. Experiments demonstrate that DeltaMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for survival prediction, DeltaMIL improves performance by 3.69\% using ResNet-50 features and 2.36\% using UNI features. For slide-level classification, it increases accuracy by 3.09\% with ResNet-50 features and 3.75\% with UNI features. These results demonstrate the strong and consistent performance of DeltaMIL across diverse WSI tasks.

### 5. [Bridging Semantics and Geometry: A Decoupled LVLM-SAM Framework for Reasoning Segmentation in Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19302v1)

Authors: Xu Zhang, Junyao Ge, Yang Zheng, Kaitai Guo, Jimin Liang

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold great promise for advancing remote sensing (RS) analysis, yet existing reasoning segmentation frameworks couple linguistic reasoning and pixel prediction through end-to-end supervised fine-tuning, leading to weak geometric grounding and limited generalization across tasks. To address this, we developed Think2Seg-RS, a decoupled framework that trains an LVLM prompter to control a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) via structured geometric prompts. Through a mask-only reinforcement learning objective, the LVLM learns to translate abstract semantic reasoning into spatially grounded actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the EarthReason dataset. Remarkably, the learned prompting policy generalizes zero-shot to multiple referring segmentation benchmarks, exposing a distinct divide between semantic-level and instance-level grounding. We further found that compact segmenters outperform larger ones under semantic-level supervision, and that negative prompts are ineffective in heterogeneous aerial backgrounds. Together, these findings establish semantic-level reasoning segmentation as a new paradigm for geospatial understanding, opening the way toward unified, interpretable LVLM-driven Earth observation. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/Ricardo-XZ/Think2Seg-RS.

Authors: Yunlong Liu, Shuyang Li, Pengyuan Liu, Yu Zhang, Rudi Stouffs

Perception research is increasingly modelled using streetscapes, yet many approaches still rely on pixel features or object co-occurrence statistics, overlooking the explicit relations that shape human perception. This study proposes a three stage pipeline that transforms street view imagery (SVI) into structured representations for predicting six perceptual indicators. In the first stage, each image is parsed using an open-set Panoptic Scene Graph model (OpenPSG) to extract object predicate object triplets. In the second stage, compact scene-level embeddings are learned through a heterogeneous graph autoencoder (GraphMAE). In the third stage, a neural network predicts perception scores from these embeddings. We evaluate the proposed approach against image-only baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, and cross-city generalization. Results indicate that (i) our approach improves perception prediction accuracy by an average of 26% over baseline models, and (ii) maintains strong generalization performance in cross-city prediction tasks. Additionally, the structured representation clarifies which relational patterns contribute to lower perception scores in urban scenes, such as graffiti on wall and car parked on sidewalk. Overall, this study demonstrates that graph-based structure provides expressive, generalizable, and interpretable signals for modelling urban perception, advancing human-centric and context-aware urban analytics.

### 7. [HippMetric: A skeletal-representation-based framework for cross-sectional and longitudinal hippocampal substructural morphometry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19214v1)

Authors: Na Gao, Chenfei Ye, Yanwu Yang, Anqi Li, Zhengbo He, Li Liang, Zhiyuan Liu, Xingyu Hao, Ting Ma, Tengfei Guo

Accurate characterization of hippocampal substructure is crucial for detecting subtle structural changes and identifying early neurodegenerative biomarkers. However, high inter-subject variability and complex folding pattern of human hippocampus hinder consistent cross-subject and longitudinal analysis. Most existing approaches rely on subject-specific modelling and lack a stable intrinsic coordinate system to accommodate anatomical variability, which limits their ability to establish reliable inter- and intra-individual correspondence. To address this, we propose HippMetric, a skeletal representation (s-rep)-based framework for hippocampal substructural morphometry and point-wise correspondence across individuals and scans. HippMetric builds on the Axis-Referenced Morphometric Model (ARMM) and employs a deformable skeletal coordinate system aligned with hippocampal anatomy and function, providing a biologically grounded reference for correspondence. Our framework comprises two core modules: a skeletal-based coordinate system that respects the hippocampus' conserved longitudinal lamellar architecture, in which functional units (lamellae) are stacked perpendicular to the long-axis, enabling anatomically consistent localization across subjects and time; and individualized s-reps generated through surface reconstruction, deformation, and geometrically constrained spoke refinement, enforcing boundary adherence, orthogonality and non-intersection to produce mathematically valid skeletal geometry. Extensive experiments on two international cohorts demonstrate that HippMetric achieves higher accuracy, reliability, and correspondence stability compared to existing shape models.

Authors: Dazhen Deng, Sen Yang, Yuchen He, Yuan Tian, Yingcai Wu

Current chart-specific tasks, such as chart question answering, chart parsing, and chart generation, are typically studied in isolation, preventing models from learning the shared semantics that link chart generation and interpretation. We introduce CycleChart, a consistency-based learning framework for bidirectional chart understanding and generation. CycleChart adopts a schema-centric formulation as a common interface across tasks. We construct a consistent multi-task dataset, where each chart sample includes aligned annotations for schema prediction, data parsing, and question answering. To learn cross-directional chart semantics, CycleChart introduces a generate-parse consistency objective: the model generates a chart schema from a table and a textual query, then learns to recover the schema and data from the generated chart, enforcing semantic alignment across directions. CycleChart achieves strong results on chart generation, chart parsing, and chart question answering, demonstrating improved cross-task generalization and marking a step toward more general chart understanding models.

Authors: Hengyi Feng, Zeang Sheng, Meiyi Qiang, Wentao Zhang

Despite the remarkable success of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in generative tasks, we observe that they exhibit a counterintuitive deficiency in the zero-shot multimodal retrieval task. In this work, we investigate the underlying mechanisms that hinder MLLMs from serving as effective retrievers. With the help of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), we decompose MLLM output representations into interpretable semantic concepts to probe their intrinsic behavior. Our analysis reveals that the representation space of MLLMs is overwhelmingly dominated by textual semantics; the visual information essential for multimodal retrieval only constitutes a small portion. This imbalance is compounded by the heavy focus of MLLMs on bridging image-text modalities, which facilitates generation but homogenizes embeddings and finally diminishes the discriminative power required for multimodal retrieval. We further discover that the specific feature components that contribute most to the similarity computations for MLLMs are in fact distractors that actively degrade retrieval performance. Overall, our work provides the first in-depth interpretability analysis of MLLM representations in the context of multimodal retrieval and offers possible directions for enhancing the multimodal retrieval capabilities of MLLMs.

Authors: Tao Li, Zhenbao Yu, Banglei Guan, Jianli Han, Weimin Lv, Friedrich Fraundorfer

This work presents two novel solvers for estimating the relative poses among views with known vertical directions. The vertical directions of camera views can be easily obtained using inertial measurement units (IMUs) which have been widely used in autonomous vehicles, mobile phones, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Given the known vertical directions, our lgorithms only need to solve for two rotation angles and two translation vectors. In this paper, a linear closed-form solution has been described, requiring only four point correspondences in three views. We also propose a minimal solution with three point correspondences using the latest Gröbner basis solver. Since the proposed methods require fewer point correspondences, they can be efficiently applied within the RANSAC framework for outliers removal and pose estimation in visual odometry. The proposed method has been tested on both synthetic data and real-world scenes from KITTI. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the estimated poses is superior to other alternative methods.

Authors: Martí Medina-Hern ández, Janos Kertész, Mihály Fazekas

Detecting fraud and corruption in public procurement remains a major challenge for governments worldwide. Most research to-date builds on domain-knowledge-based corruption risk indicators of individual contract-level features and some also analyzes contracting network patterns. A critical barrier for supervised machine learning is the absence of confirmed non-corrupt, negative, examples, which makes conventional machine learning inappropriate for this task. Using publicly available data on federally funded procurement in Mexico and company sanction records, this study implements positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms that integrate domain-knowledge-based red flags with network-derived features to identify likely corrupt and fraudulent contracts. The best-performing PU model on average captures 32 percent more known positives and performs on average 2.3 times better than random guessing, substantially outperforming approaches based solely on traditional red flags. The analysis of the Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that network-derived features, particularly those associated with contracts in the network core or suppliers with high eigenvector centrality, are the most important. Traditional red flags further enhance model performance in line with expectations, albeit mainly for contracts awarded through competitive tenders. This methodology can support law enforcement in Mexico, and it can be adapted to other national contexts too.

Authors: Walter Quattrociocchi, Valerio Capraro, Matjaž Perc

Large language models (LLMs) are widely described as artificial intelligence, yet their epistemic profile diverges sharply from human cognition. Here we show that the apparent alignment between human and machine outputs conceals a deeper structural mismatch in how judgments are produced. Tracing the historical shift from symbolic AI and information filtering systems to large-scale generative transformers, we argue that LLMs are not epistemic agents but stochastic pattern-completion systems, formally describable as walks on high-dimensional graphs of linguistic transitions rather than as systems that form beliefs or models of the world. By systematically mapping human and artificial epistemic pipelines, we identify seven epistemic fault lines, divergences in grounding, parsing, experience, motivation, causal reasoning, metacognition, and value. We call the resulting condition Epistemia: a structural situation in which linguistic plausibility substitutes for epistemic evaluation, producing the feeling of knowing without the labor of judgment. We conclude by outlining consequences for evaluation, governance, and epistemic literacy in societies increasingly organized around generative AI.

Authors: Letizia Iannucci, Elisa Muratore, Antonis Matakos, Mikko Kivelä

In the era of widespread online content consumption, effective detection of coordinated efforts is crucial for mitigating potential threats arising from information manipulation. Despite advances in isolating inauthentic and automated actors, the actions of individual accounts involved in influence campaigns may not stand out as anomalous if analyzed independently of the coordinated group. Given the collaborative nature of information operations, coordinated campaigns are better characterized by evidence of similar temporal behavioral patterns that extend beyond coincidental synchronicity across a group of accounts. We propose a framework to model complex coordination patterns across multiple online modalities. This framework utilizes multiplex networks to first decompose online activities into different interaction layers, and subsequently aggregate evidence of online coordination across the layers. In addition, we propose a time-aware collaboration model to capture patterns of online coordination for each modality. The proposed time-aware model builds upon the node-normalized collaboration model and accounts for repetitions of coordinated actions over different time intervals by employing an exponential decay temporal kernel. We validate our approach on multiple datasets featuring different coordinated activities. Our results demonstrate that a multiplex time-aware model excels in the identification of coordinating groups, outperforming previously proposed methods in coordinated activity detection.

### 4. [Configuration Work: Four Consequences of LLMs-in-use](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19189v1)

Authors: Gabriel Alcaras, Donato Ricci

This article examines what it means to use Large Language Models in everyday work. Drawing on a seven-month longitudinal qualitative study, we argue that LLMs do not straightforwardly automate or augment tasks. We propose the concept of configuration work to describe the labor through which workers make a generic system usable for a specific professional task. Configuration work materializes in four intertwined consequences. First, workers must discretize their activity, breaking it into units that the system can process. Second, operating the system generates cluttering, as prompting, evaluating, and correcting responses add scattered layers of work that get in the way of existing routines. Third, users gradually attune their practices and expectations to the machine's generic rigidity, making sense of the system's limits and finding space for it within their practices. Fourth, as LLMs absorb repetitive tasks, they desaturate the texture of work, shifting activity toward logistical manipulation of outputs and away from forms of engagement that sustain a sense of accomplishment. Taken together, these consequences suggest that LLMs reshape work through the individualized labor required to configure a universal, task-agnostic system within situated professional ecologies.

### 1. [A Computationally Efficient Framework for Overlapping Community Detection in Large Bipartite Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19426v1)

Authors: Yue Zeng, Rong-Hua Li, Qiangqiang Dai, Guoren Wang

Community detection, which uncovers closely connected vertex groups in networks, is vital for applications in social networks, recommendation systems, and beyond. Real-world networks often have bipartite structures (vertices in two disjoint sets with inter-set connections), creating unique challenges on specialized community detection methods. Biclique percolation community (BCPC) is widely used to detect cohesive structures in bipartite graphs. A biclique is a complete bipartite subgraph, and a BCPC forms when maximal bicliques connect via adjacency (sharing an (alpha, beta)-biclique). Yet, existing methods for BCPC detection suffer from high time complexity due to the potentially massive maximal biclique adjacency graph (MBAG). To tackle this, we propose a novel partial-BCPC based solution, whose key idea is to use partial-BCPC to reduce the size of the MBAG. A partial-BCPC is a subset of BCPC. Maximal bicliques belonging to the same partial-BCPC must also belong to the same BCPC. Therefore, these maximal bicliques can be grouped as a single vertex in the MBAG, significantly reducing the size of the MBAG. Furthermore, we move beyond the limitations of MBAG and propose a novel BCPC detection approach based on (alpha, beta)-biclique enumeration. This approach detects BCPC by enumerating all (alpha, beta)-bicliques and connecting maximal bicliques sharing the same (alpha, beta)-biclique, which is the condition for maximal bicliques to be adjacent. It also leverages partial-BCPC to significantly prune the enumeration space of (alpha, beta)-biclique. Experiments show that our methods outperform existing methods by nearly three orders of magnitude.

### 1. [RAPID-LLM: Resilience-Aware Performance analysis of Infrastructure for Distributed LLM Training and Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19606v1)

Authors: George Karfakis, Faraz Tahmasebi, Binglu Chen, Lime Yao, Saptarshi Mitra, Tianyue Pan, Hyoukjun Kwon, Puneet Gupta

RAPID-LLM is a unified performance modeling framework for large language model (LLM) training and inference on GPU clusters. It couples a DeepFlow-based frontend that generates hardware-aware, operator-level Chakra execution traces from an abstract LLM specification (model shape, batch/sequence settings, training vs. inference, and hybrid parallelism choices) with an extended Astra-Sim backend that executes those traces on explicit multi-dimensional network topologies with congestion-aware routing and support for degraded and faulty links. The frontend assigns per-operator latency using a tile-based model that accounts for SM under-utilization and multi-level memory traffic (SRAM/ L2/ HBM), and prunes memory-infeasible configurations using an activation-liveness traversal under recomputation, parallelism and ZeRO/FDSP sharding policies.
  Across A100-based validation cases, RAPID-LLM predicts Llama inference step latency and GPT-scale training time per batch within 10.4\% relative to published measurements, and matches ns-3 packet-level results within 8\% on representative communication workloads. Case studies demonstrate how RAPID-LLM enables fast, exhaustive sweeps over hybrid-parallel configurations, quantifies sensitivity to soft link faults under realistic routing and congestion, and evaluates hypothetical GPU design variants including HBM bandwidth throttling effects.

### 2. [Simulations between Strongly Sublinear MPC and Node-Capacitated Clique](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19326v1)

Authors: Philipp Schneider, Julian Werthmann

We study how the strongly sublinear MPC model relates to the classic, graph-centric distributed models, focusing on the Node-Capacitated Clique (NCC), a bandwidth-parametrized generalization of the Congested Clique. In MPC, $M$ machines with per-machine memory $S$ hold a partition of the input graph, in NCC, each node knows its full neighborhood but can send/receive only a bounded number of $C$ words per round. We are particularly interested in the strongly sublinear regime where $S=C=n^δ$ for some constant $0 < δ<1$.
  Our goal is determine when round-preserving simulations between these models are possible and when they are not, when total memory and total bandwidth $SM=nC$ in both models are matched, for different problem families and graph classes. On the positive side, we provide techniques that allow us to replicate the specific behavior regarding input representation, number of machines and local memory from one model to the other to obtain simulations with only constant overhead. On the negative side, we prove simulation impossibility results, which show that the limitations of our simulations are necessary.

### 3. [Timely Parameter Updating in Over-the-Air Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19103v1)

Authors: Jiaqi Zhu, Zhongyuan Zhao, Xiao Li, Ruihao Du, Shi Jin, Howard H. Yang

Incorporating over-the-air computations (OAC) into the model training process of federated learning (FL) is an effective approach to alleviating the communication bottleneck in FL systems. Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency.

### 4. [Faster Distributed Inference-Only Recommender Systems via Bounded Lag Synchronous Collectives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19342v1)

Authors: Kiril Dichev, Filip Pawlowski, Albert-Jan Yzelman

Recommender systems are enablers of personalized content delivery, and therefore revenue, for many large companies. In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether.

### 5. [Evidential Trust-Aware Model Personalization in Decentralized Federated Learning for Wearable IoT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19131v1)

Authors: Murtaza Rangwala, Richard O. Sinnott, Rajkumar Buyya

Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training across edge devices without centralized coordination, offering resilience against single points of failure. However, statistical heterogeneity arising from non-identically distributed local data creates a fundamental challenge: nodes must learn personalized models adapted to their local distributions while selectively collaborating with compatible peers. Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on three wearable IoT datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA) demonstrates that Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions compared to baseline (0.9% vs. 19.3%), achieves 7.4$\times$ faster convergence, and maintains stable accuracy across hyperparameter choices. These results establish evidential uncertainty as a principled foundation for compatibility-aware personalization in decentralized heterogeneous environments.

### 6. [L4: Low-Latency and Load-Balanced LLM Serving via Length-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19179v1)

Authors: Yitao Yuan, Chenqi Zhao, Bohan Zhao, Zane Cao, Yongchao He, Wenfei Wu

Efficiently harnessing GPU compute is critical to improving user experience and reducing operational costs in large language model (LLM) services. However, current inference engine schedulers overlook the attention backend's sensitivity to request-length heterogeneity within a batch. As state-of-the-art models now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, this once-tolerable inefficiency has escalated into a primary system bottleneck, causing severe performance degradation through GPU underutilization and increased latency. We present L4, a runtime system that dynamically reschedules requests across multiple instances serving the same LLM to mitigate per-instance length heterogeneity. L4 partitions these instances into length-specialized groups, each handling requests within a designated length range, naturally forming a pipeline as requests flow through them. L4 devises a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently find the stage partition with the best QoE, employs runtime range refinement together with decentralized load (re)balance both across and within groups, achieving a balanced and efficient multi-instance service. Our evaluation shows that, under the same configuration, L4 reduces end-to-end latency by up to 67% and tail latency by up to 69%, while improving overall system throughput by up to 2.89 times compared to the state-of-the-art multi-instance scheduling systems.

### 1. [Multimodal LLMs for Historical Dataset Construction from Archival Image Scans: German Patents (1877-1918)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19675v1)

Authors: Niclas Griesshaber, Jochen Streb

We leverage multimodal large language models (LLMs) to construct a dataset of 306,070 German patents (1877-1918) from 9,562 archival image scans using our LLM-based pipeline powered by Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite. Our benchmarking exercise provides tentative evidence that multimodal LLMs can create higher quality datasets than our research assistants, while also being more than 795 times faster and 205 times cheaper in constructing the patent dataset from our image corpus. About 20 to 50 patent entries are embedded on each page, arranged in a double-column format and printed in Gothic and Roman fonts. The font and layout complexity of our primary source material suggests to us that multimodal LLMs are a paradigm shift in how datasets are constructed in economic history. We open-source our benchmarking and patent datasets as well as our LLM-based data pipeline, which can be easily adapted to other image corpora using LLM-assisted coding tools, lowering the barriers for less technical researchers. Finally, we explain the economics of deploying LLMs for historical dataset construction and conclude by speculating on the potential implications for the field of economic history.

### 2. [Research on Novelty Measurement Indicator of Academic Papers Based on the Atypical Recombination of Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18979v1)

Authors: Liang Guoqiang, Sun Jian, Lin Gege, Zhang Shuo

The advancement of science is inherently dependent on the recombination of existing knowledge, and innovative research typically relies on the atypical recombination of established knoweldge bases. This study introduces a Knowledge Eccentricity to enable timely assessment of the novelty of research outputs by quantifying their degree of deviation from the existing knowledge system. For empirical analysis, we selected sample data including research articles published in Science and Nature, top 1% highly cited papers, and zero-cited papers for the year 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2025. We calculated the knowledge eccentricity scores for these papers and examined their potential influencing factors. The results indicate that team size exerts a significant negative effect on paper novelty, meaning larger team size is less conductive to enhancing the novelty of research outputs. Conversely, the number of references shows a signifcant positive correlation with paper novelty, which means that a greater number of references is associated with a moderate imporovement in a paper's novelty. The proposed indicator offers strong timeliness and operability, allowing for the evaluation of a paper's novelty immediately upon its publication.

### 1. [Deep Learning for Unrelated-Machines Scheduling: Handling Variable Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19527v1)

Authors: Diego Hitzges, Guillaume Sagnol

Deep learning has been effectively applied to many discrete optimization problems. However, learning-based scheduling on unrelated parallel machines remains particularly difficult to design. Not only do the numbers of jobs and machines vary, but each job-machine pair has a unique processing time, dynamically altering feature dimensions. We propose a novel approach with a neural network tailored for offline deterministic scheduling of arbitrary sizes on unrelated machines. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function that includes the makespan and the weighted tardiness of jobs and machines. Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average. As our method allows fast retraining with simulated data and adaptation to various scheduling conditions, we believe it has the potential to become a standard approach for learning-based scheduling on unrelated machines and similar problem environments.

Authors: Claude Carlet, and Alexander Kholosha

Much work has been devoted to bent functions in odd characteristic, but a gap remains between our knowledge of binary and nonbinary bent functions. In the first part of this paper, we attempt to partially bridge this gap by generalizing to any characteristic important properties known in characteristic 2 concerning the Walsh transform of derivatives of bent functions. Some of these properties generalize to all bent functions, while others appear to apply only to weakly regular bent functions. We deduce a method to obtain a bent function by adding a quadratic function to a weakly regular bent function. We also identify a particular class of bent functions possessing the property that every first-order derivative in a nonzero direction has a derivative (which is then a second-order derivative of the function) equal to a nonzero constant. We show that this property implies bentness and is shared in particular by all cubic bent functions. It generalizes the notion of cubic-like bent function, that was introduced and studied for binary functions by Irene Villa and the first author.
  In the second part of the paper, we provide (for the first time) a primary construction leading to an infinite class of cubic bent functions that are not weakly regular. We show the bentness of the functions by two approaches: by calculating the Walsh transform directly and by considering the second-order derivatives (and applying the results from the first part of the paper).

### 3. [Laplacian Network Optimization via Information Functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19279v1)

Authors: Samuel Rosa, Radoslav Harman

Designing networks to optimize robustness and other performance metrics is a well-established problem with applications ranging from electrical engineering to communication networks. Many such performance measures rely on the Laplacian spectrum; notable examples include total effective resistance, the number of spanning trees, and algebraic connectivity. This paper advances the study of Laplacian-based network optimization by drawing on ideas from experimental design in statistics. We present a theoretical framework for analyzing performance measures by introducing the notion of information functions, which captures a set of their desirable properties. Then, we formulate a new parametric family of information functions, Kiefer's measures, which encompasses the three most common spectral objectives. We provide a regular reformulation of the Laplacian optimization problem, and we use this reformulation to compute directional derivatives of Kiefer's measures. The directional derivatives provide a unified treatment of quantities recurring in Laplacian optimization, such as gradients and subgradients, and we show that they are connected to Laplacian-based measures of node distance, which we call node dissimilarities. We apply the node dissimilarities to derive efficient rank-one update formulas for Kiefer's criteria, and to devise a new edge-exchange method for network optimization. These update formulas enable greedy and exchange algorithms with reduced asymptotic time complexity.

Authors: Diptarka Chakraborty, Hendrik Fichtenberger, Bernhard Haeupler, Silvio Lattanzi, Ashkan Norouzi-Fard, Ola Svensson

Designing efficient, effective, and consistent metric clustering algorithms is a significant challenge attracting growing attention. Traditional approaches focus on the stability of cluster centers; unfortunately, this neglects the real-world need for stable point labels, i.e., stable assignments of points to named sets (clusters). In this paper, we address this gap by initiating the study of label-consistent metric clustering. We first introduce a new notion of consistency, measuring the label distance between two consecutive solutions. Then, armed with this new definition, we design new consistent approximation algorithms for the classical $k$-center and $k$-median problems.

Authors: Martin Hoefer, Lennart Kauther, Philipp Pabst, Britta Peis, Khai Van Tran

Tariff setting in public transportation networks is an important challenge. A popular approach is to partition the network into fare zones ("zoning") and fix journey prices depending on the number of traversed zones ("pricing"). In this paper, we focus on finding revenue-optimal solutions to the zoning problem for a given concave pricing function. We consider tree networks with $n$ vertices, since trees already pose non-trivial algorithmic challenges. Our main results are efficient algorithms that yield a simple $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-approximation as well as a more involved $\mathcal{O}(\log n/\log \log n)$-approximation. We show how to solve the problem exactly on rooted instances, in which all demand arises at the same source. For paths, we prove strong NP-hardness and outline a PTAS. Moreover, we show that computing an optimal solution is in FPT or XP for several natural problem parameters.

### 3. [On Factoring and Power Divisor Problems via Rank-3 Lattices and the Second Vector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19076v1)

Authors: Yiming Gao, Yansong Feng, Honggang Hu, Yanbin Pan

We propose a deterministic algorithm based on Coppersmith's method that employs a rank-3 lattice to address factoring-related problems. An interesting aspect of our approach is that we utilize the second vector in the LLL-reduced basis to avoid trivial collisions in the Baby-step Giant-step method, rather than the shortest vector as is commonly used in the literature. Our results are as follows:
  1. Compared to the result by Harvey and Hittmeir (Math. Comp. 91 (2022), 1367 - 1379), who achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/5) log^(16/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5)) for factoring a semiprime N = pq, we demonstrate that in the balanced p and q case, the complexity can be improved to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5) ).
  2. For factoring sums and differences of powers, that is, numbers of the form N = a^n plus or minus b^n, we improve Hittmeir's result (Math. Comp. 86 (2017), 2947 - 2954) from O( N^(1/4) log^(3/2) N ) to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N ).
  3. For the problem of finding r-power divisors, that is, finding all integers p such that p^r divides N, Harvey and Hittmeir (Proceedings of ANTS XV, Research in Number Theory 8 (2022), no. 4, Paper No. 94) recently directly applied Coppersmith's method and achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(10+epsilon) N / r^3 ). By using faster LLL-type algorithms and sieving on small primes, we improve their result to O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(7+3 epsilon) N / ((log log N minus log(4r)) r^(2+epsilon)) ). The worst-case running time for their algorithm occurs when N = p^r q with q on the order of N^(1/2). By focusing on this case and employing our rank-3 lattice approach, we achieve a complexity of O( r^(1/4) N^(1/(4r)) log^(5/2) N ).
  In conclusion, we offer a new perspective on these problems, which we hope will provide further insights.

### 4. [Near-optimal streaming approximation for Max-DICUT in sublinear space using two passes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19521v1)

Authors: Santhoshini Velusamy

The Max-DICUT problem has gained a lot of attention in the streaming setting in recent years, and has so far served as a canonical problem for designing algorithms for general constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) in this setting. A seminal result of Kapralov and Krachun [STOC 2019] shows that it is impossible to beat $1/2$-approximation for Max-DICUT in sublinear space in the single-pass streaming setting, even on bounded-degree graphs. In a recent work, Saxena, Singer, Sudan, and Velusamy [SODA 2025] prove that the above lower bound is tight by giving a single-pass algorithm for bounded-degree graphs that achieves $(1/2-ε)$-approximation in sublinear space, for every constant $ε>0$. For arbitrary graphs of unbounded degree, they give an $O(1/ε)$-pass $O(\log n)$ space algorithm. Their work left open the question of obtaining $1/2$-approximation for arbitrary graphs in the single-pass setting in sublinear space. We make progress towards this question and give a two-pass algorithm that achieves $(1/2-ε)$-approximation in sublinear space, for every constant $ε>0$.

Authors: Guan-Cheng Chen, Chieh-Lin Tsai, Pei-Hsuan Tsai, Yuan-Hao Chang

Compute-In-Memory (CIM) systems, particularly those utilizing ReRAM and memristive technologies, offer a promising path toward energy-efficient neural network computation. However, conventional quantization and compression techniques often fail to fully optimize performance and efficiency in these architectures. In this work, we present a structured quantization method that combines sensitivity analysis with mixed-precision strategies to enhance weight storage and computational performance on ReRAM-based CIM systems. Our approach improves ReRAM Crossbar utilization, significantly reducing power consumption, latency, and computational load, while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results show 86.33% accuracy at 70% compression, alongside a 40% reduction in power consumption, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for power-constrained applications.

Authors: Maria Mannone, Paulo Vitor Itaborai, Omar Costa Hamido, Miriam Goldack, Norbert Marwan, Peppino Fazio, Patrizia Ribino

We apply sonification strategies and quantum computing to the analysis of an episode of seizure. We first sonify the signal from a selection of channels (from real ECoG data), obtaining a polyphonic sequence. Then, we propose two quantum approaches to simulate a similar episode of seizure, and we sonify the results. The comparison of sonifications can give hints on similarities and discrepancies between real data and simulations, helping refine the \textit{in silico} model. This is a pioneering approach, showing how the combination of quantum computing and sonification can broaden the perspective of real-data investigation, and helping define a new test bench for analysis and prediction of seizures.

Authors: Moses Ganardi, Markus Lohrey

It is shown that the problem of computing the Strahler number of a binary tree given as a term is complete for the circuit complexity class uniform $\mathsf{NC}^1$. For several variants, where the binary tree is given by a pointer structure or in a succinct form by a directed acyclic graph or a tree straight-line program, the complexity of computing the Strahler number is determined as well. The problem, whether a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form produces a derivation tree (resp., an acyclic derivation tree), whose Strahler number is at least a given number $k$ is shown to be P-complete (resp., PSPACE-complete).

Authors: Yujie Zhao, Hongwei Fan, Di Chen, Shengcong Chen, Liliang Chen, Xiaoqi Li, Guanghui Ren, Hao Dong

Recent progress in robot learning has been driven by large-scale datasets and powerful visuomotor policy architectures, yet policy robustness remains limited by the substantial cost of collecting diverse demonstrations, particularly for spatial generalization in manipulation tasks. To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.

Authors: Yinhuai Wang, Runyi Yu, Hok Wai Tsui, Xiaoyi Lin, Hui Zhang, Qihan Zhao, Ke Fan, Miao Li, Jie Song, Jingbo Wang, Qifeng Chen, Ping Tan

We present a system for learning generalizable hand-object tracking controllers purely from synthetic data, without requiring any human demonstrations. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) HOP, a Hand-Object Planner, which can synthesize diverse hand-object trajectories; and (2) HOT, a Hand-Object Tracker that bridges synthetic-to-physical transfer through reinforcement learning and interaction imitation learning, delivering a generalizable controller conditioned on target hand-object states. Our method extends to diverse object shapes and hand morphologies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our approach enables dexterous hands to track challenging, long-horizon sequences including object re-arrangement and agile in-hand reorientation. These results represent a significant step toward scalable foundation controllers for manipulation that can learn entirely from synthetic data, breaking the data bottleneck that has long constrained progress in dexterous manipulation.

Authors: Raina Panda, Daniel Fein, Arpita Singhal, Mark Fiore, Maneesh Agrawala, Matyas Bohacek

Artistic style transfer in generative models remains a significant challenge, as existing methods often introduce style only via model fine-tuning, additional adapters, or prompt engineering, all of which can be computationally expensive and may still entangle style with subject matter. In this paper, we introduce a training- and inference-light, interpretable method for representing and transferring artistic style. Our approach leverages an art-specific Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on top of latent embeddings of generative image models. Trained on artistic data, our SAE learns an emergent, largely disentangled set of stylistic and compositional concepts, corresponding to style-related elements pertaining brushwork, texture, and color palette, as well as semantic and structural concepts. We call it LouvreSAE and use it to construct style profiles: compact, decomposable steering vectors that enable style transfer without any model updates or optimization. Unlike prior concept-based style transfer methods, our method requires no fine-tuning, no LoRA training, and no additional inference passes, enabling direct steering of artistic styles from only a few reference images. We validate our method on ArtBench10, achieving or surpassing existing methods on style evaluations (VGG Style Loss and CLIP Score Style) while being 1.7-20x faster and, critically, interpretable.

Authors: Hongwei Fan, Hang Dai, Jiyao Zhang, Jinzhou Li, Qiyang Yan, Yujie Zhao, Mingju Gao, Jinghang Wu, Hao Tang, Hao Dong

The robotics field is evolving towards data-driven, end-to-end learning, inspired by multimodal large models. However, reliance on expensive real-world data limits progress. Simulators offer cost-effective alternatives, but the gap between simulation and reality challenges effective policy transfer. This paper introduces TwinAligner, a novel Real2Sim2Real system that addresses both visual and dynamic gaps. The visual alignment module achieves pixel-level alignment through SDF reconstruction and editable 3DGS rendering, while the dynamic alignment module ensures dynamic consistency by identifying rigid physics from robot-object interaction. TwinAligner improves robot learning by providing scalable data collection and establishing a trustworthy iterative cycle, accelerating algorithm development. Quantitative evaluations highlight TwinAligner's strong capabilities in visual and dynamic real-to-sim alignment.

Authors: Jussi Keppo, Yingkai Li

This paper studies optimal contract design in private market investing, focusing on internal decision making in venture capital and private equity firms. A principal relies on an agent who privately exerts costly due diligence effort and then recommends whether to invest. Outcomes are observable ex post even when an opportunity is declined, allowing compensation to reward both successful investments and prudent decisions to pass. We characterize profit maximizing contracts that induce information acquisition and truthful reporting. We show that three tier contracts are sufficient, with payments contingent on the agent's recommendation and the realized return. In symmetric environments satisfying the monotone likelihood ratio property, the optimal contract further simplifies to a threshold contract that pays only when the recommendation is aligned with an extreme realized return. These results provide guidance for performance based compensation that promotes diligent screening while limiting excessive risk taking.

### 2. [LOCO: A Low-Cost SNU-Self-Resilient Latch Using an Output-Split C-Element](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19292v1)

Authors: Ruijun Ma, Xin Chen, Xiaoqing Wen, Hui Xu, Shengnan Ye, Chuanjian Zhang, Senling Wang

As the CMOS technology enters nanometer scales, integrated circuits (ICs) become increasingly sensitive to radiation-induced soft errors, which can corrupt the state of storage elements and cause severe reliability issues. Many hardened designs have been proposed to mitigate soft errors by using filtering elements. However, existing filtering elements only protect their inputs against soft errors and leave their outputs unprotected. Therefore, additional filtering elements must be added to protect outputs, resulting in extra overhead. In this paper, we first propose a novel Output-Split C-element (OSC) to protect both its input and output nodes, and then a novel LOw-COst single-node-upset (SNU) self-resilient latch (LOCO) to use OSCs to achieve both soft error resilience and low overhead. The usage of OSCs effectively reduce the short-circuit current of the LOCO latch during switching activities. Furthermore, the usage of clock gating and high-speed path reduces power consumption and delay, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art SNU-resilient hardened designs, the LOCO latch achieves 19% fewer transistors, 63.58% lower power, 74% less delay, and 92% lower power-delay-product (PDP) on average. In addition, the LOCO latch exhibits better stability under variations in PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature).

Authors: Martin Hoefer, Lennart Kauther, Philipp Pabst, Britta Peis, Khai Van Tran

Tariff setting in public transportation networks is an important challenge. A popular approach is to partition the network into fare zones ("zoning") and fix journey prices depending on the number of traversed zones ("pricing"). In this paper, we focus on finding revenue-optimal solutions to the zoning problem for a given concave pricing function. We consider tree networks with $n$ vertices, since trees already pose non-trivial algorithmic challenges. Our main results are efficient algorithms that yield a simple $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-approximation as well as a more involved $\mathcal{O}(\log n/\log \log n)$-approximation. We show how to solve the problem exactly on rooted instances, in which all demand arises at the same source. For paths, we prove strong NP-hardness and outline a PTAS. Moreover, we show that computing an optimal solution is in FPT or XP for several natural problem parameters.

### 4. [Stochastic assignment games for Mobility-as-a-Service markets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19328v1)

Authors: Bingqing Liu, David Watling, Joseph Y. J. Chow

We study the stochastic assignment game and extend it to model multimodal mobility markets with a regulator or a Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform. We start by presenting general forms of one-to-one and many-to-many stochastic assignment games. Optimality conditions are discussed. The core of stochastic assignment games is defined, with expected payoffs of sellers and buyers in stochastic assignment games as payoffs from a hypothetical "ideal matching" that represent sellers' and buyers' expectations under imperfect information. To apply stochastic assignment games to the urban mobility markets, we extend the general stochastic many-to-many assignment game into a stochastic Stackelberg game to model MaaS systems, where the platform is the leader, and users and operators are the followers. The platform sets fares to maximize revenue. Users and operator react to the fare settings to form a stochastic many-to-many assignment game considering both fixed-route services and Mobility-on-Demand (MOD). The Stackelberg game is formulated as a bilevel problem. The lower level is the stochastic many-to-many assignment game between users and operators, shown to yield a coalitional logit model. The upper-level problem is a fare adjustment problem maximizing revenue. An iterative balancing algorithm is proposed to solve the lower-level problem exactly. The bilevel problem is solved through an iterative fare adjusting heuristic, whose solution is shown to be equivalent to the bilevel problem with an additional condition when it converges. Two case studies are conducted. The model can be applied to design MaaS fares maximizing income of the platform while anticipating the selfish behavior and heterogeneity of users and operators. Public agencies can also use the model to manage multimodal transportation systems.

### 5. [Considering the Difference in Utility Functions of Team Players in Adversarial Team Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18989v1)

Authors: Youzhi Zhang

The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires that all countries collaborate to fight adversarial factors to achieve peace and prosperity for humans and the planet. This scenario can be formulated as an adversarial team game in AI literature, where a team of players play against an adversary. However, previous solution concepts for this game assume that team players have the same utility functions, which cannot cover the real-world case that countries do not always have the same utility function. This paper argues that studying adversarial team games should not ignore the difference in utility functions of team players. We show that ignoring the difference in utility functions of team players could cause the computed equilibrium to be unstable. To show the benefit of considering the difference in utility functions of team players, we introduce a novel solution concept called Co-opetition Equilibrium (CoE) for the adversarial team game. In this game, team players with different utility functions (i.e., cooperation between team players) correlate their actions to play against the adversary (i.e., competition between the team and the adversary). We further introduce the team-maximizing CoE, which is a CoE but maximizes the team's utility among all CoEs. Both equilibria can overcome the issue caused by ignoring the difference in utility functions of team players. We further show the opportunities for theoretical and algorithmic contributions based on our position of considering the difference in utility functions of team players.

### 6. [Fair Team Contracts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19388v1)

Authors: Matteo Castiglioni, Junjie Chen, Yingkai Li

A principal selects a team of agents for collaborating on a joint project. The principal aims to design a revenue-optimal contract that incentivize the team of agents to exert costly effort while satisfying fairness constraints. We show that the optimal fair contract ensures that there is a minimum share, and every agent receives a linear contract weakly higher than the minimum share that is sufficient to incentivize them to exert costly effort. We utilize this structure to design an FPTAS for additive success functions and a constant approximation algorithm for submodular success functions. Moreover, we show that adopting optimal fair contracts can lead to a 25% revenue increase compared to the optimal non-discriminatory contracts even for additive success functions.

### 7. [A Unified Framework and Comparative Study of Decentralized Finance Derivatives Protocols](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19113v1)

Authors: Luca Pennella, Pietro Saggese, Fabio Pinelli, Letterio Galletta

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications introduce novel financial instruments replicating and extending traditional ones through blockchain-based smart contracts. Among these, derivatives protocols enable the decentralized trading of cryptoassets that are the counterpart of derivative products available in traditional finance. Despite their growing significance, DeFi derivatives protocols remain relatively understudied compared to other DeFi instruments, such as lending protocols and decentralized exchanges with automated market makers. This paper systematically analyzes DeFi derivatives protocols - categorized into perpetual, options, and synthetics - in the field, highlighting similarities, differences, dynamics, and actors. As a result of our study, we provide a formal characterization of decentralized derivative products and introduce a unifying conceptual framework that captures the design principles and core architecture of such protocols. We complement our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations: we evaluate protocol dynamics under various economic conditions, including changes in underlying asset prices, volatility, protocol-specific fees, leverage, and their impact on liquidation and profitability.

### Human-Computer Interaction

### 1. [The Epistemological Consequences of Large Language Models: Rethinking collective intelligence and institutional knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19570v1)

Authors: Angjelin Hila

We examine epistemological threats posed by human and LLM interaction. We develop collective epistemology as a theory of epistemic warrant distributed across human collectives, using bounded rationality and dual process theory as background. We distinguish internalist justification, defined as reflective understanding of why a proposition is true, from externalist justification, defined as reliable transmission of truths. Both are necessary for collective rationality, but only internalist justification produces reflective knowledge. We specify reflective knowledge as follows: agents understand the evaluative basis of a claim, when that basis is unavailable agents consistently assess the reliability of truth sources, and agents have a duty to apply these standards within their domains of competence. We argue that LLMs approximate externalist reliabilism because they can reliably transmit information whose justificatory basis is established elsewhere, but they do not themselves possess reflective justification. Widespread outsourcing of reflective work to reliable LLM outputs can weaken reflective standards of justification, disincentivize comprehension, and reduce agents' capacity to meet professional and civic epistemic duties. To mitigate these risks, we propose a three tier norm program that includes an epistemic interaction model for individual use, institutional and organizational frameworks that seed and enforce norms for epistemically optimal outcomes, and deontic constraints at organizational and or legislative levels that instantiate discursive norms and curb epistemic vices.

### 2. [Epistemological Fault Lines Between Human and Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19466v1)

Authors: Walter Quattrociocchi, Valerio Capraro, Matjaž Perc

Large language models (LLMs) are widely described as artificial intelligence, yet their epistemic profile diverges sharply from human cognition. Here we show that the apparent alignment between human and machine outputs conceals a deeper structural mismatch in how judgments are produced. Tracing the historical shift from symbolic AI and information filtering systems to large-scale generative transformers, we argue that LLMs are not epistemic agents but stochastic pattern-completion systems, formally describable as walks on high-dimensional graphs of linguistic transitions rather than as systems that form beliefs or models of the world. By systematically mapping human and artificial epistemic pipelines, we identify seven epistemic fault lines, divergences in grounding, parsing, experience, motivation, causal reasoning, metacognition, and value. We call the resulting condition Epistemia: a structural situation in which linguistic plausibility substitutes for epistemic evaluation, producing the feeling of knowing without the labor of judgment. We conclude by outlining consequences for evaluation, governance, and epistemic literacy in societies increasingly organized around generative AI.

### 3. [More code, less validation: Risk factors for over-reliance on AI coding tools among scientists](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19644v1)

Authors: Gabrielle O'Brien, Alexis Parker, Nasir Eisty, Jeffrey Carver

Programming is essential to modern scientific research, yet most scientists report inadequate training for the software development their work demands. Generative AI tools capable of code generation may support scientific programmers, but user studies indicate risks of over-reliance, particularly among inexperienced users. We surveyed 868 scientists who program, examining adoption patterns, tool preferences, and factors associated with perceived productivity. Adoption is highest among students and less experienced programmers, with variation across fields. Scientific programmers overwhelmingly prefer general-purpose conversational interfaces like ChatGPT over developer-specific tools. Both inexperience and limited use of development practices (like testing, code review, and version control) are associated with greater perceived productivity-but these factors interact, suggesting formal practices may partially compensate for inexperience. The strongest predictor of perceived productivity is the number of lines of generated code typically accepted at once. These findings suggest scientific programmers using generative AI may gauge productivity by code generation rather than validation, raising concerns about research code integrity.

### 4. [Towards a collaborative digital platform for railway infrastructure projects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19169v1)

Authors: Pierre Jehel, Pierre-Étienne Gautier, Judicaël Dehotin, Flavien Viguier

The management of railway infrastructure projects can be supported by collaborative digital platforms. A survey was carried out to identify the needs and expectations of the various stakeholders involved in the design and construction of railway infrastructure projects regarding collaborative platforms. These needs and expectations can then be translated into functional specifications to be included in the digital platforms. A total of 21 interviews were conducted between October and December 2022, during which 35 individuals were interviewed. Key roles were represented across the different project phases: engineers from design and construction firms, project managers, infrastructure managers. And various engineering fields were represented: civil, electrical, telecommunications, tracks, systems. These interviews were carried out by CentraleSup{é}lec | Universit{é} Paris-Saclay and by SNCF R{é}seau using a structured protocol designed to collect the specific needs of the interviewees for collaboration, as well as the guiding principles that shape both individual work practices and collaboration between professions. The resulting material was analyzed and then synthesized into a conceptual model of a collaborative digital platform for supporting the design and construction phases in a railway infrastructure project. Also, from these interviews emerged five core functionalities that the platform must offer: Providing access to existing infrastructure data; Accelerating repetitive tasks; Verifying essential project requirements; Supporting decision-making; Facilitating coordination among stakeholders.

Authors: Md Minhazul Islam Munna, Al Amin, Xin Wang, Hongbin Ma

Augmented Reality (AR) technology holds immense potential to transform the lives of blind and disabled individuals by offering enhanced interaction with their surroundings and providing real-time, accessible information. Globally, AR applications are being developed with features such as audio descriptions of environments, object recognition, and navigational aids, specifically designed to support the visually impaired. These innovations are paving the way for increased independence, mobility, and overall quality of life for millions of people worldwide. In Bangladesh, the adoption of AR technology for the blind and disabled is still in its early stages, primarily due to limited accessibility resources and infrastructure challenges. However, with the growing penetration of smartphones and continuous advancements in AR technologies, there is a promising opportunity for these solutions to be adapted, localized, and scaled within the country. This paper reviews the current state of AR technologies for the visually impaired on a global scale, explores their potential application in Bangladesh, and delves into the challenges and opportunities for broader implementation in this context.

### Information Retrieval

### 1. [Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS): Front-end Code via Structure Normalization and Constrained Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18996v1)

Authors: Chong Liu, Ming Zhang, Fei Li, Hao Zhou, Xiaoshuang Chen, Ye Yuan

Automated front-end engineering drastically reduces development cycles and minimizes manual coding overhead. While Generative AI has shown promise in translating designs to code, current solutions often produce monolithic scripts, failing to natively support modern ecosystems like React, Vue, or Angular. Furthermore, the generated code frequently suffers from poor modularity, making it difficult to maintain. To bridge this gap, we introduce Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS), a hierarchical framework that merges visual understanding with structural normalization. Initially, a visual-semantic encoder maps the screen capture into a serialized tree topology, capturing the essential layout hierarchy. Instead of simple parsing, we apply heuristic deduplication and pattern recognition to isolate reusable blocks, creating a framework-agnostic schema. Finally, a constraint-based generation protocol guides the LLM to synthesize production-ready code with strict typing and component props. Evaluations show that MLS significantly outperforms existing baselines, ensuring superior code reusability and structural integrity across multiple frameworks

### 2. [QuCo-RAG: Quantifying Uncertainty from the Pre-training Corpus for Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19134v1)

Authors: Dehai Min, Kailin Zhang, Tongtong Wu, Lu Cheng

Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation adaptively determines when to retrieve during generation to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods rely on model-internal signals (e.g., logits, entropy), which are fundamentally unreliable because LLMs are typically ill-calibrated and often exhibit high confidence in erroneous outputs. We propose QuCo-RAG, which shifts from subjective confidence to objective statistics computed from pre-training data. Our method quantifies uncertainty through two stages: (1) before generation, we identify low-frequency entities indicating long-tail knowledge gaps; (2) during generation, we verify entity co-occurrence in the pre-training corpus, where zero co-occurrence often signals hallucination risk. Both stages leverage Infini-gram for millisecond-latency queries over 4 trillion tokens, triggering retrieval when uncertainty is high. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show QuCo-RAG achieves EM gains of 5--12 points over state-of-the-art baselines with OLMo-2 models, and transfers effectively to models with undisclosed pre-training data (Llama, Qwen, GPT), improving EM by up to 14 points. Domain generalization on biomedical QA further validates the robustness of our paradigm. These results establish corpus-grounded verification as a principled, practically model-agnostic paradigm for dynamic RAG. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhishanQ/QuCo-RAG.

Authors: Markus Ekvall, Ludvig Bergenstråhle, Patrick Truong, Ben Murrell, Joakim Lundeberg

Retrieval-augmented generation improves large language models by grounding outputs in external knowledge sources, reducing hallucinations and addressing knowledge cutoffs. However, standard embedding-based retrieval fails to capture the complexity of multi-concept queries, particularly in domains like biomedicine, where biological data are inherently high-dimensional. For example,omics datasets, and clinical reports simultaneously exhibit numerous molecular, cellular, and physiological features. We present Stochastic Latent Matching (STHLM), a generative vector search method that samples query-conditioned embeddings from text or image inputs to enhance retrieval performance. Analogous to how Chain-of-Thought reasoning enables language models to "think longer" on complex problems, STHLM allows retrieval systems to "search wider" through iterative sampling. STHLM demonstrates critical improvements over classical vector retrieval across diverse benchmarks, including scientific literature, clinical notes, and tissue images, boosting retrieval performance by 10-30% through test-time compute (trading latency for accuracy), while enabling up to a 10-fold compression of embedding dimensions.

### Machine Learning

### 1. [Interpretable Hybrid Deep Q-Learning Framework for IoT-Based Food Spoilage Prediction with Synthetic Data Generation and Hardware Validation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19361v1)

Authors: Isshaan Singh, Divyansh Chawla, Anshu Garg, Shivin Mangal, Pallavi Gupta, Khushi Agarwal, Nimrat Singh Khalsa, Nandan Patel

The need for an intelligent, real-time spoilage prediction system has become critical in modern IoT-driven food supply chains, where perishable goods are highly susceptible to environmental conditions. Existing methods often lack adaptability to dynamic conditions and fail to optimize decision making in real time. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for enhanced spoilage prediction. This hybrid architecture captures temporal dependencies within sensor data, enabling robust and adaptive decision making. In alignment with interpretable artificial intelligence principles, a rule-based classifier environment is employed to provide transparent ground truth labeling of spoilage levels based on domain-specific thresholds. This structured design allows the agent to operate within clearly defined semantic boundaries, supporting traceable and interpretable decisions. Model behavior is monitored using interpretability-driven metrics, including spoilage accuracy, reward-to-step ratio, loss reduction rate, and exploration decay. These metrics provide both quantitative performance evaluation and insights into learning dynamics. A class-wise spoilage distribution visualization is used to analyze the agents decision profile and policy behavior. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-time hardware data demonstrate that the LSTM and RNN based agent outperforms alternative reinforcement learning approaches in prediction accuracy and decision efficiency while maintaining interpretability. The results highlight the potential of hybrid deep reinforcement learning with integrated interpretability for scalable IoT-based food monitoring systems.

### 2. [Time-Vertex Machine Learning for Optimal Sensor Placement in Temporal Graph Signals: Applications in Structural Health Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19309v1)

Authors: Keivan Faghih Niresi, Jun Qing, Mengjie Zhao, Olga Fink

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and resilience of infrastructure. As sensor networks grow in scale and complexity, identifying the most informative sensors becomes essential to reduce deployment costs without compromising monitoring quality. While Graph Signal Processing (GSP) has shown promise by leveraging spatial correlations among sensor nodes, conventional approaches often overlook the temporal dynamics of structural behavior. To overcome this limitation, we propose Time-Vertex Machine Learning (TVML), a novel framework that integrates GSP, time-domain analysis, and machine learning to enable interpretable and efficient sensor placement by identifying representative nodes that minimize redundancy while preserving critical information. We evaluate the proposed approach on two bridge datasets for damage detection and time-varying graph signal reconstruction tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing SHM systems by providing a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for sensor placement.

### 3. [GShield: Mitigating Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19286v1)

Authors: Sameera K. M., Serena Nicolazzo, Antonino Nocera, Vinod P., Rafidha Rehiman K. A

Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a revolutionary approach to collaborative training Machine Learning models. In particular, it enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy, but its distributed nature makes it highly vulnerable to a severe attack known as Data Poisoning. In such scenarios, malicious clients inject manipulated data into the training process, thereby degrading global model performance or causing targeted misclassification. In this paper, we present a novel defense mechanism called GShield, designed to detect and mitigate malicious and low-quality updates, especially under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data scenarios. GShield operates by learning the distribution of benign gradients through clustering and Gaussian modeling during an initial round, enabling it to establish a reliable baseline of trusted client behavior. With this benign profile, GShield selectively aggregates only those updates that align with the expected gradient patterns, effectively isolating adversarial clients and preserving the integrity of the global model. An extensive experimental campaign demonstrates that our proposed defense significantly improves model robustness compared to the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a high accuracy of performance across both tabular and image datasets. Furthermore, GShield improves the accuracy of the targeted class by 43\% to 65\% after detecting malicious and low-quality clients.

### 4. [Phase-space entropy at acquisition reflects downstream learnability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19223v1)

Authors: Xiu-Cheng Wang, Jun-Jie Zhanga, Nan Cheng, Long-Gang Pang, Taijiao Du, Deyu Meng

Modern learning systems work with data that vary widely across domains, but they all ultimately depend on how much structure is already present in the measurements before any model is trained. This raises a basic question: is there a general, modality-agnostic way to quantify how acquisition itself preserves or destroys the information that downstream learners could use? Here we propose an acquisition-level scalar $ΔS_{\mathcal B}$ based on instrument-resolved phase space. Unlike pixelwise distortion or purely spectral errors that often saturate under aggressive undersampling, $ΔS_{\mathcal B}$ directly quantifies how acquisition mixes or removes joint space--frequency structure at the instrument scale. We show theoretically that \(ΔS_{\mathcal B}\) correctly identifies the phase-space coherence of periodic sampling as the physical source of aliasing, recovering classical sampling-theorem consequences. Empirically, across masked image classification, accelerated MRI, and massive MIMO (including over-the-air measurements), $|ΔS_{\mathcal B}|$ consistently ranks sampling geometries and predicts downstream reconstruction/recognition difficulty \emph{without training}. In particular, minimizing $|ΔS_{\mathcal B}|$ enables zero-training selection of variable-density MRI mask parameters that matches designs tuned by conventional pre-reconstruction criteria. These results suggest that phase-space entropy at acquisition reflects downstream learnability, enabling pre-training selection of candidate sampling policies and as a shared notion of information preservation across modalities.

### 5. [On the Koopman-Based Generalization Bounds for Multi-Task Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19199v1)

Authors: Mahdi Mohammadigohari, Giuseppe Di Fatta, Giuseppe Nicosia, Panos M. Pardalos

The paper establishes generalization bounds for multitask deep neural networks using operator-theoretic techniques. The authors propose a tighter bound than those derived from conventional norm based methods by leveraging small condition numbers in the weight matrices and introducing a tailored Sobolev space as an expanded hypothesis space. This enhanced bound remains valid even in single output settings, outperforming existing Koopman based bounds. The resulting framework maintains key advantages such as flexibility and independence from network width, offering a more precise theoretical understanding of multitask deep learning in the context of kernel methods.

### 6. [Operator-Based Generalization Bound for Deep Learning: Insights on Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19184v1)

Authors: Mahdi Mohammadigohari, Giuseppe Di Fatta, Giuseppe Nicosia, Panos M. Pardalos

This paper presents novel generalization bounds for vector-valued neural networks and deep kernel methods, focusing on multi-task learning through an operator-theoretic framework. Our key development lies in strategically combining a Koopman based approach with existing techniques, achieving tighter generalization guarantees compared to traditional norm-based bounds. To mitigate computational challenges associated with Koopman-based methods, we introduce sketching techniques applicable to vector valued neural networks. These techniques yield excess risk bounds under generic Lipschitz losses, providing performance guarantees for applications including robust and multiple quantile regression. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning framework, deep vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vvRKHS), leveraging Perron Frobenius (PF) operators to enhance deep kernel methods. We derive a new Rademacher generalization bound for this framework, explicitly addressing underfitting and overfitting through kernel refinement strategies. This work offers novel insights into the generalization properties of multitask learning with deep learning architectures, an area that has been relatively unexplored until recent developments.

### 7. [Fraud Detection Through Large-Scale Graph Clustering with Heterogeneous Link Transformation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19061v1)

Authors: Chi Liu

Collaborative fraud, where multiple fraudulent accounts coordinate to exploit online payment systems, poses significant challenges due to the formation of complex network structures. Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters. Our framework provides a scalable and practical solution for industrial-scale fraud detection systems.

Authors: Liping Sun, Yucheng Guo, Siliang Lu, Zhenzhen Li

With the press of global climate change, extreme weather and sudden weather changes are becoming increasingly common. To maintain a comfortable indoor environment and minimize the contribution of the building to climate change as much as possible, higher requirements are placed on the operation and control of HVAC systems, e.g., more energy-efficient and flexible to response to the rapid change of weather. This places demands on the rapid modeling and prediction of zone air temperatures of buildings. Compared to the traditional simulation-based approach such as EnergyPlus and DOE2, a hybrid approach combined physics and data-driven is more suitable. Recently, the availability of high-quality datasets and algorithmic breakthroughs have driven a considerable amount of work in this field. However, in the niche of short- and long-term predictions, there are still some gaps in existing research. This paper aims to develop a time series forecast model to predict the zone air temperature in a building located in America on a 2-week horizon. The findings could be further improved to support intelligent control and operation of HVAC systems (i.e. demand flexibility) and could also be used as hybrid building energy modeling.

Authors: Md Minhazul Islam Munna, Md Mahbubur Rahman, Jaroslav Frnda, Muhammad Shahid Anwar, Alpamis Kutlimuratov

The proliferation of IoT devices and their reliance on Wi-Fi networks have introduced significant security vulnerabilities, particularly the KRACK and Kr00k attacks, which exploit weaknesses in WPA2 encryption to intercept and manipulate sensitive data. Traditional IDS using classifiers face challenges such as model overfitting, incomplete feature extraction, and high false positive rates, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a robust multiclass machine learning based intrusion detection framework. The methodology integrates advanced feature selection techniques to identify critical attributes, mitigating redundancy and enhancing detection accuracy. Two distinct ML architectures are implemented: a baseline classifier pipeline and a stacked ensemble model combining noise injection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and meta learning to improve generalization and reduce false positives. Evaluated on the AWID3 data set, the proposed ensemble architecture achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 98%, precision of 98%, recall of 98%, and a false positive rate of just 2%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. This work demonstrates the efficacy of combining preprocessing strategies with ensemble learning to fortify network security against sophisticated Wi-Fi attacks, offering a scalable and reliable solution for IoT environments. Future directions include real-time deployment and adversarial resilience testing to further enhance the model's adaptability.

Authors: Ariana Azarbal, Victor Gillioz, Vladimir Ivanov, Bryce Woodworth, Jacob Drori, Nevan Wichers, Aram Ebtekar, Alex Cloud, Alexander Matt Turner

Developers often struggle to specify correct training labels and rewards. Perhaps they don't need to. We propose recontextualization, which reduces how often language models "game" training signals, performing misbehaviors those signals mistakenly reinforce. We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it. This mitigates the reinforcement of misbehavior from misspecified training signals, reducing specification gaming without improving the supervision signal.

### Neural and Evolutionary Computing

### 1. [Clustering-based Transfer Learning for Dynamic Multimodal MultiObjective Evolutionary Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18947v1)

Authors: Li Yan, Bolun Liu, Chao Li, Jing Liang, Kunjie Yu, Caitong Yue, Xuzhao Chai, Boyang Qu

Dynamic multimodal multiobjective optimization presents the dual challenge of simultaneously tracking multiple equivalent pareto optimal sets and maintaining population diversity in time-varying environments. However, existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms often neglect solution modality, whereas static multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms lack adaptability to dynamic changes. To address above challenge, this paper makes two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer. Empirical analysis on 12 instances of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions reveals that, compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, our algorithm not only preserves population diversity more effectively in the decision space but also achieves superior convergence in the objective space.

Urban underground cable construction is essential for enhancing the reliability of city power grids, yet its high construction costs make planning a worthwhile optimization task. In urban environments, road layouts tightly constrain cable routing. This, on the one hand, renders relation-only models (i.e., those without explicit routes) used in prior work overly simplistic, and on the other hand, dramatically enlarges the combinatorial search space, thereby imposing much higher demands on algorithm design. In this study, we formulate urban cable routing as a connectivity-path co-optimization problem and propose a learning-assisted multi-operator variable neighborhood search (L-MVNS) algorithm. The framework first introduces an auxiliary task to generate high-quality feasible initial solutions. A hybrid genetic search (HGS) and A* serve as the connectivity optimizer and the route-planning optimizer, respectively. Building on these, a multi-operator variable neighborhood search (MVNS) iteratively co-optimizes inter-substation connectivity and detailed routes via three complementary destruction operators, a modified A* repair operator, and an adaptive neighborhood-sizing mechanism. A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning module is further embedded to prioritize promising neighborhoods. We also construct a standardized and scalable benchmark suite for evaluation. Across these cases, comprehensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and stability: relative to representative approaches, MVNS and L-MVNS reduce total construction cost by approximately 30-50%, with L-MVNS delivering additional gains on larger instances and consistently higher stability.

Authors: Jiawei Hou, Peng Yang, Xiangxiang Dai, Mingliu Liu, Conghao Zhou

Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) is critical to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) as it can provide unified and precise representation of vehicular surroundings. However, quality of the raw sensing data may degrade in occluded or distant regions, undermining the fidelity of constructed BEV map. In this paper, we propose BEVCooper, a novel collaborative perception framework that can guarantee accurate and low-latency BEV map construction. We first define an effective metric to evaluate the utility of BEV features from neighboring CAVs. Then, based on this, we develop an online learning-based collaborative CAV selection strategy that captures the ever-changing BEV feature utility of neighboring vehicles, enabling the ego CAV to prioritize the most valuable sources under bandwidth-constrained vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. Furthermore, we design an adaptive fusion mechanism that optimizes BEV feature compression based on the environment dynamics and real-time V2V channel quality, effectively balancing feature transmission latency and accuracy of the constructed BEV map. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, BEVCooper achieves asymptotically optimal CAV selection and adaptive feature fusion under dynamic vehicular topology and V2V channel conditions. Extensive experiments on real-world testbed show that, compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed BEVCooper enhances BEV perception accuracy by up to $63.18\%$ and reduces end-to-end latency by $67.9\%$, with only $1.8\%$ additional computational overhead.

### 2. [Semantic Communication for Rate-Limited Closed-Loop Distributed Communication-Sensing-Control Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19177v1)

Authors: Guangjin Pan, Zhixing Li, Ayça Özçelikkale, Christian Häger, Musa Furkan Keskin, Henk Wymeersch

The growing integration of distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with closed-loop control in intelligent networks demands efficient information transmission under stringent bandwidth constraints. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a unified framework for goal-oriented semantic communication in distributed SCC systems. Building upon Weaver's three-level model, we establish a hierarchical semantic formulation with three error levels (L1: observation reconstruction, L2: state estimation, and L3: control) to jointly optimize their corresponding objectives. Based on this formulation, we propose a unified goal-oriented semantic compression and rate adaptation framework that is applicable to different semantic error levels and optimization goals across the SCC loop. A rate-limited multi-sensor LQR system is used as a case study to validate the proposed framework. We employ a GRU-based AE for semantic compression and a PPO-based rate adaptation algorithm that dynamically allocates transmission rates across sensors. Results show that the proposed framework effectively captures task-relevant semantics and adapts its resource allocation strategies across different semantic levels, thereby achieving level-specific performance gains under bandwidth constraints.

Authors: Zhenguo Gao, Hui Li, Yiqin Chen, Qingyu Gao, Zhufang Kuang, Shih-Hau Fang, Hsiao-Chun Wu

The high mobility and flexible deployment capability of UAVs make them an impressive option for charging nodes in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) using Directional Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. However, existing studies largely focus on 2D-WRSNs, lacking designs catering to real 3D-WRSNs. The spatial distribution characteristics of nodes in a 3D-WRSN further increase the complexity of the charging scheduling task, thus requiring a systematic framework to solve this problem. In this paper, we investigated the Directional UAV Charging Scheduling problem for 3D-WRSNs (DCS-3D) and established its NP-hard property, and then proposed a three-step framework named as directional charging scheduling algorithm using Functional Equivalent (FuncEqv) direction set and Lin-Kernighan heuristic (LKH) for 3D-WRSNs (FELKH-3D) to solve it. In FELKH-3D, the challenge of infinite charging direction space is solved by designing an algorithm generating a minimum-size direction set guaranteed to be FuncEqv to the infinite set of whole sphere surface, and the optimaility of the method was proved.To determine the optimal charging tour for the UAV, the LKH algorithm is employed.Simulation experiments demonstrated the superiority of FELKH-3D over other classical algorithms.

Authors: Murdadha Nasif, Ahmed Refaey Hussein

Semantic communication and edge-cloud collaborative intelligence are increasingly recognized as foundational enablers for next-generation intelligent services operating under stringent bandwidth, latency, and resource constraints. By shifting the communication objective from bit-perfect delivery toward the transmission of task-relevant semantic representations, semantic communication enables adaptive tradeoffs among communication overhead, inference accuracy, computational load, and end-to-end latency. This survey provides a comprehensive and system-level synthesis of recent advances in semantic communication at the edge-cloud interface, encompassing architectural models for collaborative intelligence, representation learning and semantic abstraction techniques, network-aware and resource-adaptive semantic encoding strategies, and learning-driven optimization and orchestration mechanisms. Beyond efficiency considerations, the survey situates semantic communication within practical operational contexts, including security, trust, resilience, and scalability, drawing connections to zero-trust networking, physical-layer security, and emerging edge-cloud control paradigms. Finally, open challenges and research directions are identified, highlighting the role of semantic communication as a key building block for AI-native networking and 6G-ready intelligent systems.

### 5. [CORE: Compensable Reward as a Catalyst for Improving Offline RL in Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19671v1)

Authors: Lipeng Zu, Hansong Zhou, Yu Qian, Shayok Chakraborty, Yukun Yuan, Linke Guo, Xiaonan Zhang

Real-world wireless data are expensive to collect and often lack sufficient expert demonstrations, causing existing offline RL methods to overfit suboptimal behaviors and exhibit unstable performance. To address this issue, we propose CORE, an offline RL framework specifically designed for wireless environments. CORE identifies latent expert trajectories from noisy datasets via behavior embedding clustering, and trains a conditional variational autoencoder with a contrastive objective to separate expert and non-expert behaviors in latent space. Based on the learned representations, CORE constructs compensable rewards that reflect expert-likelihood, effectively guiding policy learning under limited or imperfect supervision. More broadly, this work represents one of the early systematic explorations of offline RL in wireless networking, where prior adoption remains limited. Beyond introducing offline RL techniques to this domain, we further examine intrinsic wireless data characteristics and develop a domain-aligned algorithm that explicitly accounts for their structural properties. While offline RL has not yet been fully established as a standard methodology in the wireless community, our study aims to provide foundational insights and empirical evidence to support its broader acceptance.

### 6. [Lightweight Intrusion Detection in IoT via SHAP-Guided Feature Pruning and Knowledge-Distilled Kronecker Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19488v1)

Authors: Hafsa Benaddi, Mohammed Jouhari, Nouha Laamech, Anas Motii, Khalil Ibrahimi

The widespread deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices requires intrusion detection systems (IDS) with high accuracy while operating under strict resource constraints. Conventional deep learning IDS are often too large and computationally intensive for edge deployment. We propose a lightweight IDS that combines SHAP-guided feature pruning with knowledge-distilled Kronecker networks. A high-capacity teacher model identifies the most relevant features through SHAP explanations, and a compressed student leverages Kronecker-structured layers to minimize parameters while preserving discriminative inputs. Knowledge distillation transfers softened decision boundaries from teacher to student, improving generalization under compression. Experiments on the TON\_IoT dataset show that the student is nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the teacher yet sustains macro-F1 above 0.986 with millisecond-level inference latency. The results demonstrate that explainability-driven pruning and structured compression can jointly enable scalable, low-latency, and energy-efficient IDS for heterogeneous IoT environments.

### 1. [Real2Edit2Real: Generating Robotic Demonstrations via a 3D Control Interface](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19402v1)

Authors: Yujie Zhao, Hongwei Fan, Di Chen, Shengcong Chen, Liliang Chen, Xiaoqi Li, Guanghui Ren, Hao Dong

Recent progress in robot learning has been driven by large-scale datasets and powerful visuomotor policy architectures, yet policy robustness remains limited by the substantial cost of collecting diverse demonstrations, particularly for spatial generalization in manipulation tasks. To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.

### 2. [OMP: One-step Meanflow Policy with Directional Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19347v1)

Authors: Han Fang, Yize Huang, Yuheng Zhao, Paul Weng, Xiao Li, Yutong Ban

Robot manipulation, a key capability of embodied AI, has turned to data-driven generative policy frameworks, but mainstream approaches like Diffusion Models suffer from high inference latency and Flow-based Methods from increased architectural complexity. While simply applying meanFlow on robotic tasks achieves single-step inference and outperforms FlowPolicy, it lacks few-shot generalization due to fixed temperature hyperparameters in its Dispersive Loss and misaligned predicted-true mean velocities. To solve these issues, this study proposes an improved MeanFlow-based Policies: we introduce a lightweight Cosine Loss to align velocity directions and use the Differential Derivation Equation (DDE) to optimize the Jacobian-Vector Product (JVP) operator. Experiments on Adroit and Meta-World tasks show the proposed method outperforms MP1 and FlowPolicy in average success rate, especially in challenging Meta-World tasks, effectively enhancing few-shot generalization and trajectory accuracy of robot manipulation policies while maintaining real-time performance, offering a more robust solution for high-precision robotic manipulation.

### 3. [Vision-Aided Relative State Estimation for Approach and Landing on a Moving Platform with Inertial Measurements](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19245v1)

Authors: Tarek Bouazza, Alessandro Melis, Soulaimane Berkane, Robert Mahony, Tarek Hamel

This paper tackles the problem of estimating the relative position, orientation, and velocity between a UAV and a planar platform undergoing arbitrary 3D motion during approach and landing. The estimation relies on measurements from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) mounted on both systems, assuming there is a suitable communication channel to exchange data, together with visual information provided by an onboard monocular camera, from which the bearing (line-of-sight direction) to the platform's center and the normal vector of its planar surface are extracted. We propose a cascade observer with a complementary filter on SO(3) to reconstruct the relative attitude, followed by a linear Riccati observer for relative position and velocity estimation. Convergence of both observers is established under persistently exciting conditions, and the cascade is shown to be almost globally asymptotically and locally exponentially stable. We further extend the design to the case where the platform's rotation is restricted to its normal axis and show that its measured linear acceleration can be exploited to recover the remaining unobservable rotation angle. A sufficient condition to ensure local exponential convergence in this setting is provided. The performance of the proposed observers is validated through extensive simulations.

### 4. [Learning Generalizable Hand-Object Tracking from Synthetic Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19583v1)

Authors: Yinhuai Wang, Runyi Yu, Hok Wai Tsui, Xiaoyi Lin, Hui Zhang, Qihan Zhao, Ke Fan, Miao Li, Jie Song, Jingbo Wang, Qifeng Chen, Ping Tan

We present a system for learning generalizable hand-object tracking controllers purely from synthetic data, without requiring any human demonstrations. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) HOP, a Hand-Object Planner, which can synthesize diverse hand-object trajectories; and (2) HOT, a Hand-Object Tracker that bridges synthetic-to-physical transfer through reinforcement learning and interaction imitation learning, delivering a generalizable controller conditioned on target hand-object states. Our method extends to diverse object shapes and hand morphologies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our approach enables dexterous hands to track challenging, long-horizon sequences including object re-arrangement and agile in-hand reorientation. These results represent a significant step toward scalable foundation controllers for manipulation that can learn entirely from synthetic data, breaking the data bottleneck that has long constrained progress in dexterous manipulation.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models empower robots to understand and execute tasks described by natural language instructions. However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the π_{0}, π_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

### 6. [LIMOncello: Revisited IKFoM on the SGal(3) Manifold for Fast LiDAR-Inertial Odometry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19567v1)

Authors: Carlos Pérez-Ruiz, Joan Solà

This work introduces LIMOncello, a tightly coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry system that models 6-DoF motion on the $\mathrm{SGal}(3)$ manifold within an iterated error-state Kalman filter backend. Compared to state representations defined on $\mathrm{SO}(3)\times\mathbb{R}^6$, the use of $\mathrm{SGal}(3)$ provides a coherent and numerically stable discrete-time propagation model that helps limit drift in low-observability conditions.
  LIMOncello also includes a lightweight incremental i-Octree mapping backend that enables faster updates and substantially lower memory usage than incremental kd-tree style map structures, without relying on locality-restricted search heuristics. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that LIMOncello achieves competitive accuracy while improving robustness in geometrically sparse environments. The system maintains real-time performance with stable memory growth and is released as an extensible open-source implementation at https://github.com/CPerezRuiz335/LIMOncello.

Authors: Dixuan Lin, Tianyou Wang, Zhuoyang Pan, Yufu Wang, Lingjie Liu, Kostas Daniilidis

We build the first system to address the problem of reconstructing in-scene object manipulation from a monocular RGB video. It is challenging due to ill-posed scene reconstruction, ambiguous hand-object depth, and the need for physically plausible interactions. Existing methods operate in hand centric coordinates and ignore the scene, hindering metric accuracy and practical use. In our method, we first use data-driven foundation models to initialize the core components, including the object mesh and poses, the scene point cloud, and the hand poses. We then apply a two-stage optimization that recovers a complete hand-object motion from grasping to interaction, which remains consistent with the scene information observed in the input video.

### 8. [Translating Flow to Policy via Hindsight Online Imitation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19269v1)

Authors: Yitian Zheng, Zhangchen Ye, Weijun Dong, Shengjie Wang, Yuyang Liu, Chongjie Zhang, Chuan Wen, Yang Gao

Recent advances in hierarchical robot systems leverage a high-level planner to propose task plans and a low-level policy to generate robot actions. This design allows training the planner on action-free or even non-robot data sources (e.g., videos), providing transferable high-level guidance. Nevertheless, grounding these high-level plans into executable actions remains challenging, especially with the limited availability of high-quality robot data. To this end, we propose to improve the low-level policy through online interactions. Specifically, our approach collects online rollouts, retrospectively annotates the corresponding high-level goals from achieved outcomes, and aggregates these hindsight-relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. Our method, Hindsight Flow-conditioned Online Imitation (HinFlow), instantiates this idea with 2D point flows as the high-level planner. Across diverse manipulation tasks in both simulation and physical world, our method achieves more than $2\times$ performance improvement over the base policy, significantly outperforming the existing methods. Moreover, our framework enables policy acquisition from planners trained on cross-embodiment video data, demonstrating its potential for scalable and transferable robot learning.

### 9. [CoDrone: Autonomous Drone Navigation Assisted by Edge and Cloud Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19083v1)

Authors: Pengyu Chen, Tao Ouyang, Ke Luo, Weijie Hong, Xu Chen

Autonomous navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles faces key challenges from limited onboard computational resources, which restrict deployed deep neural networks to shallow architectures incapable of handling complex environments. Offloading tasks to remote edge servers introduces high latency, creating an inherent trade-off in system design. To address these limitations, we propose CoDrone - the first cloud-edge-end collaborative computing framework integrating foundation models into autonomous UAV cruising scenarios - effectively leveraging foundation models to enhance performance of resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicle platforms. To reduce onboard computation and data transmission overhead, CoDrone employs grayscale imagery for the navigation model. When enhanced environmental perception is required, CoDrone leverages the edge-assisted foundation model Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and introduces a novel one-dimensional occupancy grid-based navigation method - enabling fine-grained scene understanding while advancing efficiency and representational simplicity of autonomous navigation. A key component of CoDrone is a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based neural scheduler that seamlessly integrates depth estimation with autonomous navigation decisions, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the framework introduces a UAV-specific vision language interaction module incorporating domain-tailored low-level flight primitives to enable effective interaction between the cloud foundation model and the UAV. The introduction of VLM enhances open-set reasoning capabilities in complex unseen scenarios. Experimental results show CoDrone outperforms baseline methods under varying flight speeds and network conditions, achieving a 40% increase in average flight distance and a 5% improvement in average Quality of Navigation.

### 10. [IndoorUAV: Benchmarking Vision-Language UAV Navigation in Continuous Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19024v1)

Authors: Xu Liu, Yu Liu, Hanshuo Qiu, Yang Qirong, Zhouhui Lian

Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables agents to navigate in complex environments by following natural language instructions grounded in visual observations. Although most existing work has focused on ground-based robots or outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), indoor UAV-based VLN remains underexplored, despite its relevance to real-world applications such as inspection, delivery, and search-and-rescue in confined spaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV}, a novel benchmark and method specifically tailored for VLN with indoor UAVs. We begin by curating over 1,000 diverse and structurally rich 3D indoor scenes from the Habitat simulator. Within these environments, we simulate realistic UAV flight dynamics to collect diverse 3D navigation trajectories manually, further enriched through data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we design an automated annotation pipeline to generate natural language instructions of varying granularity for each trajectory. This process yields over 16,000 high-quality trajectories, comprising the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLN} subset, which focuses on long-horizon VLN. To support short-horizon planning, we segment long trajectories into sub-trajectories by selecting semantically salient keyframes and regenerating concise instructions, forming the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLA} subset. Finally, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV-Agent}, a novel navigation model designed for our benchmark, leveraging task decomposition and multimodal reasoning. We hope IndoorUAV serves as a valuable resource to advance research on vision-language embodied AI in the indoor aerial navigation domain.

### 1. [Semantically-Equivalent Transformations-Based Backdoor Attacks against Neural Code Models: Characterization and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19215v1)

Authors: Junyao Ye, Zhen Li, Xi Tang, Shouhuai Xu, Deqing Zou, Zhongsheng Yuan

Neural code models have been increasingly incorporated into software development processes. However, their susceptibility to backdoor attacks presents a significant security risk. The state-of-the-art understanding focuses on injection-based attacks, which insert anomalous patterns into software code. These attacks can be neutralized by standard sanitization techniques. This status quo may lead to a false sense of security regarding backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new kind of backdoor attacks, dubbed Semantically-Equivalent Transformation (SET)-based backdoor attacks, which use semantics-preserving low-prevalence code transformations to generate stealthy triggers. We propose a framework to guide the generation of such triggers. Our experiments across five tasks, six languages, and models like CodeBERT, CodeT5, and StarCoder show that SET-based attacks achieve high success rates (often >90%) while preserving model utility. The attack proves highly stealthy, evading state-of-the-art defenses with detection rates on average over 25.13% lower than injection-based counterparts. We evaluate normalization-based countermeasures and find they offer only partial mitigation, confirming the attack's robustness. These results motivate further investigation into scalable defenses tailored to SET-based attacks.

Authors: Xiaolan Cai, Mathieu O'Neil, Stefano Zacchiroli

This article explores the role of unrecognised labour in corporate innovation systems via an analysis of researcher coding and discursive contributions to R, one of the largest statistical software ecosystems. Studies of online platforms typically focus on how platform affordances constrain participants' actions, and profit from their labour. We innovate by connecting the labour performed inside digital platforms to the professional employment of participants. Our case study analyses 8,924 R package repositories on GitHub, examining commits and communications. Our quantitative findings show that researchers, alongside non-affiliated contributors, are the most frequent owners of R package repositories and their most active contributors. Researchers are more likely to hold official roles compared to the average, and to engage in collaborative problem-solving and support work during package development. This means there is, underneath the 'recognised' category of star researchers who transition between academia and industry and secure generous funding, an 'unrecognised' category of researchers who not only create and maintain key statistical infrastructure, but also provide support to industry employees, for no remuneration. Our qualitative findings show how this unrecognised labour affects practitioners. Finally, our analysis of the ideology and practice of free, libre and open source software (FLOSS) shows how this ideology and practice legitimate the use of 'university rents' by Big Tech.

### 3. [Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS): Front-end Code via Structure Normalization and Constrained Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18996v1)

Authors: Chong Liu, Ming Zhang, Fei Li, Hao Zhou, Xiaoshuang Chen, Ye Yuan

Automated front-end engineering drastically reduces development cycles and minimizes manual coding overhead. While Generative AI has shown promise in translating designs to code, current solutions often produce monolithic scripts, failing to natively support modern ecosystems like React, Vue, or Angular. Furthermore, the generated code frequently suffers from poor modularity, making it difficult to maintain. To bridge this gap, we introduce Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS), a hierarchical framework that merges visual understanding with structural normalization. Initially, a visual-semantic encoder maps the screen capture into a serialized tree topology, capturing the essential layout hierarchy. Instead of simple parsing, we apply heuristic deduplication and pattern recognition to isolate reusable blocks, creating a framework-agnostic schema. Finally, a constraint-based generation protocol guides the LLM to synthesize production-ready code with strict typing and component props. Evaluations show that MLS significantly outperforms existing baselines, ensuring superior code reusability and structural integrity across multiple frameworks

### 4. [Beyond Language Boundaries: Uncovering Programming Language Families for Code Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19509v1)

Authors: Shangbo Yun, Xiaodong Gu, Jianghong Huang, Beijun Shen

The rapid proliferation of diverse programming languages presents both opportunities and challenges for developing multilingual code LLMs. While existing techniques often train code LLMs by simply aggregating multilingual code data, few explore the deeper relationships between programming languages(PLs) and how such relationships can be utilized to optimize the training and inference of code LLMs. In this work, we investigate 2 fundamental questions: 1) What are the deep linguistic relationships among PLs? and 2) How can these relationships be leveraged to improve multilingual code LLMs? We propose an embedding-based framework to uncover the latent families of PLs. Our approach begins by defining 21 primary linguistic features of programming languages, such as variable definition, control structures, and method declarations, and then employs LLMs to generate feature-aligned code samples across multiple languages. By embedding these semantically parallel code snippets from 19 languages, we construct a similarity matrix and perform hierarchical clustering to uncover inherent language relationships. Our analysis reveals clear hierarchical structures among programming languages. Closely related languages form well-defined clusters (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Swift group together), while Go exhibits as a central language with the highest cross-language similarity. Building on the uncovered language families, we propose three strategies to enhance multilingual LLM training: transfer learning across linguistically related languages, linguistic proximity-guided curriculum learning, and centroid-based intermediary code translation. Experiments on 4 code intelligence tasks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve multilingual LLM performance. This work offers a universal perspective on programming languages and advances more effective strategies for multilingual code LLM training.

### 5. [More code, less validation: Risk factors for over-reliance on AI coding tools among scientists](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19644v1)

Authors: Gabrielle O'Brien, Alexis Parker, Nasir Eisty, Jeffrey Carver

Programming is essential to modern scientific research, yet most scientists report inadequate training for the software development their work demands. Generative AI tools capable of code generation may support scientific programmers, but user studies indicate risks of over-reliance, particularly among inexperienced users. We surveyed 868 scientists who program, examining adoption patterns, tool preferences, and factors associated with perceived productivity. Adoption is highest among students and less experienced programmers, with variation across fields. Scientific programmers overwhelmingly prefer general-purpose conversational interfaces like ChatGPT over developer-specific tools. Both inexperience and limited use of development practices (like testing, code review, and version control) are associated with greater perceived productivity-but these factors interact, suggesting formal practices may partially compensate for inexperience. The strongest predictor of perceived productivity is the number of lines of generated code typically accepted at once. These findings suggest scientific programmers using generative AI may gauge productivity by code generation rather than validation, raising concerns about research code integrity.

Authors: Yuwon Yoon, Kevin Iwan, Madeleine Zwart, Xiaohan Qin, Hina Lee, Maria Spichkova

Planning for an upcoming project iteration (sprint) is one of the key activities in Scrum planning. In this paper, we present our work in progress on exploring the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving this problem. We conducted case studies with manually created data sets to investigate the applicability of OpenAI models for supporting the sprint planning activities. In our experiments, we applied three models provided OpenAI: GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.0 Turbo, and Val. The experiments demonstrated that the results produced by the models aren't of acceptable quality for direct use in Scrum projects.

### 7. [A Dataset and Preliminary Study of Using GPT-5 for Code-change Impact Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19481v1)

Authors: Katharina Stengg, Christian Macho, Martin Pinzger

Understanding source code changes and their impact on other code entities is a crucial skill in software development. However, the analysis of code changes and their impact is often performed manually and therefore is time-consuming. Recent advancements in AI, and in particular large language models (LLMs) show promises to help developers in various code analysis tasks. However, the extent to which this potential can be utilized for understanding code changes and their impact is underexplored. To address this gap, we study the capabilities of GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini to predict the code entities impacted by given source code changes. We construct a dataset containing information about seed-changes, change pairs, and change types for each commit. Existing datasets lack crucial information about seed changes and impacted code entities. Our experiments evaluate the LLMs in two configurations: (1) seed-change information and the parent commit tree and (2) seed-change information, the parent commit tree, and the diff hunk of each seed change. We found that both LLMs perform poorly in the two experiments, whereas GPT-5 outperforms GPT-5-mini. Furthermore, the provision of the diff hunks helps both models to slightly improve their performance.

### 8. [BanglaForge: LLM Collaboration with Self-Refinement for Bangla Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19122v1)

Authors: Mahir Labib Dihan, Sadif Ahmed, Md Nafiu Rahman

Bangla is a low-resource language for code generation, lacking large-scale annotated datasets and tools to transform natural language specifications into executable programs. This makes Bangla-to-code generation a challenging task requiring innovative solutions. To address this, we introduce BanglaForge, a novel framework for generating code from Bangla function descriptions. BanglaForge leverages a retrieval-augmented dual-model collaboration paradigm with self-refinement, combining in-context learning, llm-based translation, systematic prompt engineering, and iterative self-refinement based on execution feedback, where a coder generates initial solutions and a reviewer enhances them for robustness. On the BLP-2025 Bangla Code Generation benchmark, BanglaForge achieves a competitive Pass@1 accuracy of 84.00%, demonstrating the effectiveness of retrieval, model collaboration, and self-refinement for low-resource Bangla code generation.

### 9. [FASTRIC: Prompt Specification Language for Verifiable LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18940v1)

Authors: Wen-Long Jin

Large Language Models (LLMs) execute complex multi-turn interaction protocols but lack formal specifications to verify execution against designer intent. We introduce FASTRIC, a Prompt Specification Language that makes implicit Finite State Machines (FSMs) explicit in natural language prompts, enabling conformance verification through execution trace analysis. The LLM serves as intelligent execution agent: interpreting designer-encoded FSMs to execute specified behavioral roles. Unlike symbolic specification languages requiring parsers and compilers, FASTRIC leverages LLMs as unified infrastructure-simultaneously parser, interpreter, runtime environment, and development assistant. FASTRIC guides designers to articulate seven FSM elements (Final States, Agents, States, Triggers, Roles, Initial State, Constraints) structuring multi-turn interactions. Specification formality-ranging from implicit descriptions that frontier models infer to explicit step-by-step instructions for weaker models-serves as a design parameter. We introduce procedural conformance as verification metric measuring execution adherence to FSM specifications. Testing a 3-state kindergarten tutoring FSM across four formality levels and three model scales (14.7B, 685B, 1T+ parameters) reveals optimal specification formality is a function of model capacity. DeepSeek-V3.2 (685B) achieves perfect conformance (1.00) at L2-L4; ChatGPT-5 (~1T) peaks at L3 (0.90) before collapsing at L4 (0.39); Phi4 (14.7B) shows no stable optimum with high variance (SD=0.16-0.36). These findings reveal model-specific formality ranges-"Goldilocks zones"-where specifications provide sufficient structure without over-constraint, establishing Prompt Specification Engineering for creating verifiable interaction protocols, transforming multi-turn interaction design from heuristic art to systematic engineering with measurable procedural guarantees.

Authors: Muhammad Usman Tariq, Abhinav Jangda, Angelica Moreira, Madan Musuvathi, Tyler Sorensen

Advancements in large language models (LLMs) are showing promising impact in software development and programming assistance. However, these models struggle when operating on low-level backend code. This challenge is exacerbated in the domain of GPU kernels, where performance-critical details are coupled to rapidly evolving hardware characteristics and available code examples are sparse.
  In this work, we introduce PEAK, a Performance Engineering AI-Assistant for GPU Kernels powered by natural language transformations. PEAK utilizes the key insight that iterative code transformations (optimizations) can straightforwardly be written in natural language, and then carried out by LLMs. Thus, these transformations can be rapidly developed, encoding general portable optimizations, but also easily specialized to specific GPU devices and even kernels. These natural transformations are supported by a modular and extensible infrastructure that additionally performs validation and performance evaluation. We demonstrate the flexibility of PEAK by instantiating it for three backends, CUDA, HIP, and HLSL, and create 16 natural transformations for optimizing matrix multiplication kernels. We show that our resulting implementations are competitive with vendor libraries when available, and for HLSL (without a library) our implementations match the hardware documented FLOPS. PEAK allows the fine-grained exploration of several research questions around how LLMs behave in this domain, including characterizing transformations and their errors; and how performance evolves along optimization sequences. PEAK provides an interface that can either be utilized by performance engineers to improve productivity, or driven completely autonomously (e.g., by an AI agent), providing a forward-compatible design that can continue to improve with advances in AI capabilities.

Authors: Chaoyang Luo, Yuji Zhang, Minyu Feng, Attila Szolnoki

Individual cooperative strategy influences the surrounding dynamic population, which in turn affects cooperative strategy. To better model this phenomenon, we develop a Markov decision chain based game transitions model and examine the dynamic transitions in game states of individuals within a network and their impact on the strategy's evolution. Additionally, we extend single-round strategy imitation to multiple rounds to better capture players' potential non-rational behavior. Using intensive simulations, we explore the effects of transition probabilities and game parameters on game transitions and cooperation. Our study finds that strategy-driven game transitions promote cooperation, and increasing the transition rates of Markov decision chains can significantly accelerate this process. By designing different Markov decision chains, these results provide simulation based guidance for practical applications in swarm intelligence, such as strategic collaboration.

### 2. [A Computationally Efficient Framework for Overlapping Community Detection in Large Bipartite Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19426v1)

Authors: Yue Zeng, Rong-Hua Li, Qiangqiang Dai, Guoren Wang

Community detection, which uncovers closely connected vertex groups in networks, is vital for applications in social networks, recommendation systems, and beyond. Real-world networks often have bipartite structures (vertices in two disjoint sets with inter-set connections), creating unique challenges on specialized community detection methods. Biclique percolation community (BCPC) is widely used to detect cohesive structures in bipartite graphs. A biclique is a complete bipartite subgraph, and a BCPC forms when maximal bicliques connect via adjacency (sharing an (alpha, beta)-biclique). Yet, existing methods for BCPC detection suffer from high time complexity due to the potentially massive maximal biclique adjacency graph (MBAG). To tackle this, we propose a novel partial-BCPC based solution, whose key idea is to use partial-BCPC to reduce the size of the MBAG. A partial-BCPC is a subset of BCPC. Maximal bicliques belonging to the same partial-BCPC must also belong to the same BCPC. Therefore, these maximal bicliques can be grouped as a single vertex in the MBAG, significantly reducing the size of the MBAG. Furthermore, we move beyond the limitations of MBAG and propose a novel BCPC detection approach based on (alpha, beta)-biclique enumeration. This approach detects BCPC by enumerating all (alpha, beta)-bicliques and connecting maximal bicliques sharing the same (alpha, beta)-biclique, which is the condition for maximal bicliques to be adjacent. It also leverages partial-BCPC to significantly prune the enumeration space of (alpha, beta)-biclique. Experiments show that our methods outperform existing methods by nearly three orders of magnitude.

### 3. [A Reverse Reachable Set Based Approach for Motif Oriented Profit maximization in Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19237v1)

Authors: Poonam Sharma, Suman Banerjee

Profit Maximization is one of the key objectives for social media marketing, where the task is to choose a limited number of highly influential nodes such that their initial activation leads to maximum profit. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the Profit Maximization Problem where we consider that instead of nodes, benefits are assigned to some of the motifs of the graph, and these benefit values can be earned once a given threshold count of nodes from the motifs is influenced. The goal here is to choose a limited number of nodes for initial activation called seed nodes such that the motif-oriented profit gets maximized. Formally, we call our problem the Motif Oriented Profit Maximization Problem. We show that the problem is NP-hard to solve optimally. We propose a Reverse Reachable Set-based framework to solve our problem. The proposed methodology broadly divides into three steps: KPT Estimation and RR Set generation, Seed Set Selection, and Motif Oriented Profit Estimation. The proposed methodology has been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements. It has been implemented with real-world social network datasets, and the results are reported. We observe that the seed set selected by the proposed solution approaches leads to more profit compared to the seed sets selected by the existing methods. The whole implementation and data are available at: https://github.com/PoonamSharma-PY/MotifProfit.

Authors: Letizia Iannucci, Elisa Muratore, Antonis Matakos, Mikko Kivelä

In the era of widespread online content consumption, effective detection of coordinated efforts is crucial for mitigating potential threats arising from information manipulation. Despite advances in isolating inauthentic and automated actors, the actions of individual accounts involved in influence campaigns may not stand out as anomalous if analyzed independently of the coordinated group. Given the collaborative nature of information operations, coordinated campaigns are better characterized by evidence of similar temporal behavioral patterns that extend beyond coincidental synchronicity across a group of accounts. We propose a framework to model complex coordination patterns across multiple online modalities. This framework utilizes multiplex networks to first decompose online activities into different interaction layers, and subsequently aggregate evidence of online coordination across the layers. In addition, we propose a time-aware collaboration model to capture patterns of online coordination for each modality. The proposed time-aware model builds upon the node-normalized collaboration model and accounts for repetitions of coordinated actions over different time intervals by employing an exponential decay temporal kernel. We validate our approach on multiple datasets featuring different coordinated activities. Our results demonstrate that a multiplex time-aware model excels in the identification of coordinating groups, outperforming previously proposed methods in coordinated activity detection.

### 5. [Laplacian Network Optimization via Information Functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19279v1)

Authors: Samuel Rosa, Radoslav Harman

Designing networks to optimize robustness and other performance metrics is a well-established problem with applications ranging from electrical engineering to communication networks. Many such performance measures rely on the Laplacian spectrum; notable examples include total effective resistance, the number of spanning trees, and algebraic connectivity. This paper advances the study of Laplacian-based network optimization by drawing on ideas from experimental design in statistics. We present a theoretical framework for analyzing performance measures by introducing the notion of information functions, which captures a set of their desirable properties. Then, we formulate a new parametric family of information functions, Kiefer's measures, which encompasses the three most common spectral objectives. We provide a regular reformulation of the Laplacian optimization problem, and we use this reformulation to compute directional derivatives of Kiefer's measures. The directional derivatives provide a unified treatment of quantities recurring in Laplacian optimization, such as gradients and subgradients, and we show that they are connected to Laplacian-based measures of node distance, which we call node dissimilarities. We apply the node dissimilarities to derive efficient rank-one update formulas for Kiefer's criteria, and to devise a new edge-exchange method for network optimization. These update formulas enable greedy and exchange algorithms with reduced asymptotic time complexity.

### 1. [Toward Scalable and Valid Conditional Independence Testing with Spectral Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19510v1)

Authors: Alek Frohlich, Vladimir Kostic, Karim Lounici, Daniel Perazzo, Massimiliano Pontil

Conditional independence (CI) is central to causal inference, feature selection, and graphical modeling, yet it is untestable in many settings without additional assumptions. Existing CI tests often rely on restrictive structural conditions, limiting their validity on real-world data. Kernel methods using the partial covariance operator offer a more principled approach but suffer from limited adaptivity, slow convergence, and poor scalability. In this work, we explore whether representation learning can help address these limitations. Specifically, we focus on representations derived from the singular value decomposition of the partial covariance operator and use them to construct a simple test statistic, reminiscent of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). We also introduce a practical bi-level contrastive algorithm to learn these representations. Our theory links representation learning error to test performance and establishes asymptotic validity and power guarantees. Preliminary experiments suggest that this approach offers a practical and statistically grounded path toward scalable CI testing, bridging kernel-based theory with modern representation learning.

### 2. [Deep Learning for Primordial $B$-mode Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19577v1)

Authors: Eric Guzman, Joel Meyers

The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be applied to estimate and remove multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, and we further show how this technique can be used in a likelihood analysis to produce nearly optimal, unbiased estimates of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.

### 3. [Cluster-Based Generalized Additive Models Informed by Random Fourier Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19373v1)

Authors: Xin Huang, Jia Li, Jun Yu

Explainable machine learning aims to strike a balance between prediction accuracy and model transparency, particularly in settings where black-box predictive models, such as deep neural networks or kernel-based methods, achieve strong empirical performance but remain difficult to interpret. This work introduces a mixture of generalized additive models (GAMs) in which random Fourier feature (RFF) representations are leveraged to uncover locally adaptive structure in the data. In the proposed method, an RFF-based embedding is first learned and then compressed via principal component analysis. The resulting low-dimensional representations are used to perform soft clustering of the data through a Gaussian mixture model. These cluster assignments are then applied to construct a mixture-of-GAMs framework, where each local GAM captures nonlinear effects through interpretable univariate smooth functions. Numerical experiments on real-world regression benchmarks, including the California Housing, NASA Airfoil Self-Noise, and Bike Sharing datasets, demonstrate improved predictive performance relative to classical interpretable models. Overall, this construction provides a principled approach for integrating representation learning with transparent statistical modeling.

### 4. [A Convex Loss Function for Set Prediction with Optimal Trade-offs Between Size and Conditional Coverage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19142v1)

Authors: Francis Bach

We consider supervised learning problems in which set predictions provide explicit uncertainty estimates. Using Choquet integrals (a.k.a. Lov{á}sz extensions), we propose a convex loss function for nondecreasing subset-valued functions obtained as level sets of a real-valued function. This loss function allows optimal trade-offs between conditional probabilistic coverage and the ''size'' of the set, measured by a non-decreasing submodular function. We also propose several extensions that mimic loss functions and criteria for binary classification with asymmetric losses, and show how to naturally obtain sets with optimized conditional coverage. We derive efficient optimization algorithms, either based on stochastic gradient descent or reweighted least-squares formulations, and illustrate our findings with a series of experiments on synthetic datasets for classification and regression tasks, showing improvements over approaches that aim for marginal coverage.

### 5. [On Conditional Stochastic Interpolation for Generative Nonlinear Sufficient Dimension Reduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18971v1)

Authors: Shuntuo Xu, Zhou Yu, Jian Huang

Identifying low-dimensional sufficient structures in nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) has long been a fundamental yet challenging problem. Most existing methods lack theoretical guarantees of exhaustiveness in identifying lower dimensional structures, either at the population level or at the sample level. We tackle this issue by proposing a new method, generative sufficient dimension reduction (GenSDR), which leverages modern generative models. We show that GenSDR is able to fully recover the information contained in the central $σ$-field at both the population and sample levels. In particular, at the sample level, we establish a consistency property for the GenSDR estimator from the perspective of conditional distributions, capitalizing on the distributional learning capabilities of deep generative models. Moreover, by incorporating an ensemble technique, we extend GenSDR to accommodate scenarios with non-Euclidean responses, thereby substantially broadening its applicability. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the outstanding empirical performance of GenSDR and highlight its strong potential for addressing a wide range of complex, real-world tasks.

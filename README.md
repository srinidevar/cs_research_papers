### 1. [Multi-View Stenosis Classification Leveraging Transformer-Based Multiple-Instance Learning Using Real-World Clinical Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02067v1)

Authors: Nikola Cenikj, Özgün Turgut, Alexander Müller, Alexander Steger, Jan Kehrer, Marcus Brugger, Daniel Rueckert, Eimo Martens, Philip Müller

Coronary artery stenosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, diagnosed by analyzing the coronary arteries from multiple angiography views. Although numerous deep-learning models have been proposed for stenosis detection from a single angiography view, their performance heavily relies on expensive view-level annotations, which are often not readily available in hospital systems. Moreover, these models fail to capture the temporal dynamics and dependencies among multiple views, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. To address this, we propose SegmentMIL, a transformer-based multi-view multiple-instance learning framework for patient-level stenosis classification. Trained on a real-world clinical dataset, using patient-level supervision and without any view-level annotations, SegmentMIL jointly predicts the presence of stenosis and localizes the affected anatomical region, distinguishing between the right and left coronary arteries and their respective segments. SegmentMIL obtains high performance on internal and external evaluations and outperforms both view-level models and classical MIL baselines, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable and scalable solution for coronary stenosis diagnosis. Our code is available at https://github.com/NikolaCenic/mil-stenosis.

### 2. [FiLoRA: Focus-and-Ignore LoRA for Controllable Feature Reliance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02060v1)

Authors: Hyunsuk Chung, Caren Han, Yerin Choi, Seungyeon Ji, Jinwoo Kim, Eun-Jung Holden, Kyungreem Han

Multimodal foundation models integrate heterogeneous signals across modalities, yet it remains poorly understood how their predictions depend on specific internal feature groups and whether such reliance can be deliberately controlled. Existing studies of shortcut and spurious behavior largely rely on post hoc analyses or feature removal, offering limited insight into whether reliance can be modulated without altering task semantics. We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions. Across text--image and audio--visual benchmarks, we show that instruction-conditioned gating induces consistent and causal shifts in internal computation, selectively amplifying or suppressing core and spurious feature groups without modifying the label space or training objective. Further analyses demonstrate that FiLoRA yields improved robustness under spurious feature interventions, revealing a principled mechanism to regulate reliance beyond correlation-driven learning.

### 3. [Bandwidth-Efficient Multi-Agent Communication through Information Bottleneck and Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02035v1)

Authors: Ahmad Farooq, Kamran Iqbal

Multi-agent reinforcement learning systems deployed in real-world robotics applications face severe communication constraints that significantly impact coordination effectiveness. We present a framework that combines information bottleneck theory with vector quantization to enable selective, bandwidth-efficient communication in multi-agent environments. Our approach learns to compress and discretize communication messages while preserving task-critical information through principled information-theoretic optimization. We introduce a gated communication mechanism that dynamically determines when communication is necessary based on environmental context and agent states. Experimental evaluation on challenging coordination tasks demonstrates that our method achieves 181.8% performance improvement over no-communication baselines while reducing bandwidth usage by 41.4%. Comprehensive Pareto frontier analysis shows dominance across the entire success-bandwidth spectrum with area-under-curve of 0.198 vs 0.142 for next-best methods. Our approach significantly outperforms existing communication strategies and establishes a theoretically grounded framework for deploying multi-agent systems in bandwidth-constrained environments such as robotic swarms, autonomous vehicle fleets, and distributed sensor networks.

### 4. [Do I Really Know? Learning Factual Self-Verification for Hallucination Reduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02018v1)

Authors: Enes Altinisik, Masoomali Fatehkia, Fatih Deniz, Nadir Durrani, Majd Hawasly, Mohammad Raza, Husrev Taha Sencar

Factual hallucination remains a central challenge for large language models (LLMs). Existing mitigation approaches primarily rely on either external post-hoc verification or mapping uncertainty directly to abstention during fine-tuning, often resulting in overly conservative behavior. We propose VeriFY, a training-time framework that teaches LLMs to reason about factual uncertainty through consistency-based self-verification. VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guide the model to produce an initial answer, generate and answer a probing verification query, issue a consistency judgment, and then decide whether to answer or abstain. To address the risk of reinforcing hallucinated content when training on augmented traces, we introduce a stage-level loss masking approach that excludes hallucinated answer stages from the training objective while preserving supervision over verification behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, VeriFY reduces factual hallucination rates by 9.7 to 53.3 percent, with only modest reductions in recall (0.4 to 5.7 percent), and generalizes across datasets when trained on a single source. The source code, training data, and trained model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

### 5. [ClueTracer: Question-to-Vision Clue Tracing for Training-Free Hallucination Suppression in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02004v1)

Authors: Gongli Xi, Kun Wang, Zeming Gao, Huahui Yi, Haolang Lu, Ye Tian, Wendong Wang

Large multimodal reasoning models solve challenging visual problems via explicit long-chain inference: they gather visual clues from images and decode clues into textual tokens. Yet this capability also increases hallucinations, where the model generates content that is not supported by the input image or the question. To understand this failure mode, we identify \emph{reasoning drift}: during clue gathering, the model over-focuses on question-irrelevant entities, diluting focus on task-relevant cues and gradually decoupling the reasoning trace from visual grounding. As a consequence, many inference-time localization or intervention methods developed for non-reasoning models fail to pinpoint the true clues in reasoning settings. Motivated by these insights, we introduce ClueRecall, a metric for assessing visual clue retrieval, and present ClueTracer, a training-free, parameter-free, and architecture-agnostic plugin for hallucination suppression. ClueTracer starts from the question and traces how key clues propagate along the model's reasoning pathway (question $\rightarrow$ outputs $\rightarrow$ visual tokens), thereby localizing task-relevant patches while suppressing spurious attention to irrelevant regions. Remarkably, \textbf{without any additional training}, ClueTracer improves all \textbf{reasoning} architectures (including \texttt{R1-OneVision}, \texttt{Ocean-R1}, \texttt{MM-Eureka}, \emph{etc}.) by $\mathbf{1.21\times}$ on reasoning benchmarks. When transferred to \textbf{non-reasoning} settings, it yields a $\mathbf{1.14\times}$ gain.

### 6. [SurfSplat: Conquering Feedforward 2D Gaussian Splatting with Surface Continuity Priors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02000v1)

Authors: Bing He, Jingnan Gao, Yunuo Chen, Ning Cao, Gang Chen, Zhengxue Cheng, Li Song, Wenjun Zhang

Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse images remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of recovering accurate geometry and texture without optimization. Recent approaches leverage generalizable models to generate 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) primitive. However, they often fail to produce continuous surfaces and instead yield discrete, color-biased point clouds that appear plausible at normal resolution but reveal severe artifacts under close-up views. To address this issue, we present SurfSplat, a feedforward framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitive, which provides stronger anisotropy and higher geometric precision. By incorporating a surface continuity prior and a forced alpha blending strategy, SurfSplat reconstructs coherent geometry together with faithful textures. Furthermore, we introduce High-Resolution Rendering Consistency (HRRC), a new evaluation metric designed to evaluate high-resolution reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

### 7. [PIMCST: Physics-Informed Multi-Phase Consensus and Spatio-Temporal Few-Shot Learning for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01936v1)

Authors: Abdul Joseph Fofanah, Lian Wen, David Chen

Accurate traffic flow prediction remains a fundamental challenge in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in cross-domain, data-scarce scenarios where limited historical data hinders model training and generalisation. The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/afofanah/MCPST.

### 8. [COLT: Lightweight Multi-LLM Collaboration through Shared MCTS Reasoning for Model Compilation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01935v1)

Authors: Annabelle Sujun Tang, Christopher Priebe, Lianhui Qin, Hadi Esmaeilzadeh

Model serving costs dominate AI systems, making compiler optimization essential for scalable deployment. Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models.

### 9. [Geometric Analysis of Token Selection in Multi-Head Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01893v1)

Authors: Timur Mudarisov, Mikhal Burtsev, Tatiana Petrova, Radu State

We present a geometric framework for analysing multi-head attention in large language models (LLMs). Without altering the mechanism, we view standard attention through a top-N selection lens and study its behaviour directly in value-state space. We define geometric metrics - Precision, Recall, and F-score - to quantify separability between selected and non-selected tokens, and derive non-asymptotic bounds with explicit dependence on dimension and margin under empirically motivated assumptions (stable value norms with a compressed sink token, exponential similarity decay, and piecewise attention weight profiles). The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics. Empirically, across LLaMA-2-7B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B, measurements closely track the theoretical envelopes: top-N selection sharpens separability, sink similarity correlates with Recall. We also found that in LLaMA-2-7B heads specialize into three regimes - Retriever, Mixer, Reset - with distinct geometric signatures. Overall, attention behaves as a structured geometric classifier with measurable criteria for token selection, offering head level interpretability and informing geometry-aware sparsification and design of attention in LLMs.

### 10. [SOPRAG: Multi-view Graph Experts Retrieval for Industrial Standard Operating Procedures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01858v1)

Authors: Liangtao Lin, Zhaomeng Zhu, Tianwei Zhang, Yonggang Wen

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are essential for ensuring operational safety and consistency in industrial environments. However, retrieving and following these procedures presents unique challenges, such as rigid proprietary structures, condition-dependent relevance, and actionable execution requirement, which standard semantic-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms fail to address. Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, we propose SOPRAG, a novel framework specifically designed to address the above pain points in SOP retrieval. SOPRAG replaces flat chunking with specialized Entity, Causal, and Flow graph experts to resolve industrial structural and logical complexities. To optimize and coordinate these experts, we propose a Procedure Card layer that prunes the search space to eliminate computational noise, and an LLM-Guided gating mechanism that dynamically weights these experts to align retrieval with operator intent. To address the scarcity of domain-specific data, we also introduce an automated, multi-agent workflow for benchmark construction. Extensive experiments across four industrial domains demonstrate that SOPRAG significantly outperforms strong lexical, dense, and graph-based RAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response utility, achieving perfect execution scores in real-world critical tasks.

### Hardware Architecture

### 1. [Ultrafast On-chip Online Learning via Spline Locality in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02056v1)

Authors: Duc Hoang, Aarush Gupta, Philip Harris

Ultrafast online learning is essential for high-frequency systems, such as controls for quantum computing and nuclear fusion, where adaptation must occur on sub-microsecond timescales. Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate model-free online learning at sub-microsecond latencies.

### 2. [NeuroAI Temporal Neural Networks (NeuTNNs): Microarchitecture and Design Framework for Specialized Neuromorphic Processing Units](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01546v1)

Authors: Shanmuga Venkatachalam, Prabhu Vellaisamy, Harideep Nair, Wei-Che Huang, Youngseok Na, Yuyang Kang, Quinn Jacobson, John Paul Shen

Leading experts from both communities have suggested the need to (re)connect research in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the development of next-generation AI innovations. They term this convergence as NeuroAI. Previous research has established temporal neural networks (TNNs) as a promising neuromorphic approach toward biological intelligence and efficiency. We fully embrace NeuroAI and propose a new category of TNNs we call NeuroAI TNNs (NeuTNNs) with greater capability and hardware efficiency by adopting neuroscience findings, including a neuron model with active dendrites and a hierarchy of distal and proximal segments. This work introduces a PyTorch-to-layout tool suite (NeuTNNGen) to design application-specific NeuTNNs. Compared to previous TNN designs, NeuTNNs achieve superior performance and efficiency. We demonstrate NeuTNNGen's capabilities using three example applications: 1) UCR time series benchmarks, 2) MNIST design exploration, and 3) Place Cells design for neocortical reference frames. We also explore using synaptic pruning to further reduce synapse counts and hardware costs by 30-50% while maintaining model precision across diverse sensory modalities. NeuTNNGen can facilitate the design of application-specific energy-efficient NeuTNNs for the next generation of NeuroAI computing systems.

### 3. [Governance at the Edge of Architecture: Regulating NeuroAI and Neuromorphic Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01503v1)

Authors: Afifah Kashif, Abdul Muhsin Hameed, Asim Iqbal

Current AI governance frameworks, including regulatory benchmarks for accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency, are built for static, centrally trained artificial neural networks on von Neumann hardware. NeuroAI systems, embodied in neuromorphic hardware and implemented via spiking neural networks, break these assumptions. This paper examines the limitations of current AI governance frameworks for NeuroAI, arguing that assurance and audit methods must co-evolve with these architectures, aligning traditional regulatory metrics with the physics, learning dynamics, and embodied efficiency of brain-inspired computation to enable technically grounded assurance.

### 4. [In-Pipeline Integration of Digital In-Memory-Computing into RISC-V Vector Architecture to Accelerate Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01827v1)

Authors: Tommaso Spagnolo, Cristina Silvano, Riccardo Massa, Filippo Grillotti, Thomas Boesch, Giuseppe Desoli

Expanding Deep Learning applications toward edge computing demands architectures capable of delivering high computational performance and efficiency while adhering to tight power and memory constraints. Digital In-Memory Computing (DIMC) addresses this need by moving part of the computation directly within memory arrays, significantly reducing data movement and improving energy efficiency. This paper introduces a novel architecture that extends the Vector RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to integrate a tightly coupled DIMC unit directly into the execution stage of the pipeline, to accelerate Deep Learning inference at the edge. Specifically, the proposed approach adds four custom instructions dedicated to data loading, computation, and write-back, enabling flexible and optimal control of the inference execution on the target architecture. Experimental results demonstrate high utilization of the DIMC tile in Vector RISC-V and sustained throughput across the ResNet-50 model, achieving a peak performance of 137 GOP/s. The proposed architecture achieves a speedup of 217x over the baseline core and 50x area-normalized speedup even when operating near the hardware resource limits. The experimental results confirm the high potential of the proposed architecture as a scalable and efficient solution to accelerate Deep Learning inference on the edge.

### 5. [Position: The Need for Ultrafast Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02005v1)

Authors: Duc Hoang

Domain-specialized FPGAs have delivered unprecedented performance for low-latency inference across scientific and industrial workloads, yet nearly all existing accelerators assume static models trained offline, relegating learning and adaptation to slower CPUs or GPUs. This separation fundamentally limits systems that must operate in non-stationary, high-frequency environments, where model updates must occur at the timescale of the underlying physics. In this paper, I argue for a shift from inference-only accelerators to ultrafast on-chip learning, in which both inference and training execute directly within the FPGA fabric under deterministic, sub-microsecond latency constraints. Bringing learning into the same real-time datapath as inference would enable closed-loop systems that adapt as fast as the physical processes they control, with applications spanning quantum error correction, cryogenic qubit calibration, plasma and fusion control, accelerator tuning, and autonomous scientific experiments. Enabling such regimes requires rethinking algorithms, architectures, and toolflows jointly, but promises to transform FPGAs from static inference engines into real-time learning machines.

### 6. [Optimizing Tensor Train Decomposition in DNNs for RISC-V Architectures Using Design Space Exploration and Compiler Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01996v1)

Authors: Theologos Anthimopoulos, Milad Kokhazadeh, Vasilios Kelefouras, Benjamin Himpel, Georgios Keramidas

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become indispensable in many real-life applications like natural language processing, and autonomous systems. However, deploying DNNs on resource-constrained devices, e.g., in RISC-V platforms, remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of fully connected (FC) layers, which dominate resource consumption. Low-rank factorization (LRF) offers an effective approach to compressing FC layers, but the vast design space of LRF solutions involves complex trade-offs among FLOPs, memory size, inference time, and accuracy, making the LRF process complex and time-consuming. This paper introduces an end-to-end LRF design space exploration methodology and a specialized design tool for optimizing FC layers on RISC-V processors. Using Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offered by TensorFlow T3F library, the proposed work prunes the LRF design space by excluding first, inefficient decomposition shapes and second, solutions with poor inference performance on RISC-V architectures. Compiler optimizations are then applied to enhance custom T3F layer performance, minimizing inference time and boosting computational efficiency. On average, our TT-decomposed layers run 3x faster than IREE and 8x faster than Pluto on the same compressed model. This work provides an efficient solution for deploying DNNs on edge and embedded devices powered by RISC-V architectures.

### 7. [CHAOS: Controlled Hardware fAult injectOr System for gem5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02119v1)

Authors: Elio Vinciguerra, Enrico Russo, Giuseppe Ascia, Maurizio Palesi

Fault injectors are essential tools for evaluating the reliability and resilience of computing systems. They enable the simulation of hardware and software faults to analyze system behavior under error conditions and assess its ability to operate correctly despite disruptions. Such analysis is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and improving system robustness. CHAOS is a modular, open-source, and fully configurable fault injection framework designed for the gem5 simulator. It facilitates precise and systematic fault injection across multiple architectural levels, supporting comprehensive evaluations of fault tolerance mechanisms and resilience strategies. Its high configurability and seamless integration with gem5 allow researchers to explore a wide range of fault models and complex scenarios, making CHAOS a valuable tool for advancing research in dependable and high-performance computing systems.

### Computational Complexity

### 1. [The SPARSE-Relativization Framework and Applications to Optimal Proof Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02294v1)

Authors: Fabian Egidy

We investigate the following longstanding open questions raised by Krajíček and Pudlák (J. Symb. L. 1989), Sadowski (FCT 1997), Köbler and Messner (CCC 1998) and Messner (PhD 2000).
  Q1: Does TAUT have (p-)optimal proof systems?
  Q2: Does QBF have (p-)optimal proof systems?
  Q3: Are there arbitrarily complex sets with (p-)optimal proof systems?
  Recently, Egidy and Glaßer (STOC 2025) contributed to these questions by constructing oracles that show that there are no relativizable proofs for positive answers of these questions, even when assuming well-established conjectures about the separation of complexity classes. We continue this line of research by providing the same proof barrier for negative answers of these questions. For this, we introduce the SPARSE-relativization framework, which is an application of the notion of bounded relativization by Hirahara, Lu, and Ren (CCC 2023). This framework allows the construction of sparse oracles for statements such that additional useful properties (like an infinite polynomial-time hierarchy) hold. By applying the SPARSE-relativization framework, we show that the oracle construction of Egidy and Glaßer also yields the following new oracle.
  O1: No set in PSPACE\NP has optimal proof systems, $\mathrm{NP} \subsetneq \mathrm{PH} \subsetneq \mathrm{PSPACE}$, and PH collapses
  We use techniques of Cook and Krajíček (J. Symb. L. 2007) and Beyersdorff, Köbler, and Müller (Inf. Comp. 2011) and apply our SPARSE-relativization framework to obtain the following new oracle.
  O2: All sets in PSPACE have p-optimal proof systems, there are arbitrarily complex sets with p-optimal proof systems, and PH is infinite
  Together with previous results, our oracles show that questions Q1 and Q2 are independent of an infinite or collapsing polynomial-time hierarchy.

### 2. [A Provable Expressiveness Hierarchy in Hybrid Linear-Full Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01763v1)

Authors: Xiaowei Ye, Xiaoyu He, Chao Liao, Chen Wu, Pinyan Lu

Transformers serve as the foundation of most modern large language models. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of standard full attention, various efficient attention mechanisms, such as linear and hybrid attention, have been developed. A fundamental gap remains: their expressive power relative to full attention lacks a rigorous theoretical characterization. In this work, we theoretically characterize the performance differences among these attention mechanisms. Our theory applies to all linear attention variants that can be formulated as a recurrence, including Mamba, DeltaNet, etc. Specifically, we establish an expressiveness hierarchy: for the sequential function composition-a multi-step reasoning task that must occur within a model's forward pass, an ($L+1$)-layer full attention network is sufficient, whereas any hybrid network interleaving $L-1$ layers of full attention with a substantially larger number ($2^{3L^2}$) of linear attention layers cannot solve it. This result demonstrates a clear separation in expressive power between the two types of attention. Our work provides the first provable separation between hybrid attention and standard full attention, offering a theoretical perspective for understanding the fundamental capabilities and limitations of different attention mechanisms.

### 3. [$m$-Eternal Dominating Set Problem on Subclasses of Chordal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02135v1)

Authors: Ashutosh Rai, Soumyashree Rana

A dominating set of a graph G(V, E) is a set of vertices D\subseteq V such that every vertex in V\D has a neighbor in D. An eternal dominating set extends this concept by placing mobile guards on the vertices of D. In response to an infinite sequence of attacks on unoccupied vertices, a guard can move to the attacked vertex from an adjacent position, ensuring that the new guards configuration remains a dominating set. In the one (all) guard(s) move model, only one (multiple) guard(s) moves(may move) per attack. The set of vertices representing the initial configuration of guards in one(all) guard move model is the eternal dominating set (m-eternal dominating set) of G. The minimum size of such a set in one(all) guard move model is called the eternal domination number (m-eternal domination number) of G, respectively. Given a graph G and an integer k, the m-Eternal Dominating Set asks whether G has an m-eternal dominating set of size at most k. In this work, we focus mainly on the computational complexity of m-Eternal Dominating Set in subclasses of chordal graphs. For split graphs, we show a dichotomy result by first designing a polynomial-time algorithm for K1,t-free split graphs with t\le 4, and then proving that the problem becomes NP-complete for t\ge 5. We showed that the problem is NP-hard on undirected path graphs. Moreover, we exhibit the computational complexity difference between the variants by showing the existence of two graph classes such that, in one, both Dominating Set and m-Eternal Dominating Set are solvable in polynomial time while Eternal Dominating Set is NP-hard, whereas in the other, Eternal Dominating Set is solvable in polynomial time and both Dominating Set and m-Eternal Dominating Set are NP-hard. Finally, we present a graph class where Dominating Set is NP-hard, but m-Eternal Dominating Set is efficiently solvable.

### 1. [Harnessing Flexible Spatial and Temporal Data Center Workloads for Grid Regulation Services](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01508v1)

Authors: Yingrui Fan, Junbo Zhao

Data centers (DCs) are increasingly recognized as flexible loads that can support grid frequency regulation. Yet, most existing methods treat workload scheduling and regulation capacity bidding separately, overlooking how queueing dynamics and spatial-temporal dispatch decisions affect the ability to sustain real-time regulation. As a result, the committed regulation may become infeasible or short-lived. To address this issue, we propose a unified day-ahead co-optimization framework that jointly decides workload distribution across geographically distributed DCs and regulation capacity commitments. We construct a space-time network model to capture workload migration costs, latency requirements, and heterogeneous resource limits. To ensure that the committed regulation remains deliverable, we introduce chance constraints on instantaneous power flexibility based on interactive load forecasts, and apply Value-at-Risk queue-state constraints to maintain sustainable response under cumulative regulation signals. Case studies on a modified IEEE 68-bus system using real data center traces show that the proposed framework lowers system operating costs, enables more viable regulation capacity, and achieves better revenue-risk trade-offs compared to strategies that optimize scheduling and regulation independently.

### 2. [FluxNet: Learning Capacity-Constrained Local Transport Operators for Conservative and Bounded PDE Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01941v1)

Authors: Zishuo Lan, Junjie Li, Lei Wang, Jincheng Wang

Autoregressive learning of time-stepping operators offers an effective approach to data-driven PDE simulation on grids. For conservation laws, however, long-horizon rollouts are often destabilized when learned updates violate global conservation and, in many applications, additional state bounds such as nonnegative mass and densities or concentrations constrained to [0,1]. Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition. Experiments on shallow-water equations and traffic flow show improved rollout stability and physical consistency over strong baselines. On phase-field spinodal decomposition, the method enables large time-steps with long-range transport, accelerating simulation while preserving microstructure evolution in both pointwise and statistical measures.

### 3. [Mutual-Guided Expert Collaboration for Cross-Subject EEG Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01728v1)

Authors: Zhi Zhang, Yan Liu, Zhejing Hu, Gong Chen, Jiannong Cao, Shenghua Zhong, Sean Fontaine, Changhong Jing, Shuqiang Wang

Decoding the human brain from electroencephalography (EEG) signals holds promise for understanding neurological activities. However, EEG data exhibit heterogeneity across subjects and sessions, limiting the generalization of existing methods. Representation learning approaches sacrifice subject-specific information for domain invariance, while ensemble learning methods risk error accumulation for unseen subjects. From a theoretical perspective, we reveal that the applicability of these paradigms depends on the reducibility cost of domain-specific functions to domain-invariant ones. Building on this insight, we propose a Mutual-Guided Expert Collaboration (MGEC) framework that employs distinct network structures aligned with domain-specific and domain-invariant functions. Shared expert-guided learning captures reducible domain-invariant functions. Routed expert-guided learning employs a mixture-of-experts architecture to model irreducible domain-specific functions. Mutual-guided learning enables collaborative regularization to prevent over-reduction and under-reduction. We validate our theoretical findings on synthetic datasets, and experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that MGEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### 4. [Cell-JEPA: Latent Representation Learning for Single-Cell Transcriptomics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02093v1)

Authors: Ali ElSheikh, Rui-Xi Wang, Weimin Wu, Yibo Wen, Payam Dibaeinia, Jennifer Yuntong Zhang, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Mei Knudson, Sudarshan Babu, Shao-Hua Sun, Aly A. Khan, Han Liu

Single-cell foundation models learn by reconstructing masked gene expression, implicitly treating technical noise as signal. With dropout rates exceeding 90%, reconstruction objectives encourage models to encode measurement artifacts rather than stable cellular programs. We introduce Cell-JEPA, a joint-embedding predictive architecture that shifts learning from reconstructing sparse counts to predicting in latent space. The key insight is that cell identity is redundantly encoded across genes. We show predicting cell-level embeddings from partial observations forces the model to learn dropout-robust features. On cell-type clustering, Cell-JEPA achieves 0.72 AvgBIO in zero-shot transfer versus 0.53 for scGPT, a 36% relative improvement. On perturbation prediction within a single cell line, Cell-JEPA improves absolute-state reconstruction but not effect-size estimation, suggesting that representation learning and perturbation modeling address complementary aspects of cellular prediction.

### 5. [Modelling Socio-Psychological Drivers of Land Management Intensity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02347v1)

Authors: Ronja Hotz, Calum Brown, Yongchao Zeng, Thomas Schmitt, Mark Rounsevell

Land management intensity shapes ecosystem service provision, socio-ecological resilience and is central to sustainable transformation. Yet most land use models emphasise economic and biophysical drivers, while socio-psychological factors influencing land managers' decisions remain underrepresented despite increasing evidence that they shape land management choices. To address this gap, we develop a generic behavioural extension for agent-based land use models, guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an overarching conceptual framework. The extension integrates environmental attitudes, descriptive social norms and behavioural inertia into land managers' decisions on land management intensity. To demonstrate applicability, the extension is coupled to an existing land use modelling framework and explored in stylised settings to isolate behavioural mechanisms. Results show that socio-psychological drivers can significantly alter land management intensity shares, landscape configuration, and ecosystem service provision. Nonlinear feedbacks between these drivers, spatial resource heterogeneity, and ecosystem service demand lead to emergent dynamics that are sometimes counter-intuitive and can diverge from the agent-level decision rules. Increasing the influence of social norms generates spatial clustering and higher landscape connectivity, while feedbacks between behavioural factors can lead to path dependence, lock-in effects, and the emergence of multiple stable regimes with sharp transitions. The proposed framework demonstrates how even low levels of behavioural diversity and social interactions can reshape system-level land use outcomes and provides a reusable modelling component for incorporating socio-psychological processes into land use simulations. The approach can be integrated into other agent-based land use models and parameterised empirically in future work.

Authors: Samundra Karki, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian

Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for geometric representation, yet their suitability for physics-based simulation remains underexplored. While metrics like Hausdorff distance quantify surface reconstruction quality, they fail to capture the geometric regularity required for provable numerical performance. This work establishes a unified theoretical framework connecting INR training errors to Partial Differential Equation (PDE) (specifically, linear elliptic equation) solution accuracy. We define the minimal geometric regularity required for INRs to support well-posed boundary value problems and derive \emph{a priori} error estimates linking the neural network's function approximation error to the finite element discretization error. Our analysis reveals that to match the convergence rate of linear finite elements, the INR training loss must scale quadratically relative to the mesh size.

Authors: Ryan Huynh, Frank Guerin, Alison Callwood

Assessing soft skills such as empathy, ethical judgment, and communication is essential in competitive selection processes, yet human scoring is often inconsistent and biased. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved Automated Essay Scoring (AES), we show that state-of-the-art rationale-based fine-tuning methods struggle with the abstract, context-dependent nature of Multiple Mini-Interviews (MMIs), missing the implicit signals embedded in candidate narratives. We introduce a multi-agent prompting framework that breaks down the evaluation process into transcript refinement and criterion-specific scoring. Using 3-shot in-context learning with a large instruct-tuned model, our approach outperforms specialised fine-tuned baselines (Avg QWK 0.62 vs 0.32) and achieves reliability comparable to human experts. We further demonstrate the generalisability of our framework on the ASAP benchmark, where it rivals domain-specific state-of-the-art models without additional training. These findings suggest that for complex, subjective reasoning tasks, structured prompt engineering may offer a scalable alternative to data-intensive fine-tuning, altering how LLMs can be applied to automated assessment.

Authors: Liang Lin, Feng Xiong, Zengbin Wang, Kun Wang, Junhao Dong, Xuecai Hu, Yong Wang, Xiangxiang Chu

Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive models, enabling parallel token generation across multiple positions. However, preference alignment of DLLMs remains challenging due to high variance introduced by Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)-based likelihood estimation. In this work, we propose AR-MAP, a novel transfer learning framework that leverages preference-aligned autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) as implicit teachers for DLLM alignment. We reveal that DLLMs can effectively absorb alignment knowledge from AR-LLMs through simple weight scaling, exploiting the shared architectural structure between these divergent generation paradigms. Crucially, our approach circumvents the high variance and computational overhead of direct DLLM alignment and comprehensive experiments across diverse preference alignment tasks demonstrate that AR-MAP achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing DLLM-specific alignment methods, achieving 69.08\% average score across all tasks and models. Our Code is available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/AR-MAP.

Authors: Yuli Zhou, Qingxuan Chen, Luca Benini, Guolei Sun, Yawei Li

Adaptive Rounding has emerged as an alternative to round-to-nearest (RTN) for post-training quantization by enabling cross-element error cancellation. Yet, dense and element-wise rounding matrices are prohibitively expensive for billion-parameter large language models (LLMs). We revisit adaptive rounding from an efficiency perspective and propose VQRound, a parameter-efficient optimization framework that reparameterizes the rounding matrix into a compact codebook. Unlike low-rank alternatives, VQRound minimizes the element-wise worst-case error under $L_\infty$ norm, which is critical for handling heavy-tailed weight distributions in LLMs. Beyond reparameterization, we identify rounding initialization as a decisive factor and develop a lightweight end-to-end finetuning pipeline that optimizes codebooks across all layers using only 128 samples. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Qwen3 models demonstrate that VQRound achieves better convergence than traditional adaptive rounding at the same number of steps while using as little as 0.2% of the trainable parameters. Our results show that adaptive rounding can be made both scalable and fast-fitting. The code is available at https://github.com/zhoustan/VQRound.

Authors: Chenlong Wang, Yuhang Chen, Zhihan Hu, Dongping Chen, Wenhu Chen, Sarah Wiegreffe, Tianyi Zhou

Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMM) have demonstrated remarkable progress in both understanding and generation tasks. However, whether these two capabilities are genuinely aligned and integrated within a single model remains unclear. To investigate this question, we introduce GapEval, a bidirectional benchmark designed to quantify the gap between understanding and generation capabilities, and quantitatively measure the cognitive coherence of the two "unified" directions. Each question can be answered in both modalities (image and text), enabling a symmetric evaluation of a model's bidirectional inference capability and cross-modal consistency. Experiments reveal a persistent gap between the two directions across a wide range of UMMs with different architectures, suggesting that current models achieve only surface-level unification rather than deep cognitive convergence of the two. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an empirical study from the perspective of knowledge manipulation to illustrate the underlying limitations. Our findings indicate that knowledge within UMMs often remains disjoint. The capability emergence and knowledge across modalities are unsynchronized, paving the way for further exploration.

Authors: Haotong Yang, Zitong Wang, Shijia Kang, Siqi Yang, Wenkai Yu, Xu Niu, Yike Sun, Yi Hu, Zhouchen Lin, Muhan Zhang

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong math reasoning abilities through Reinforcement Learning with *Verifiable Rewards* (RLVR), many advanced mathematical problems are proof-based, with no guaranteed way to determine the authenticity of a proof by simple answer matching. To enable automatic verification, a Reward Model (RM) capable of reliably evaluating full proof processes is required. In this work, we design a *scalable* data-construction pipeline that, with minimal human effort, leverages LLMs to generate a large quantity of high-quality "**question-proof-check**" triplet data. By systematically varying problem sources, generation methods, and model configurations, we create diverse problem-proof pairs spanning multiple difficulty levels, linguistic styles, and error types, subsequently filtered through hierarchical human review for label alignment. Utilizing these data, we train a proof-checking RM, incorporating additional process reward and token weight balance to stabilize the RL process. Our experiments validate the model's scalability and strong performance from multiple perspectives, including reward accuracy, generalization ability and test-time guidance, providing important practical recipes and tools for strengthening LLM mathematical capabilities.

We introduce Kimi K2.5, an open-source multimodal agentic model designed to advance general agentic intelligence. K2.5 emphasizes the joint optimization of text and vision so that two modalities enhance each other. This includes a series of techniques such as joint text-vision pre-training, zero-vision SFT, and joint text-vision reinforcement learning. Building on this multimodal foundation, K2.5 introduces Agent Swarm, a self-directed parallel agent orchestration framework that dynamically decomposes complex tasks into heterogeneous sub-problems and executes them concurrently. Extensive evaluations show that Kimi K2.5 achieves state-of-the-art results across various domains including coding, vision, reasoning, and agentic tasks. Agent Swarm also reduces latency by up to $4.5\times$ over single-agent baselines. We release the post-trained Kimi K2.5 model checkpoint to facilitate future research and real-world applications of agentic intelligence.

### 7. [A Relative-Budget Theory for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards in Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01523v1)

Authors: Akifumi Wachi, Hirota Kinoshita, Shokichi Takakura, Rei Higuchi, Taiji Suzuki

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a dominant paradigm for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet its effectiveness varies across tasks and compute budgets. We propose a \emph{relative-budget} theory explaining this variation through a single quantity called relative budget $ξ:= H/\mathbb{E}[T]$, where $H$ is the generation horizon (token budget) and $T$ denotes the number of tokens until the first correct solution under a base policy. We show that $ξ$ determines sample efficiency by controlling reward variance and the likelihood of informative trajectories. Our analysis reveals three regimes: in the \emph{deficient} regime ($ξ\to 0$), informative trajectories are rare and the sample complexity explodes; in the \emph{balanced} regime ($ξ=Θ(1)$), informative trajectories occur with non-negligible probability and RL is maximally sample-efficient; and in the \emph{ample} regime ($ξ\to \infty$), learning remains stable but marginal gains per iteration diminish. We further provide finite-sample guarantees for online RL that characterize learning progress across these regimes. Specifically, in a case study under idealized distributional assumptions, we show that the relative budget grows linearly over iterations. Our empirical results confirm these predictions in realistic settings, identifying a budget $ξ\in [1.5, 2.0]$ that maximizes learning efficiency and coincides with peak reasoning performance.

### 8. [Sentence Curve Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01807v1)

Authors: DongNyeong Heo, Heelyoul Choi

Language models (LMs) are a central component of modern AI systems, and diffusion-based language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive alternative. Both paradigms rely on word embeddings not only to represent the input sentence, but also to represent the target sentence that backbone models are trained to predict. We argue that such static embedding of the target word is insensitive to neighboring words, encouraging locally accurate word prediction while neglecting global structure across the target sentence. To address this limitation, we propose a continuous sentence representation, termed sentence curve, defined as a spline curve whose control points affect multiple words in the sentence. Based on this representation, we introduce sentence curve language model (SCLM), which extends DLMs to predict sentence curves instead of the static word embeddings. We theoretically show that sentence curve prediction induces a regularization effect that promotes global structure modeling, and characterize how different sentence curve types affect this behavior. Empirically, SCLM achieves SOTA performance among DLMs on IWSLT14 and WMT14, shows stable training without burdensome knowledge distillation, and demonstrates promising potential compared to discrete DLMs on LM1B.

Authors: Doohyun Kim, Donghwa Kang, Kyungjae Lee, Hyeongboo Baek, Brent Byunghoon Kang

The proliferation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has established vector databases as critical infrastructure, yet they introduce severe privacy risks via embedding inversion attacks. Existing paradigms face a fundamental trade-off: optimization-based methods require computationally prohibitive queries, while alignment-based approaches hinge on the unrealistic assumption of accessible in-domain training data. These constraints render them ineffective in strict black-box and cross-domain settings. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce Zero2Text, a novel training-free framework based on recursive online alignment. Unlike methods relying on static datasets, Zero2Text synergizes LLM priors with a dynamic ridge regression mechanism to iteratively align generation to the target embedding on-the-fly. We further demonstrate that standard defenses, such as differential privacy, fail to effectively mitigate this adaptive threat. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate Zero2Text; notably, on MS MARCO against the OpenAI victim model, it achieves 1.8x higher ROUGE-L and 6.4x higher BLEU-2 scores compared to baselines, recovering sentences from unknown domains without a single leaked data pair.

### 10. [Game of Thought: Robust Information Seeking with Large Language Models Using Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01708v1)

Authors: Langyuan Cui, Chun Kai Ling, Hwee Tou Ng

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios where they may lack sufficient information to complete a given task. In such settings, the ability to actively seek out missing information becomes a critical capability. Existing approaches to enhancing this ability often rely on simplifying assumptions that degrade \textit{worst-case} performance. This is an issue with serious implications in high-stakes applications. In this work, we use the game of Twenty Questions to evaluate the information-seeking ability of LLMs. We introduce and formalize its adversarial counterpart, the Strategic Language Search (SLS) problem along with its variants as a two-player zero-sum extensive form game. We propose Game of Thought (GoT), a framework that applies game-theoretic techniques to approximate a Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy for the restricted variant of the game. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves worst-case performance compared to (1) direct prompting-based methods and (2) heuristic-guided search methods across all tested settings.

Authors: Changyang He, Nina Baranowska, Josu Andoni Eguíluz Castañeira, Guillem Escriba, Matthias Juentgen, Anna Via, Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius, Asia Biega

Post-market fairness monitoring is now mandated to ensure fairness and accountability for high-risk employment AI systems under emerging regulations such as the EU AI Act. However, effective fairness monitoring often requires access to sensitive personal data, which is subject to strict legal protections under data protection law. Multi-party computation (MPC) offers a promising technical foundation for compliant post-market fairness monitoring, enabling the secure computation of fairness metrics without revealing sensitive attributes. Despite growing technical interest, the operationalization of MPC-based fairness monitoring in real-world hiring contexts under concrete legal, industrial, and usability constraints remains unknown. This work addresses this gap through a co-design approach integrating technical, legal, and industrial expertise. We identify practical design requirements for MPC-based fairness monitoring, develop an end-to-end, legally compliant protocol spanning the full data lifecycle, and empirically validate it in a large-scale industrial setting. Our findings provide actionable design insights as well as legal and industrial implications for deploying MPC-based post-market fairness monitoring in algorithmic hiring systems.

### 2. [Sleep Reveals the Nonce: Breaking ECDSA using Sleep-Based Power Side-Channel Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01491v1)

Authors: Sahan Sanjaya, Prabhat Mishra

Security of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) depends on the secrecy of the per-signature nonce. Even partial nonce leakage can expose the long-term private key through lattice-based cryptanalysis. In this paper, we introduce a previously unexplored power side-channel vulnerability that exploits sleep-induced power spikes to extract ECDSA nonces. Unlike conventional power-based side-channel attacks, this vulnerability leverages power fluctuations generated during processor context switches invoked by sleep functions. These fluctuations correlate with nonce-dependent operations in scalar multiplication, enabling nonce recovery even under constant-time and masked implementations. We evaluate the attack across multiple cryptographic libraries, RustCrypto, BearSSL, and GoCrypto, and processor architectures, including ARM and RISC-V. Our experiments show that subtle variations in the power envelope during sleep-induced context switches provide sufficient leakage for practical ECDSA nonce extraction, recovering 20 bits of the nonce. These results establish sleep-induced power spikes as a practical cross-platform side-channel threat and highlight the need to reconsider design choices in cryptographic systems.

### 3. [Witnessd: Proof-of-process via Adversarial Collapse](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01663v1)

Authors: David Condrey

Digital signatures prove key possession, not authorship. An author who generates text with AI, constructs intermediate document states post-hoc, and signs each hash produces a signature chain indistinguishable from genuine composition. We address this gap between cryptographic integrity and process provenance. We introduce proof-of-process, a primitive category for evidence that a physical process, not merely a signing key, produced a digital artifact. Our construction, the jitter seal, injects imperceptible microsecond delays derived via HMAC from a session secret, keystroke ordinal, and cumulative document hash. Valid evidence requires that real keystrokes produced the document through those intermediate states. We propose the Adversarial Collapse Principle as an evaluation criterion: evidence systems should be judged by whether disputing them requires a conjunction of specific, testable allegations against components with independent trust assumptions. We present Witnessd, an architecture combining jitter seals with Verifiable Delay Functions, external timestamp anchors, dual-source keystroke validation, and optional hardware attestation. Each layer forces allegations at different capability levels; disputing authentic evidence requires coordinated claims across independent trust boundaries. The system does not prevent forgery: a kernel-level adversary can defeat it, and typing AI-generated content produces valid evidence. The contribution is converting vague doubt into falsifiable allegations. We evaluate across 31,000 verification trials with deterministic rejection of invalid proofs.

### 4. [A new criterion for the absolute irreducibility of multivariate polynomials over finite fields](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01583v1)

Authors: Carlos Agrinsoni, Heeralal Janwa, Moises Delgado

A key property of an algebraic variety is whether it is absolutely irreducible, meaning that it remains irreducible over the algebraic closure of its defining field, and determining absolute irreducibility is important in algebraic geometry and its applications in coding theory, cryptography, and other fields.
  Among the applications of absolute irreducibility are bounding the number of rational points via the Weil conjectures and establishing exceptional APN and permutation properties of functions over finite fields. In this article, we present a new criterion for the absolute irreducibility of hypersurfaces defined by multivariate polynomials over finite fields. Our criterion does not require testing for irreducibility in the ground or extension fields, assuming that the leading form is square-free. We just require multivariate GCD computations and the square-free property. Since almost all polynomials are known to be square-free, our absolute irreducibility criterion is valid for almost all multivariate polynomials.

Authors: Pengfei He, Ash Fox, Lesly Miculicich, Stefan Friedli, Daniel Fabian, Burak Gokturk, Jiliang Tang, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister, Long T. Le

Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting cybersecurity tasks, yet existing approaches struggle with automatic vulnerability discovery and exploitation due to limited interaction, weak execution grounding, and a lack of experience reuse. We propose Co-RedTeam, a security-aware multi-agent framework designed to mirror real-world red-teaming workflows by integrating security-domain knowledge, code-aware analysis, execution-grounded iterative reasoning, and long-term memory. Co-RedTeam decomposes vulnerability analysis into coordinated discovery and exploitation stages, enabling agents to plan, execute, validate, and refine actions based on real execution feedback while learning from prior trajectories. Extensive evaluations on challenging security benchmarks demonstrate that Co-RedTeam consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse backbone models, achieving over 60% success rate in vulnerability exploitation and over 10% absolute improvement in vulnerability detection. Ablation and iteration studies further confirm the critical role of execution feedback, structured interaction, and memory for building robust and generalizable cybersecurity agents.

Authors: Hoang M. Ngo, Tre' R. Jeter, Incheol Shin, Wanli Xing, Tamer Kahveci, My T. Thai

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is becoming increasingly prevalent due to its potential to enhance classical machine learning (ML) tasks, such as classification. Although quantum noise is often viewed as a major challenge in quantum computing, it also offers a unique opportunity to enhance privacy. In particular, intrinsic quantum noise provides a natural stochastic resource that, when rigorously analyzed within the differential privacy (DP) framework and composed with classical mechanisms, can satisfy formal $(\varepsilon, δ)$-DP guarantees. This enables a reduction in the required classical perturbation without compromising the privacy budget, potentially improving model utility. However, the integration of classical and quantum noise for privacy preservation remains unexplored. In this work, we propose a hybrid noise-added mechanism, HYPER-Q, that combines classical and quantum noise to protect the privacy of QML models. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its privacy guarantees and establish theoretical bounds on its utility. Empirically, we demonstrate that HYPER-Q outperforms existing classical noise-based mechanisms in terms of adversarial robustness across multiple real-world datasets.

Authors: Zeming Wei, Zhixin Zhang, Chengcan Wu, Yihao Zhang, Xiaokun Luan, Meng Sun

Recent advancements in LLMs have led to significant breakthroughs in various AI applications. However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI.

### 9. [SysFuSS: System-Level Firmware Fuzzing with Selective Symbolic Execution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02243v1)

Authors: Dakshina Tharindu, Aruna Jayasena, Prabhat Mishra

Firmware serves as the critical interface between hardware and software in computing systems, making any bugs or vulnerabilities particularly dangerous as they can cause catastrophic system failures. While fuzzing is a promising approach for identifying design flaws and security vulnerabilities, traditional fuzzers are ineffective at detecting firmware vulnerabilities. For example, existing fuzzers focus on user-level fuzzing, which is not suitable for detecting kernel-level vulnerabilities. Existing fuzzers also face a coverage plateau problem when dealing with complex interactions between firmware and hardware. In this paper, we present an efficient firmware verification framework, SysFuSS, that integrates system-level fuzzing with selective symbolic execution. Our approach leverages system-level emulation for initial fuzzing, and automatically transitions to symbolic execution when coverage reaches a plateau. This strategy enables us to generate targeted test cases that can trigger previously unexplored regions in firmware designs. We have evaluated SysFuSS on real-world embedded firmware, including OpenSSL, WolfBoot, WolfMQTT, HTSlib, MXML, and libIEC. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SysFuSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of both branch coverage and detection of firmware vulnerabilities. Specifically, SysFuSS can detect 118 known vulnerabilities while state-of-the-art can cover only 13 of them. Moreover, SysFuSS takes significantly less time (up to 3.3X, 1.7X on average) to activate these vulnerabilities.

### 10. [Decoupling Generalizability and Membership Privacy Risks in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02296v1)

Authors: Xingli Fang, Jung-Eun Kim

A deep learning model usually has to sacrifice some utilities when it acquires some other abilities or characteristics. Privacy preservation has such trade-off relationships with utilities. The loss disparity between various defense approaches implies the potential to decouple generalizability and privacy risks to maximize privacy gain. In this paper, we identify that the model's generalization and privacy risks exist in different regions in deep neural network architectures. Based on the observations that we investigate, we propose Privacy-Preserving Training Principle (PPTP) to protect model components from privacy risks while minimizing the loss in generalizability. Through extensive evaluations, our approach shows significantly better maintenance in model generalizability while enhancing privacy preservation.

Authors: Andrea Matteazzi, Dietmar Tutsch

In autonomous driving scenarios, the collected LiDAR point clouds can be challenged by occlusion and long-range sparsity, limiting the perception of autonomous driving systems. Scene completion methods can infer the missing parts of incomplete 3D LiDAR scenes. Recent methods adopt local point-level denoising diffusion probabilistic models, which require predicting Gaussian noise, leading to a mismatch between training and inference initial distributions. This paper introduces the first flow matching framework for 3D LiDAR scene completion, improving upon diffusion-based methods by ensuring consistent initial distributions between training and inference. The model employs a nearest neighbor flow matching loss and a Chamfer distance loss to enhance both local structure and global coverage in the alignment of point clouds.

Authors: Junchi Feng, Nikhil Ballem, Mahya Beheshti, Giles Hamilton-Fletcher, Todd Hudson, Maurizio Porfiri, William H. Seiple, John-Ross Rizzo

Optical character recognition (OCR), which converts printed or handwritten text into machine-readable form, is widely used in assistive technology for people with blindness and low vision. Yet, most evaluations rely on static datasets that do not reflect the challenges of mobile use. In this study, we systematically evaluated OCR performance under both static and dynamic conditions. Static tests measured detection range across distances of 1-7 meters and viewing angles of 0-75 degrees horizontally. Dynamic tests examined the impact of motion by varying walking speed from slow (0.8 m/s) to very fast (1.8 m/s) and comparing three camera mounting positions: head-mounted, shoulder-mounted, and hand-held. We evaluated both a smartphone and smart glasses, using the phone's main and ultra-wide cameras. Four OCR engines were benchmarked to assess accuracy at different distances and viewing angles: Google Vision, PaddleOCR 3.0, EasyOCR, and Tesseract. PaddleOCR 3.0 was then used to evaluate accuracy at different walking speeds. Accuracy was computed at the character level using the Levenshtein ratio against manually defined ground truth. Results showed that recognition accuracy declined with increased walking speed and wider viewing angles. Google Vision achieved the highest overall accuracy, with PaddleOCR close behind as the strongest open-source alternative. Across devices, the phone's main camera achieved the highest accuracy, and a shoulder-mounted placement yielded the highest average among body positions; however, differences among shoulder, head, and hand were not statistically significant.

Authors: Lu Cao, Xiquan He, Junying Zeng, Chaoyun Mai, Min Luo

The limited sample size and insufficient diversity of lung nodule CT datasets severely restrict the performance and generalization ability of detection models. Existing methods generate images with insufficient diversity and controllability, suffering from issues such as monotonous texture features and distorted anatomical structures. Therefore, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network (TSGAN) to enhance the diversity and spatial controllability of synthetic data by decoupling the morphological structure and texture features of lung nodules. In the first stage, StyleGAN is used to generate semantic segmentation mask images, encoding lung nodules and tissue backgrounds to control the anatomical structure of lung nodule images; The second stage uses the DL-Pix2Pix model to translate the mask map into CT images, employing local importance attention to capture local features, while utilizing dynamic weight multi-head window attention to enhance the modeling capability of lung nodule texture and background. Compared to the original dataset, the accuracy improved by 4.6% and mAP by 4% on the LUNA16 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that TSGAN can enhance the quality of synthetic images and the performance of detection models.

Authors: Wen-Jie Shu, Xuerui Qiu, Rui-Jie Zhu, Harold Haodong Chen, Yexin Liu, Harry Yang

Recent advances in visual reasoning have leveraged vision transformers to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark. However, we argue that the feed-forward architecture, where computational depth is strictly bound to parameter size, falls short of capturing the iterative, algorithmic nature of human induction. In this work, we propose a recursive architecture called Loop-ViT, which decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence. Loop-ViT iterates a weight-tied Hybrid Block, combining local convolutions and global attention, to form a latent chain of thought. Crucially, we introduce a parameter-free Dynamic Exit mechanism based on predictive entropy: the model halts inference when its internal state ``crystallizes" into a low-uncertainty attractor. Empirical results on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark validate this perspective: our 18M model achieves 65.8% accuracy, outperforming massive 73M-parameter ensembles. These findings demonstrate that adaptive iterative computation offers a far more efficient scaling axis for visual reasoning than simply increasing network width. The code is available at https://github.com/WenjieShu/LoopViT.

Authors: Albert Kwok, Zheyuan Hu, Dounia Hammou

Implicit neural representation (INR) has proven to be accurate and efficient in various domains. In this work, we explore how different neural networks can be designed as a new texture INR, which operates in a continuous manner rather than a discrete one over the input UV coordinate space. Through thorough experiments, we demonstrate that these INRs perform well in terms of image quality, with considerable memory usage and rendering inference time. We analyze the balance between these objectives. In addition, we investigate various related applications in real-time rendering and down-stream tasks, e.g. mipmap fitting and INR-space generation.

### 6. [Segment to Focus: Guiding Latent Action Models in the Presence of Distractors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02259v1)

Authors: Hamza Adnan, Matthew T. Jackson, Alexey Zakharov

Latent Action Models (LAMs) learn to extract action-relevant representations solely from raw observations, enabling reinforcement learning from unlabelled videos and significantly scaling available training data. However, LAMs face a critical challenge in disentangling action-relevant features from action-correlated noise (e.g., background motion). Failing to filter these distractors causes LAMs to capture spurious correlations and build sub-optimal latent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce MaskLAM -- a lightweight modification to LAM training to mitigate this issue by incorporating visual agent segmentation. MaskLAM utilises segmentation masks from pretrained foundation models to weight the LAM reconstruction loss, thereby prioritising salient information over background elements while requiring no architectural modifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on continuous-control MuJoCo tasks, modified with action-correlated background noise. Our approach yields up to a 4x increase in accrued rewards compared to standard baselines and a 3x improvement in the latent action quality, as evidenced by linear probe evaluation.

Authors: Nikola Cenikj, Özgün Turgut, Alexander Müller, Alexander Steger, Jan Kehrer, Marcus Brugger, Daniel Rueckert, Eimo Martens, Philip Müller

Coronary artery stenosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, diagnosed by analyzing the coronary arteries from multiple angiography views. Although numerous deep-learning models have been proposed for stenosis detection from a single angiography view, their performance heavily relies on expensive view-level annotations, which are often not readily available in hospital systems. Moreover, these models fail to capture the temporal dynamics and dependencies among multiple views, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. To address this, we propose SegmentMIL, a transformer-based multi-view multiple-instance learning framework for patient-level stenosis classification. Trained on a real-world clinical dataset, using patient-level supervision and without any view-level annotations, SegmentMIL jointly predicts the presence of stenosis and localizes the affected anatomical region, distinguishing between the right and left coronary arteries and their respective segments. SegmentMIL obtains high performance on internal and external evaluations and outperforms both view-level models and classical MIL baselines, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable and scalable solution for coronary stenosis diagnosis. Our code is available at https://github.com/NikolaCenic/mil-stenosis.

### 8. [ClueTracer: Question-to-Vision Clue Tracing for Training-Free Hallucination Suppression in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02004v1)

Authors: Gongli Xi, Kun Wang, Zeming Gao, Huahui Yi, Haolang Lu, Ye Tian, Wendong Wang

Large multimodal reasoning models solve challenging visual problems via explicit long-chain inference: they gather visual clues from images and decode clues into textual tokens. Yet this capability also increases hallucinations, where the model generates content that is not supported by the input image or the question. To understand this failure mode, we identify \emph{reasoning drift}: during clue gathering, the model over-focuses on question-irrelevant entities, diluting focus on task-relevant cues and gradually decoupling the reasoning trace from visual grounding. As a consequence, many inference-time localization or intervention methods developed for non-reasoning models fail to pinpoint the true clues in reasoning settings. Motivated by these insights, we introduce ClueRecall, a metric for assessing visual clue retrieval, and present ClueTracer, a training-free, parameter-free, and architecture-agnostic plugin for hallucination suppression. ClueTracer starts from the question and traces how key clues propagate along the model's reasoning pathway (question $\rightarrow$ outputs $\rightarrow$ visual tokens), thereby localizing task-relevant patches while suppressing spurious attention to irrelevant regions. Remarkably, \textbf{without any additional training}, ClueTracer improves all \textbf{reasoning} architectures (including \texttt{R1-OneVision}, \texttt{Ocean-R1}, \texttt{MM-Eureka}, \emph{etc}.) by $\mathbf{1.21\times}$ on reasoning benchmarks. When transferred to \textbf{non-reasoning} settings, it yields a $\mathbf{1.14\times}$ gain.

Authors: Bing He, Jingnan Gao, Yunuo Chen, Ning Cao, Gang Chen, Zhengxue Cheng, Li Song, Wenjun Zhang

Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse images remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of recovering accurate geometry and texture without optimization. Recent approaches leverage generalizable models to generate 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) primitive. However, they often fail to produce continuous surfaces and instead yield discrete, color-biased point clouds that appear plausible at normal resolution but reveal severe artifacts under close-up views. To address this issue, we present SurfSplat, a feedforward framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitive, which provides stronger anisotropy and higher geometric precision. By incorporating a surface continuity prior and a forced alpha blending strategy, SurfSplat reconstructs coherent geometry together with faithful textures. Furthermore, we introduce High-Resolution Rendering Consistency (HRRC), a new evaluation metric designed to evaluate high-resolution reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

### 10. [Boundary-Constrained Diffusion Models for Floorplan Generation: Balancing Realism and Diversity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01949v1)

Authors: Leonardo Stoppani, Davide Bacciu, Shahab Mokarizadeh

Diffusion models have become widely popular for automated floorplan generation, producing highly realistic layouts conditioned on user-defined constraints. However, optimizing for perceptual metrics such as the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) causes limited design diversity. To address this, we propose the Diversity Score (DS), a metric that quantifies layout diversity under fixed constraints. Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity. Out-Of-Distribution evaluations further demonstrate the models' reliance on dataset priors, emphasizing the need for generative systems that explicitly balance fidelity, diversity, and generalization in architectural design tasks.

Authors: Changyang He, Nina Baranowska, Josu Andoni Eguíluz Castañeira, Guillem Escriba, Matthias Juentgen, Anna Via, Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius, Asia Biega

Post-market fairness monitoring is now mandated to ensure fairness and accountability for high-risk employment AI systems under emerging regulations such as the EU AI Act. However, effective fairness monitoring often requires access to sensitive personal data, which is subject to strict legal protections under data protection law. Multi-party computation (MPC) offers a promising technical foundation for compliant post-market fairness monitoring, enabling the secure computation of fairness metrics without revealing sensitive attributes. Despite growing technical interest, the operationalization of MPC-based fairness monitoring in real-world hiring contexts under concrete legal, industrial, and usability constraints remains unknown. This work addresses this gap through a co-design approach integrating technical, legal, and industrial expertise. We identify practical design requirements for MPC-based fairness monitoring, develop an end-to-end, legally compliant protocol spanning the full data lifecycle, and empirically validate it in a large-scale industrial setting. Our findings provide actionable design insights as well as legal and industrial implications for deploying MPC-based post-market fairness monitoring in algorithmic hiring systems.

Authors: Daniel Mwesigwa, Steven J. Jackson, Christopher Csikszentmihalyi

Credit scoring is an increasingly central and contested domain of data and AI governance, frequently framed as a neutral and objective method of assessing risk across diverse economic and political contexts. Based on a nine-month ethnography of credit scoring practices in Nairobi, Kenya, we examined the sociotechnical and institutional work of data science in digital lending. While established regional telcos and banks are leveraging proprietary data to develop digital loan products, algorithmic credit scoring is being transformed by new actors, techniques, and shifting regulations. Our findings show how practitioners construct alternative data using technical and legal workarounds, formulate risk through multiple interpretations, and negotiate model performance via technical and political means. We argue that algorithmic credit scoring is accomplished through the ongoing work of alignment that stabilizes risk under conditions of persistent uncertainty, taking epistemic, modeling, and contextual forms. Extending work on alignment in HCI, we show how it operates as a two-way translation, where models are made "safe for worlds" while those worlds are reshaped to be "safe for models."

Authors: Jingyue Zhang, J. D. Zamfirescu-Pereira, Elena L. Glassman, Damien Masson, Ian Arawjo

Traditional human-computer interaction takes place through formally-specified systems like structured UIs and programming languages. Recent AI systems promise a new set of informal interactions with computers through natural language and other notational forms. These informal interactions can then lead to formal representations, but depend upon pre-existing formalisms known to both humans and AI. What about novel formalisms and notations? How are new abstractions created, evolved, and incrementally formalized over time -- and how might new systems, in turn, be explicitly designed to support these processes? We conduct a comparative historical analysis of notation development to identify some relevant characteristics. These include three social stages of notation development: invention & incubation, dispersion & divergence, and institutionalization & sanctification, as well as three functional stages: descriptive, generative, and evaluative. Within and across these stages, we detail several patterns, such as the role of linking and grounding metaphors, dimensions of meaningful variation, and analogical alignment. Finally, we offer some implications for design.

Authors: Ni Annie Yuan, Ho-chun Herbert Chang

Visual social media platforms have become primary venues for political discourse, yet we know little about how moralization operates differently across platforms and topics. Analyzing 2,027,595 TikToks and 1,126,972 Instagram posts during the 2024 US presidential election, we demonstrate that issues are not necessarily inherently moralized, but a product of audience demographics, platform architecture, and partisan framing. Using temporal supply-demand analysis and moral foundations scoring (eMFD), we examine the dynamics of key electoral issues. Three key findings emerge. First, moralization patterns diverge dramatically by platform: TikTok's algorithm enabled viral spread of moralized abortion and immigration content despite lower supply, while Instagram amplified economic discourse that aligned supply and demand. Second, traditionally "pragmatic" economic issues became moralized-cryptocurrency discourse invoked loyalty and authority foundations more strongly than any other topic, framing regulation as government overreach. Third, platforms responded to different events: TikTok surged after Harris's nomination across all topics (96% reduction in supply volatility), while Instagram spiked around cryptocurrency policy developments. Semantic network analysis reveals TikTok's circular topology enables cross-cutting exposure while Instagram's fragmented structure isolates Harris from economic discourse. These findings demonstrate that understanding political moralization requires examining platform-specific ecosystems where architecture, demographics, and content strategy interact to determine which issues get moralized and how moral content spreads.

Authors: Lucía González-Zamorano, Nuria Balbás-Esteban, Vanessa Gómez-Verdejo, Albert Belenguer-Llorens, Carlos Sevilla-Salcedo

Multimodal clinical data are characterized by high dimensionality, heterogeneous representations, and structured missingness, posing significant challenges for predictive modeling, data integration, and interpretability. We propose BIONIC (Bayesian Integration of Nonlinear Incomplete Clinical data), a unified probabilistic framework that integrates heterogeneous multimodal data under missingness through a joint generative-discriminative latent architecture. BIONIC uses pretrained embeddings for complex modalities such as medical images and clinical text, while incorporating structured clinical variables directly within a Bayesian multimodal formulation. The proposed framework enables robust learning in partially observed and semi-supervised settings by explicitly modeling modality-level and variable-level missingness, as well as missing labels. We evaluate BIONIC on three multimodal clinical and biomedical datasets, demonstrating strong and consistent discriminative performance compared to representative multimodal baselines, particularly under incomplete data scenarios. Beyond predictive accuracy, BIONIC provides intrinsic interpretability through its latent structure, enabling population-level analysis of modality relevance and supporting clinically meaningful insight.

Authors: Alexander Loth, Martin Kappes, Marc-Oliver Pahl

The growth of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has shifted disinformation production from manual fabrication to automated, large-scale manipulation. This article presents findings from the first wave of a longitudinal expert perception survey (N=21) involving AI researchers, policymakers, and disinformation specialists. It examines the perceived severity of multimodal threats -- text, image, audio, and video -- and evaluates current mitigation strategies.
  Results indicate that while deepfake video presents immediate "shock" value, large-scale text generation poses a systemic risk of "epistemic fragmentation" and "synthetic consensus," particularly in the political domain. The survey reveals skepticism about technical detection tools, with experts favoring provenance standards and regulatory frameworks despite implementation barriers.
  GenAI disinformation research requires reproducible methods. The current challenge is measurement: without standardized benchmarks and reproducibility checklists, tracking or countering synthetic media remains difficult. We propose treating information integrity as an infrastructure with rigor in data provenance and methodological reproducibility.

Authors: Naiming Liu, Richard Baraniuk, Shashank Sonkar

Large language models can generate fluent explanations, but effective tutoring requires supporting the learner's thought process, not just delivering content. Metacognitive tutoring targets this gap by prompting planning, monitoring, debugging, and evaluation, and crucially, deciding when to be active versus minimally present, based on learner signals and trajectory. We introduce MetaCLASS, a learning-science grounded framework that formulates metacognitive tutoring as move selection over 11 interpretable actions aligned to self-regulated learning processes. MetaCLASS uses a two-phase framework that first plans a pedagogical trajectory conditioned on learner profiles (calibration, help-seeking) and then generates natural dialogue consistent with that plan. This yields a dataset of 1,015 conversations (7,711 turns) annotated with turn-level metacognitive labels, and validated for pedagogical contingency and trajectory adherence. We benchmark nine LLMs on predicting the next coach move given the problem and dialogue context. The best model achieves only 43.2\% accuracy, and models exhibit compulsive intervention bias: in turns where effective metacognitive tutoring requires silent (41.7\% of cases), models predict `no intervention' only 4.2\% of the time, while severely over-predicting high-intervention moves. These results show that traditional content-based tutoring ability does not translate to metacognitive tutoring competence, positioning MetaCLASS as a testbed for developing intelligent tutors that promote self-regulated learning.

### 8. [When Feasibility of Fairness Audits Relies on Willingness to Share Data: Examining User Acceptance of Multi-Party Computation Protocols for Fairness Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01846v1)

Authors: Changyang He, Parnian Jahangirirad, Lin Kyi, Asia J. Biega

Fairness monitoring is critical for detecting algorithmic bias, as mandated by the EU AI Act. Since such monitoring requires sensitive user data (e.g., ethnicity), the AI Act permits its processing only with strict privacy measures, such as multi-party computation (MPC), in compliance with the GDPR. However, the effectiveness of such secure monitoring protocols ultimately depends on people's willingness to share their data. Little is known about how different MPC protocol designs shape user acceptance. To address this, we conducted an online survey with 833 participants in Europe, examining user acceptance of various MPC protocol designs for fairness monitoring. Findings suggest that users prioritized risk-related attributes (e.g., privacy protection mechanism) in direct evaluation but benefit-related attributes (e.g., fairness objective) in simulated choices, with acceptance shaped by their fairness and privacy orientations. We derive implications for deploying and communicating privacy-preserving protocols in ways that foster informed consent and align with user expectations.

### 9. [Are Security Cues Static? Rethinking Warning and Trust Indicators for Life Transitions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01544v1)

Authors: Sarah Tabassum

Security cues, such as warnings and trust signals, are designed as stable interface elements, even though people's lives, contexts, and vulnerabilities change over time. Life transitions including migration, aging, or shifts in institutional environments reshape how risk and trust are understood and acted upon. Yet current systems rarely adapt their security cues to these changing conditions, placing the burden of interpretation on users. In this Works-in-Progress paper, we argue that the static nature of security cues represents a design mismatch with transitional human lives. We draw on prior empirical insights from work on educational migration as a motivating case, and extend the discussion to other life transitions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Transition-Aware Security Cues (TASeC) framework and present speculative design concepts illustrating how security cues might evolve across transition stages. We invite HCI to rethink security cues as longitudinal, life-centered design elements collectively.

In recent years, the monitoring and study of natural hazards have gained significant attention, particularly due to climate change, which exacerbates incidents like floods, droughts, storm surges, and landslides. Together with the constant risk of earthquakes, these climate-induced events highlight the critical necessity for enhanced risk assessment and mitigation strategies in susceptible areas such as Italy.
  In this work, we present a Science Gateway framework for the development of portable and fully automated post-event analysis pipelines integrating Photogrammetry techniques, Data Visualization and Artificial Intelligence technologies, applied on aerial images, to assess extreme natural events and evaluate their impact on risk-exposed assets.

Authors: Wenjia Jiang, Yiwei Wang, Boyan Han, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Chi Zhang

Large Language Models have recently shown impressive capabilities in reasoning and code generation, making them promising tools for natural language interfaces to relational databases. However, existing approaches often fail to generalize in complex, real-world settings due to the highly database-specific nature of SQL reasoning, which requires deep familiarity with unique schemas, ambiguous semantics, and intricate join paths. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel two-stage LLM-based framework that decouples knowledge acquisition from query generation. In the Exploration Stage, the system autonomously constructs a database-specific knowledge base by navigating the schema with a Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired strategy, generating triplets of schema fragments, executable queries, and natural language descriptions as usage examples. In the Deployment Stage, a dual-agent system leverages the collected knowledge as in-context examples to iteratively retrieve relevant information and generate accurate SQL queries in response to user questions. This design enables the agent to proactively familiarize itself with unseen databases and handle complex, multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy over strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability.

This scientometric study analyzes Avian Influenza research from 2014 to 2023 using bibliographic data from the Web of Science database. We examined publication trends, sources, authorship, collaborative networks, document types, and geographical distribution to gain insights into the global research landscape. Results reveal a steady increase in publications, with high contributions from Chinese and American institutions. Journals such as PLoS One and the Journal of Virology published the highest number of studies, indicating their influence in this field. The most prolific institutions include the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Hong Kong, while the College of Veterinary Medicine at South China Agricultural University emerged as the most productive department. China and the USA lead in publication volume, though developed nations like the United Kingdom and Germany exhibit a higher rate of international collaboration. "Articles" are the most common document type, constituting 84.6% of the total, while "Reviews" account for 7.6%. This study provides a comprehensive view of global trends in Avian Influenza research, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts across borders.

### 3. [Meta Engine: A Unified Semantic Query Engine on Heterogeneous LLM-Based Query Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01701v1)

Authors: Ruyu Li, Tinghui Zhang, Haodi Ma, Daisy Zhe Wang, Yifan Wang

With the increasingly use of multi-modal data, semantic query has become more and more demanded in data management systems, which is an important way to access and analyze multi-modal data. As unstructured data, most information of multi-modal data (text, image, video, etc) hides in the semantics, which cannot be accessed by the traditional database queries like SQL.
  Given the power of Large Language Model (LLM) in understanding semantics and processing natural language, in recent years several LLM-based semantic query systems have been proposed, to support semantic querying over unstructured data. However, this rapid growth has produced a fragmented ecosystem. Applications face significant integration challenges due to (1) disparate APIs of different semantic query systems and (2) a fundamental trade-off between specialization and generality. Many semantic query systems are highly specialized, offering state-of-the-art performance within a single modality but struggling with multi-modal data. Conversely, some "all-in-one" systems handle multiple modalities but often exhibit suboptimal performance compared to their specialized counterparts in specific modalities.
  This paper introduces Meta Engine, a novel "query system on query systems", designed to resolve those aforementioned challenges. Meta Engine is a unified semantic query engine that integrates heterogeneous, specialized LLM-based query systems. Its architecture comprises five key components: (1) a Natural Language (NL) Query Parser, (2) an Operator Generator, (3) a Query Router, (4) a set of Adapters, and (5) a Result Aggregator. In the evaluation, Meta Engine consistently outperforms all baselines, yielding 3-6x higher F1 in most cases and up to 24x on specific datasets.

Authors: Andrey Chursin, Lefteris Kokoris-Kogias, Alex Orlov, Alberto Sonnino, Igor Zablotchi

Log-Structured Merge-Trees (LSM-trees) dominate persistent key-value storage but suffer from high write amplification from 10x to 30x under random workloads due to repeated compaction. This overhead becomes prohibitive for large values with uniformly distributed keys, a workload common in content-addressable storage, deduplication systems, and blockchain validators. We present Tidehunter, a storage engine that eliminates value compaction by treating the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) as permanent storage rather than a temporary recovery buffer. Values are never overwritten; and small, lazily-flushed index tables map keys to WAL positions. Tidehunter introduces (a) lock-free writes that saturate NVMe drives through atomic allocation and parallel copying, (b) an optimistic index structure that exploits uniform key distributions for single-roundtrip lookups, and (c) epoch-based pruning that reclaims space without blocking writes. On a 1 TB dataset with 1 KB values, Tidehunter achieves 830K writes per second, that is 8.4x higher than RocksDB and 2.9x higher than BlobDB, while improving point queries by 1.7x and existence checks by 15.6x. We validate real-world impact by integrating Tidehunter into Sui, a high-throughput blockchain, where it maintains stable throughput and latency under loads that cause RocksDB-backed validators to collapse. Tidehunter is production-ready and is being deployed in production within Sui.

Authors: Philip Stroemert, Hendrik Borgelt, David Linke, Mark Doerr, Bhavin Katabathuni, Oliver Koepler, Norbert Kockmann

Cross-domain data integration drives interdisciplinary data reuse and knowledge transfer across domains. However, each discipline maintains its own metadata schemas and domain ontologies, employing distinct conceptual models and application profiles, which complicates semantic interoperability. The W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) offers a widely adopted RDF vocabulary for describing datasets and their distributions, but its core model is intentionally lightweight. Numerous domain-specific application profiles have emerged to enrich DCAT's expressivity, the most well-known DCAT-AP for public data. To facilitate cross-domain interoperability for research data, we propose DCAT-AP PLUS, a DCAT Application Profile (P)roviding additional (L)inks to (U)se-case (S)pecific context (DCAT-AP+). This generic application profile enables a comprehensive representation of the provenance and context of research data generation. DACT-AP+ introduces an upper-level layer that can be specialized by individual domains without sacrificing compatibility. We demonstrate the application of DCAT-AP+ and a specific profile ChemDCAT-AP to showcase the potential of data integration of the neighboring disciplines chemistry and catalysis. We adopt LinkML, a YAML-based modeling framework, to support schema inheritance, generate domain-specific subschemas, and provide mechanisms for data type harmonization, validation, and format conversion, ensuring smooth integration of DCAT-AP+ and ChemDCAT-AP within existing data infrastructures.

Authors: Weiming Sheng, Jinlang Wang, Manuel Barros, Aldrin Montana, Jacopo Tagliabue, Luca Bigon

Lakehouses are the default cloud platform for analytics and AI, but they become unsafe when untrusted actors concurrently operate on production data: upstream-downstream mismatches surface only at runtime, and multi-table pipelines can leak partial effects. Inspired by software engineering, we design Bauplan, a code-first lakehouse that aims to make (most) illegal states unrepresentable using familiar abstractions. Bauplan acts along three axes: typed table contracts to make pipeline boundaries checkable, Git-like data versioning for review and reproducibility, and transactional runs that guarantee pipeline-level atomicity. We report early results from a lightweight formal transaction model and discuss future work motivated by counterexamples.

Authors: Wei Liu, Peijie Yu, Michele Orini, Yali Du, Yulan He

The agency expected of Agentic Large Language Models goes beyond answering correctly, requiring autonomy to set goals and decide what to explore. We term this investigatory intelligence, distinguishing it from executional intelligence, which merely completes assigned tasks. Data Science provides a natural testbed, as real-world analysis starts from raw data rather than explicit queries, yet few benchmarks focus on it. To address this, we introduce Deep Data Research (DDR), an open-ended task where LLMs autonomously extract key insights from databases, and DDR-Bench, a large-scale, checklist-based benchmark that enables verifiable evaluation. Results show that while frontier models display emerging agency, long-horizon exploration remains challenging. Our analysis highlights that effective investigatory intelligence depends not only on agent scaffolding or merely scaling, but also on intrinsic strategies of agentic models.

Vector databases have become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval, powering applications in recommendation, search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. However, scaling approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to high recall under strict latency SLOs remains fundamentally constrained by memory capacity and I/O bandwidth. Disk-based vector search systems suffer severe latency degradation at high accuracy, while fully in-memory solutions incur prohibitive memory costs at billion-scale. Despite the central role of caching in traditional databases, vector search lacks a general query-level caching layer capable of amortizing repeated query work.
  We present QVCache, the first backend-agnostic, query-level caching system for ANN search with bounded memory footprint. QVCache exploits semantic query repetition by performing similarity-aware caching rather than exact-match lookup. It dynamically learns region-specific distance thresholds using an online learning algorithm, enabling recall-preserving cache hits while bounding lookup latency and memory usage independently of dataset size. QVCache operates as a drop-in layer for existing vector databases. It maintains a megabyte-scale memory footprint and achieves sub-millisecond cache-hit latency, reducing end-to-end query latency by up to 40-1000x when integrated with existing ANN systems. For workloads exhibiting temporal-semantic locality, QVCache substantially reduces latency while preserving recall comparable to the underlying ANN backend, establishing it as a missing but essential caching layer for scalable vector search.

### 9. [Hippasus: Effective and Efficient Automatic Feature Augmentation for Machine Learning Tasks on Relational Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02025v1)

Authors: Serafeim Papadias, Kostas Patroumpas, Dimitrios Skoutas

Machine learning models depend critically on feature quality, yet useful features are often scattered across multiple relational tables. Feature augmentation enriches a base table by discovering and integrating features from related tables through join operations. However, scaling this process to complex schemas with many tables and multi-hop paths remains challenging. Feature augmentation must address three core tasks: identify promising join paths that connect the base table to candidate tables, execute these joins to materialize augmented data, and select the most informative features from the results. Existing approaches face a fundamental tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency: achieving high accuracy requires exploring many candidate paths, but exhaustive exploration is computationally prohibitive. Some methods compromise by considering only immediate neighbors, limiting their effectiveness, while others employ neural models that require expensive training data and introduce scalability limitations. We present Hippasus, a modular framework that achieves both goals through three key contributions. First, we combine lightweight statistical signals with semantic reasoning from Large Language Models to prune unpromising join paths before execution, focusing computational resources on high-quality candidates. Second, we employ optimized multi-way join algorithms and consolidate features from multiple paths, substantially reducing execution time. Third, we integrate LLM-based semantic understanding with statistical measures to select features that are both semantically meaningful and empirically predictive. Our experimental evaluation on publicly available datasets shows that Hippasus substantially improves feature augmentation accuracy by up to 26.8% over state-of-the-art baselines while also offering high runtime performance.

Authors: Andong Hu, Luca Pennati, Stefano Markidis, Ivy Peng

State-of-the-art AI deep potentials provide ab initio-quality results, but at a fraction of the computational cost of first-principles quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory. In this work, we bring AI deep potentials into GROMACS, a production-level Molecular Dynamics (MD) code, by integrating with DeePMD-kit that provides domain-specific deep learning (DL) models of interatomic potential energy and force fields. In particular, we enable AI deep potentials inference across multiple DP model families and DL backends by coupling GROMACS Neural Network Potentials with the C++/CUDA backend in DeePMD-kit. We evaluate two recent large-atom-model architectures, DPA2 that is based on the attention mechanism and DPA3 that is based on GNN, in GROMACS using four ab initio-quality protein-in-water benchmarks (1YRF, 1UBQ, 3LZM, 2PTC) on NVIDIA A100 and GH200 GPUs. Our results show that DPA2 delivers up to 4.23x and 3.18x higher throughput than DPA3 on A100 and GH200 GPUs, respectively. We also provide a characterization study to further contrast DPA2 and DPA3 in throughput, memory usage, and kernel-level execution on GPUs. Our findings identify kernel-launch overhead and domain-decomposed inference as the main optimization priorities for AI deep potentials in production MD simulations.

### 2. [vLLM-Omni: Fully Disaggregated Serving for Any-to-Any Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02204v1)

Authors: Peiqi Yin, Jiangyun Zhu, Han Gao, Chenguang Zheng, Yongxiang Huang, Taichang Zhou, Ruirui Yang, Weizhi Liu, Weiqing Chen, Canlin Guo, Didan Deng, Zifeng Mo, Cong Wang, James Cheng, Roger Wang, Hongsheng Liu

Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.

### 3. [ECHO-2: A Large Scale Distributed Rollout Framework for Cost-efficient Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02192v1)

Authors: Jie Xiao, Meng Chen, Qingnan Ren, Song Jingwei, Jiaqi Huang, Yangshen Deng, Chris Tong, Wanyi Chen, Suli Wang, Ziqian Bi, Shuo Lu, Yiqun Duan, Lynn Ai, Eric Yang, Bill Shi

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical stage in post-training large language models (LLMs), involving repeated interaction between rollout generation, reward evaluation, and centralized learning. Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines.

### 4. [Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01872v1)

Authors: Chongyang Xu, Christoph Siebenbrunner, Laurent Bindschaedler

Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.

### 5. [FUPareto: Bridging the Forgetting-Utility Gap in Federated Unlearning via Pareto Augmented Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01852v1)

Authors: Zeyan Wang, Zhengmao Liu, Yongxin Cai, Chi Li, Xiaoying Tang, Jingchao Chen, Zibin Pan, Jing Qiu

Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific client data from a federated model while preserving utility for the remaining clients. However, three key challenges remain: (1) existing unlearning objectives often compromise model utility or increase vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA); (2) there is a persistent conflict between forgetting and utility, where further unlearning inevitably harms retained performance; and (3) support for concurrent multi-client unlearning is poor, as gradient conflicts among clients degrade the quality of forgetting. To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts. This enables effective, fair, and concurrent unlearning for multiple clients while minimizing utility degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that FUPareto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FU methods in both unlearning efficacy and retained utility.

### 6. [Hierarchical Federated Learning with SignSGD: A Highly Communication-Efficient Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02355v1)

Authors: Amirreza Kazemi, Seyed Mohammad Azimi-Abarghouyi, Gabor Fodor, Carlo Fischione

Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as a key architecture for large-scale wireless and Internet of Things systems, where devices communicate with nearby edge servers before reaching the cloud. In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.

Authors: Leonardo Pelonero, Fabio Vitello, Eva Sciacca, Mauro Imbrosciano, Salvatore Scavo, Ugo Becciani

In recent years, the monitoring and study of natural hazards have gained significant attention, particularly due to climate change, which exacerbates incidents like floods, droughts, storm surges, and landslides. Together with the constant risk of earthquakes, these climate-induced events highlight the critical necessity for enhanced risk assessment and mitigation strategies in susceptible areas such as Italy.
  In this work, we present a Science Gateway framework for the development of portable and fully automated post-event analysis pipelines integrating Photogrammetry techniques, Data Visualization and Artificial Intelligence technologies, applied on aerial images, to assess extreme natural events and evaluate their impact on risk-exposed assets.

### 8. [TriCloudEdge: A multi-layer Cloud Continuum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02121v1)

Authors: George Violettas, Lefteris Mamatas

TriCloudEdge is a scalable three-tier cloud continuum that integrates far-edge devices, intermediate edge nodes, and central cloud services, working in parallel as a unified solution. At the far edge, ultra-low-cost microcontrollers can handle lightweight AI tasks, while intermediate edge devices provide local intelligence, and the cloud tier offers large-scale analytics, federated learning, model adaptation, and global identity management. The proposed architecture enables multi-protocols and technologies (WebSocket, MQTT, HTTP) compared to a versatile protocol (Zenoh) to transfer diverse bidirectional data across the tiers, offering a balance between computational challenges and latency requirements. Comparative implementations between these two architectures demonstrate the trade-offs between resource utilization and communication efficiency. The results show that TriCloudEdge can distribute computational challenges to address latency and privacy concerns. The work also presents tests of AI model adaptation on the far edge and the computational effort challenges under the prism of parallelism. This work offers a perspective on the practical continuum challenges of implementation aligned with recent research advances addressing challenges across the different cloud levels.

Authors: Weiming Sheng, Jinlang Wang, Manuel Barros, Aldrin Montana, Jacopo Tagliabue, Luca Bigon

Lakehouses are the default cloud platform for analytics and AI, but they become unsafe when untrusted actors concurrently operate on production data: upstream-downstream mismatches surface only at runtime, and multi-table pipelines can leak partial effects. Inspired by software engineering, we design Bauplan, a code-first lakehouse that aims to make (most) illegal states unrepresentable using familiar abstractions. Bauplan acts along three axes: typed table contracts to make pipeline boundaries checkable, Git-like data versioning for review and reproducibility, and transactional runs that guarantee pipeline-level atomicity. We report early results from a lightweight formal transaction model and discuss future work motivated by counterexamples.

### 10. [sVIRGO: A Scalable Virtual Tree Hierarchical Framework for Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02438v1)

Authors: Lican Huang

We propose sVIRGO, a scalable virtual tree hierarchical framework for large-scale distributed systems. sVIRGO constructs virtual hierarchical trees directly on physical nodes, allowing each node to assume multiple hierarchical roles without overlay networks. The hierarchy preserves locality and is organized into configurable layers within regions. Coordination across thousands of regions is achieved via virtual upper-layer roles dynamically mapped onto nodes up to the top layer.
  Each region maintains multiple active coordinators that monitor local health and perform dynamic re-selection if failures occur. Temporary drops below the minimum threshold do not compromise coordination, ensuring near-zero recovery latency, bounded communication overhead, and exponentially reduced failure probability while maintaining safety, liveness, and robustness under mobile, interference-prone, or adversarial conditions.
  Communication is decoupled from the hierarchy and may use multi-frequency wireless links. Two message hop strategies are supported: (i) with long-distance infrastructure-assisted channels, coordinators exploit the virtual tree to minimize hops; (ii) without such channels, messages propagate via adjacent regions.
  sVIRGO also supports Layer-Scoped Command Execution. Commands and coordination actions are executed within the scope of each hierarchical layer, enabling efficient local and regional decision-making while limiting unnecessary global propagation.

Authors: Muneer Ahmad, Undie Felicia Nkatv, Amrita Sharma, Gorrety Maria Juma, Nicholas Kamoga, Julirine Nakanwag

This scientometric study analyzes Avian Influenza research from 2014 to 2023 using bibliographic data from the Web of Science database. We examined publication trends, sources, authorship, collaborative networks, document types, and geographical distribution to gain insights into the global research landscape. Results reveal a steady increase in publications, with high contributions from Chinese and American institutions. Journals such as PLoS One and the Journal of Virology published the highest number of studies, indicating their influence in this field. The most prolific institutions include the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Hong Kong, while the College of Veterinary Medicine at South China Agricultural University emerged as the most productive department. China and the USA lead in publication volume, though developed nations like the United Kingdom and Germany exhibit a higher rate of international collaboration. "Articles" are the most common document type, constituting 84.6% of the total, while "Reviews" account for 7.6%. This study provides a comprehensive view of global trends in Avian Influenza research, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts across borders.

### 2. [Unmediated AI-Assisted Scholarly Citations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01686v1)

Authors: Stefan Szeider

Traditional bibliography databases require users to navigate search forms and manually copy citation data. Language models offer an alternative: a natural-language interface where researchers write text with informal citation fragments, which are automatically resolved to proper references. However, language models are not reliable for scholarly work as they generate fabricated (hallucinated) citations at substantial rates.
  We present an architectural approach that combines the natural-language interface of LLM chatbots with the accuracy of direct database access, implemented through the Model Context Protocol. Our system enables language models to search bibliographic databases, perform fuzzy matching, and export verified entries, all through conversational interaction.
  A key architectural principle bypasses the language model during final data export: entries are fetched directly from authoritative sources, with timeout protection, to guarantee accuracy. We demonstrate this approach with MCP-DBLP, a server providing access to the DBLP computer science bibliography. The system transforms form-based bibliographic services into conversational assistants that maintain scholarly integrity. This architecture is adaptable to other bibliographic databases and academic data sources.

Authors: Caleb McFarland

We introduce the tree-decomposition-based parameter totally $Δ$-modular treewidth (TDM-treewidth) for matrices with two nonzero entries per row. We show how to solve integer programs whose matrices have bounded TDM-treewidth when variables are bounded. This extends previous graph-based decomposition parameters for matrices with at most two nonzero entries per row to include matrices with entries outside of $\{-1,0,1\}$. We also give an analogue of the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for matrices of bounded TDM-treewidth in the language of rooted signed graphs.

### 2. [The price of homogeneity is polynomial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01882v1)

Authors: Maximilian Gorsky, Michał T. Seweryn, Sebastian Wiederrecht

We provide explicit and polynomial bounds for the Homogeneous Wall Lemma which occurred for the first time implicitly in the $13$th entry of Robertson and Seymour's Graph Minors Series [JCTB 1990] and has since become a cornerstone in the algorithmic theory of graph minors.
  A wall where each brick is assigned a set of colours is said to be homogeneous if each brick is assigned the same set of colours. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma says that there exists a function $h$ that, given non-negative integers $q$ and $k$ and an $h(q,k)$-wall $W$ where each brick is assigned a, possibly empty, subset of $\{ 1, \ldots , q \}$ contains a $k$-wall $W'$ as a subgraph such that, if one assigns to each brick $B$ of $W'$ the union of the sets assigned to the bricks of $W$ in its interior, then $W'$ is homogeneous. It is well-known that $h(q,k) \in k^{\mathcal{O}(q)}$. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma plays a key role in most applications of the Irrelevant Vertex Technique where an exponential dependency of $h$ on $q$ usually causes non-uniform dependencies on meta-parameters at best and additional exponential blow-ups at worst. By proving that $h(q,k) \in \mathcal{O}(q^4 \cdot k^6)$, we provide a positive answer to a problem raised by Sau, Stamoulis, and Thilikos [ICALP 2020].

### 3. [A polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing high-bandwidth graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01755v1)

Authors: Luis M. B. Varona

An unweighted, undirected graph $G$ on $n$ nodes is said to have \emph{bandwidth} at most $k$ if its nodes can be labelled from $0$ to $n - 1$ such that no two adjacent nodes have labels that differ by more than $k$. It is known that one can decide whether the bandwidth of $G$ is at most $k$ in $O(n^k)$ time and $O(n^k)$ space using dynamic programming techniques. For small $k$ close to $0$, this approach is effectively polynomial, but as $k$ scales with $n$, it becomes superexponential, requiring up to $O(n^{n - 1})$ time (where $n - 1$ is the maximum possible bandwidth). In this paper, we reformulate the problem in terms of bipartite matching for sufficiently large $k \ge \lfloor (n - 1)/2 \rfloor$, allowing us to use Hall's marriage theorem to develop an algorithm that runs in $O(n^{n - k + 1})$ time and $O(n)$ auxiliary space (beyond storage of the input graph). This yields polynomial complexity for large $k$ close to $n - 1$, demonstrating that the bandwidth recognition problem is solvable in polynomial time whenever either $k$ or $n - k$ remains small.

### 4. [$m$-Eternal Dominating Set Problem on Subclasses of Chordal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02135v1)

Authors: Ashutosh Rai, Soumyashree Rana

A dominating set of a graph G(V, E) is a set of vertices D\subseteq V such that every vertex in V\D has a neighbor in D. An eternal dominating set extends this concept by placing mobile guards on the vertices of D. In response to an infinite sequence of attacks on unoccupied vertices, a guard can move to the attacked vertex from an adjacent position, ensuring that the new guards configuration remains a dominating set. In the one (all) guard(s) move model, only one (multiple) guard(s) moves(may move) per attack. The set of vertices representing the initial configuration of guards in one(all) guard move model is the eternal dominating set (m-eternal dominating set) of G. The minimum size of such a set in one(all) guard move model is called the eternal domination number (m-eternal domination number) of G, respectively. Given a graph G and an integer k, the m-Eternal Dominating Set asks whether G has an m-eternal dominating set of size at most k. In this work, we focus mainly on the computational complexity of m-Eternal Dominating Set in subclasses of chordal graphs. For split graphs, we show a dichotomy result by first designing a polynomial-time algorithm for K1,t-free split graphs with t\le 4, and then proving that the problem becomes NP-complete for t\ge 5. We showed that the problem is NP-hard on undirected path graphs. Moreover, we exhibit the computational complexity difference between the variants by showing the existence of two graph classes such that, in one, both Dominating Set and m-Eternal Dominating Set are solvable in polynomial time while Eternal Dominating Set is NP-hard, whereas in the other, Eternal Dominating Set is solvable in polynomial time and both Dominating Set and m-Eternal Dominating Set are NP-hard. Finally, we present a graph class where Dominating Set is NP-hard, but m-Eternal Dominating Set is efficiently solvable.

### 5. [Sharp Thresholds for Temporal Motifs and Doubling Time in Random Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01847v1)

Authors: Henry Austin, George B. Mertzios, Paul G. Spirakis

In this paper we study two natural models of \textit{random temporal} graphs. In the first, the \textit{continuous} model, each edge $e$ is assigned $l_e$ labels, each drawn uniformly at random from $(0,1]$, where the numbers $l_e$ are independent random variables following the same discrete probability distribution. In the second, the \textit{discrete} model, the $l_e$ labels of each edge $e$ are chosen uniformly at random from a set $\{1,2,\ldots,T\}$. In both models we study the existence of \textit{$δ$-temporal motifs}. Here a $δ$-temporal motif consists of a pair $(H,P)$, where $H$ is a fixed static graph and $P$ is a partial order over its edges. A temporal graph $\mathcal{G}=(G,λ)$ contains $(H,P)$ as a $δ$-temporal motif if $\mathcal{G}$ has a simple temporal subgraph on the edges of $H$ whose time labels are ordered according to $P$, and whose life duration is at most $δ$. We prove \textit{sharp existence thresholds} for all $δ$-temporal motifs, and we identify a qualitatively different behavior from the analogous static thresholds in Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Applying the same techniques, we then characterize the growth of the largest $δ$-temporal clique in the continuous variant of our random temporal graphs model. Finally, we consider the \textit{doubling time} of the reachability ball centered on a small set of vertices of the random temporal graph as a natural proxy for temporal expansion. We prove \textit{sharp upper and lower bounds} for the maximum doubling time in the continuous model.

### 3. [Deciding Reachability and the Covering Problem with Diagnostics for Sound Acyclic Free-Choice Workflow Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02447v1)

Authors: Thomas M. Prinz, Christopher T. Schwanen, Wil M. P. van der Aalst

A central decision problem in Petri net theory is reachability asking whether a given marking can be reached from the initial marking. Related is the covering problem (or sub-marking reachbility), which decides whether there is a reachable marking covering at least the tokens in the given marking. For live and bounded free-choice nets as well as for sound free-choice workflow nets, both problems are polynomial in their computational complexity. This paper refines this complexity for the class of sound acyclic free-choice workflow nets to a quadratic polynomial, more specifically to $O(P^2 + T^2)$. Furthermore, this paper shows the feasibility of accurately explaining why a given marking is or is not reachable. This can be achieved by three new concepts: admissibility, maximum admissibility, and diverging transitions. Admissibility requires that all places in a given marking are pairwise concurrent. Maximum admissibility states that adding a marked place to an admissible marking would make it inadmissible. A diverging transition is a transition which originally "produces" the concurrent tokens that lead to a given marking. In this paper, we provide algorithms for all these concepts and explain their computation in detail by basing them on the concepts of concurrency and post-dominance frontiers - a well known concept from compiler construction. In doing this, we present straight-forward implementations for solving (sub-marking) reachability.

### 4. [Stable Matching with Predictions: Robustness and Efficiency under Pruned Preferences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02254v1)

Authors: Samuel McCauley, Benjamin Moseley, Helia Niaparast, Shikha Singh

In this paper, we study the fundamental problem of finding a stable matching in two-sided matching markets. In the classic variant, it is assumed that both sides of the market submit a ranked list of all agents on the other side. However, in large matching markets such as the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), it is infeasible for hospitals to interview or mutually rank each resident. In this paper, we study the stable matching problem with truncated preference lists. In particular, we assume that, based on historical datasets, each hospital has a predicted rank of its likely match and only ranks residents within a bounded interval around that prediction.
  We use the algorithms-with-predictions framework and show that the classic deferred-acceptance (DA) algorithm used to compute stable matchings is robust to such truncation. We present two algorithms and theoretically and empirically evaluate their performance. Our results show that even with reasonably accurate predictions, it is possible to significantly cut down on both instance size (the length of preference lists) as well as the number of proposals made. These results explain the practical success of the DA algorithm and connect market design to the emerging theory of algorithms with predictions.

### 5. [Finite and Corruption-Robust Regret Bounds in Online Inverse Linear Optimization under M-Convex Action Sets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01682v1)

Authors: Taihei Oki, Shinsaku Sakaue

We study online inverse linear optimization, also known as contextual recommendation, where a learner sequentially infers an agent's hidden objective vector from observed optimal actions over feasible sets that change over time. The learner aims to recommend actions that perform well under the agent's true objective, and the performance is measured by the regret, defined as the cumulative gap between the agent's optimal values and those achieved by the learner's recommended actions. Prior work has established a regret bound of $O(d\log T)$, as well as a finite but exponentially large bound of $\exp(O(d\log d))$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem and $T$ is the time horizon, while a regret lower bound of $Ω(d)$ is known (Gollapudi et al. 2021; Sakaue et al. 2025). Whether a finite regret bound polynomial in $d$ is achievable or not has remained an open question. We partially resolve this by showing that when the feasible sets are M-convex -- a broad class that includes matroids -- a finite regret bound of $O(d\log d)$ is possible. We achieve this by combining a structural characterization of optimal solutions on M-convex sets with a geometric volume argument. Moreover, we extend our approach to adversarially corrupted feedback in up to $C$ rounds. We obtain a regret bound of $O((C+1)d\log d)$ without prior knowledge of $C$, by monitoring directed graphs induced by the observed feedback to detect corruptions adaptively.

Visual social media platforms have become primary venues for political discourse, yet we know little about how moralization operates differently across platforms and topics. Analyzing 2,027,595 TikToks and 1,126,972 Instagram posts during the 2024 US presidential election, we demonstrate that issues are not necessarily inherently moralized, but a product of audience demographics, platform architecture, and partisan framing. Using temporal supply-demand analysis and moral foundations scoring (eMFD), we examine the dynamics of key electoral issues. Three key findings emerge. First, moralization patterns diverge dramatically by platform: TikTok's algorithm enabled viral spread of moralized abortion and immigration content despite lower supply, while Instagram amplified economic discourse that aligned supply and demand. Second, traditionally "pragmatic" economic issues became moralized-cryptocurrency discourse invoked loyalty and authority foundations more strongly than any other topic, framing regulation as government overreach. Third, platforms responded to different events: TikTok surged after Harris's nomination across all topics (96% reduction in supply volatility), while Instagram spiked around cryptocurrency policy developments. Semantic network analysis reveals TikTok's circular topology enables cross-cutting exposure while Instagram's fragmented structure isolates Harris from economic discourse. These findings demonstrate that understanding political moralization requires examining platform-specific ecosystems where architecture, demographics, and content strategy interact to determine which issues get moralized and how moral content spreads.

Authors: Afifah Kashif, Abdul Muhsin Hameed, Asim Iqbal

Current AI governance frameworks, including regulatory benchmarks for accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency, are built for static, centrally trained artificial neural networks on von Neumann hardware. NeuroAI systems, embodied in neuromorphic hardware and implemented via spiking neural networks, break these assumptions. This paper examines the limitations of current AI governance frameworks for NeuroAI, arguing that assurance and audit methods must co-evolve with these architectures, aligning traditional regulatory metrics with the physics, learning dynamics, and embodied efficiency of brain-inspired computation to enable technically grounded assurance.

Authors: Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov, Derya Umut Kulali, Taner Yilmaz, Duygu Erisken, Rana Irem Turhan

Edge AI applications increasingly require ultra-low-power, low-latency inference. Neuromorphic computing based on event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an attractive path, but practical deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by training difficulty, hardware-mapping overheads, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency. A case study on an autonomous-drone workload shows up to 312x energy savings relative to conventional deep neural networks while maintaining real-time operation.

### 1. [Well-Formed Free-Choice Petri Nets Revisited](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02352v1)

Authors: Petr Jancar, Eike Best, Raymond Devillers, Matej Ostadal

The theory of free-choice Petri nets is an established field, initiated in the 1970s by Commoner and Hack at MIT. We revisit well-formed free-choice nets (those admitting markings that are both live and bounded) and provide a new characterization by introducing semi-T-components. This notion is dual to that of semi-S-components, which in turn correspond to the well-known minimal siphons. By highlighting the symmetry between these dual concepts, we derive the classical coverability theorems for T- and S-components, as well as the duality theorem -- stating that a free-choice net is well-formed if and only if its reverse-dual is also well-formed -- using arguments that are as symmetric as possible.

### 2. [Deciding Reachability and the Covering Problem with Diagnostics for Sound Acyclic Free-Choice Workflow Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02447v1)

Authors: Thomas M. Prinz, Christopher T. Schwanen, Wil M. P. van der Aalst

A central decision problem in Petri net theory is reachability asking whether a given marking can be reached from the initial marking. Related is the covering problem (or sub-marking reachbility), which decides whether there is a reachable marking covering at least the tokens in the given marking. For live and bounded free-choice nets as well as for sound free-choice workflow nets, both problems are polynomial in their computational complexity. This paper refines this complexity for the class of sound acyclic free-choice workflow nets to a quadratic polynomial, more specifically to $O(P^2 + T^2)$. Furthermore, this paper shows the feasibility of accurately explaining why a given marking is or is not reachable. This can be achieved by three new concepts: admissibility, maximum admissibility, and diverging transitions. Admissibility requires that all places in a given marking are pairwise concurrent. Maximum admissibility states that adding a marked place to an admissible marking would make it inadmissible. A diverging transition is a transition which originally "produces" the concurrent tokens that lead to a given marking. In this paper, we provide algorithms for all these concepts and explain their computation in detail by basing them on the concepts of concurrency and post-dominance frontiers - a well known concept from compiler construction. In doing this, we present straight-forward implementations for solving (sub-marking) reachability.

Authors: Albert Kwok, Zheyuan Hu, Dounia Hammou

Implicit neural representation (INR) has proven to be accurate and efficient in various domains. In this work, we explore how different neural networks can be designed as a new texture INR, which operates in a continuous manner rather than a discrete one over the input UV coordinate space. Through thorough experiments, we demonstrate that these INRs perform well in terms of image quality, with considerable memory usage and rendering inference time. We analyze the balance between these objectives. In addition, we investigate various related applications in real-time rendering and down-stream tasks, e.g. mipmap fitting and INR-space generation.

### 2. [OFERA: Blendshape-driven 3D Gaussian Control for Occluded Facial Expression to Realistic Avatars in VR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01748v1)

Authors: Seokhwan Yang, Boram Yoon, Seoyoung Kang, Hail Song, Woontack Woo

We propose OFERA, a novel framework for real-time expression control of photorealistic Gaussian head avatars for VR headset users. Existing approaches attempt to recover occluded facial expressions using additional sensors or internal cameras, but sensor-based methods increase device weight and discomfort, while camera-based methods raise privacy concerns and suffer from limited access to raw data. To overcome these limitations, we leverage the blendshape signals provided by commercial VR headsets as expression inputs. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) Blendshape Distribution Alignment (BDA), which applies linear regression to align the headset-provided blendshape distribution to a canonical input space; (2) an Expression Parameter Mapper (EPM) that maps the aligned blendshape signals into an expression parameter space for controlling Gaussian head avatars; and (3) a Mapper-integrated Avatar (MiA) that incorporates EPM into the avatar learning process to ensure distributional consistency. Furthermore, OFERA establishes an end-to-end pipeline that senses and maps expressions, updates Gaussian avatars, and renders them in real-time within VR environments. We show that EPM outperforms existing mapping methods on quantitative metrics, and we demonstrate through a user study that the full OFERA framework enhances expression fidelity while preserving avatar realism. By enabling real-time and photorealistic avatar expression control, OFERA significantly improves telepresence in VR communication.

Authors: Hail Song, Boram Yoon, Seokhwan Yang, Seoyoung Kang, Hyunjeong Kim, Henning Metzmacher, Woontack Woo

We present VRGaussianAvatar, an integrated system that enables real-time full-body 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatars in virtual reality using only head-mounted display (HMD) tracking signals. The system adopts a parallel pipeline with a VR Frontend and a GA Backend. The VR Frontend uses inverse kinematics to estimate full-body pose and streams the resulting pose along with stereo camera parameters to the backend. The GA Backend stereoscopically renders a 3DGS avatar reconstructed from a single image. To improve stereo rendering efficiency, we introduce Binocular Batching, which jointly processes left and right eye views in a single batched pass to reduce redundant computation and support high-resolution VR displays. We evaluate VRGaussianAvatar with quantitative performance tests and a within-subject user study against image- and video-based mesh avatar baselines. Results show that VRGaussianAvatar sustains interactive VR performance and yields higher perceived appearance similarity, embodiment, and plausibility.

Authors: Zhehao Xu, Lok Ming Lui

Spherical surface parameterization is a fundamental tool in geometry processing and imaging science. For a genus-0 closed surface, many efficient algorithms can map the surface to the sphere; consequently, a broad class of task-driven genus-0 mapping problems can be reduced to constructing a high-quality spherical self-map. However, existing approaches often face a trade-off between satisfying task objectives (e.g., landmark or feature alignment), maintaining bijectivity, and controlling geometric distortion. We introduce the Spherical Beltrami Differential (SBD), a two-chart representation of quasiconformal self-maps of the sphere, and establish its correspondence with spherical homeomorphisms up to conformal automorphisms. Building on the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), we propose a neural optimization framework BOOST that optimizes two Beltrami fields on hemispherical stereographic charts and enforces global consistency through explicit seam-aware constraints. Experiments on large-deformation landmark matching and intensity-based spherical registration demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We further apply the method to brain cortical surface registration, aligning sulcal landmarks and jointly matching cortical sulci depth maps, showing improved task fidelity with controlled distortion and robust bijective behavior.

### 1. [Game of Thought: Robust Information Seeking with Large Language Models Using Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01708v1)

Authors: Langyuan Cui, Chun Kai Ling, Hwee Tou Ng

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios where they may lack sufficient information to complete a given task. In such settings, the ability to actively seek out missing information becomes a critical capability. Existing approaches to enhancing this ability often rely on simplifying assumptions that degrade \textit{worst-case} performance. This is an issue with serious implications in high-stakes applications. In this work, we use the game of Twenty Questions to evaluate the information-seeking ability of LLMs. We introduce and formalize its adversarial counterpart, the Strategic Language Search (SLS) problem along with its variants as a two-player zero-sum extensive form game. We propose Game of Thought (GoT), a framework that applies game-theoretic techniques to approximate a Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy for the restricted variant of the game. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves worst-case performance compared to (1) direct prompting-based methods and (2) heuristic-guided search methods across all tested settings.

### 2. [Carry-Over Lottery Allocation: Practical Incentive-Compatible Drafts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02487v1)

Authors: Timothy Highley, Tannah Duncan, Ilia Volkov

The NBA Draft lottery is designed to promote competitive balance by awarding better draft positions to weaker teams, but it creates incentives to deliberately lose, a practice known as tanking. We propose a draft mechanism that is simultaneously practical, incentive-compatible, and advantages weaker teams. The \textbf{Carry-Over Lottery Allocation (COLA) Draft Mechanism} represents a paradigm shift in evaluating team quality, replacing a single season's standings with playoff outcomes over multiple years. COLA uses a draft lottery where every non-playoff team receives the same number of lottery tickets, removing incentives to lose additional games after elimination. Lottery tickets that do not win a top draft pick carry over to future lotteries, while playoff success or winning a top pick diminishes a team's accumulated tickets. Over time, COLA rewards teams with poor long-term performance and less prior draft assistance. By retaining the lottery format, COLA preserves transparency and fan engagement.
  Real-world implementation challenges are addressed to demonstrate feasibility, including transitioning from the current system, handling traded draft picks, and accommodating draft classes of varying strength. The most significant challenge occurs in years with exceptionally strong draft classes, where teams may prefer missing the playoffs in order to gain lottery access, violating a foundational assumption: that teams prefer playoff success to lottery participation. We provide a solution to this problem, employing a truth-elicitation mechanism to identify such years and expand lottery eligibility to include as many playoff teams as necessary to preserve anti-tanking incentives.

### 3. [Fostering Data Collaboration in Digital Transportation Marketplaces: The Role of Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01804v1)

Authors: Qiqing Wang, Haokun Yu, Kaidi Yang

Data collaboration between municipal authorities (MA) and mobility providers (MPs) has brought tremendous benefits to transportation systems in the era of big data. Engaging in collaboration can improve the service operations (e.g., reduced delay) of these data owners, however, it can also raise privacy concerns and discourage data-sharing willingness. Specifically, data owners may be concerned that the shared data may leak sensitive information about their customers' mobility patterns or business secrets, resulting in the failure of collaboration. This paper investigates how privacy-preserving mechanisms can foster data collaboration in such settings. We propose a game-theoretic framework to investigate data-sharing among transportation stakeholders, especially considering perturbation-based privacy-preserving mechanisms. Numerical studies demonstrate that lower data quality expectations can incentivize voluntary data sharing, improving transport-related welfare for both MAs and MPs. Our findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and system designers on how privacy-preserving technologies can help bridge data silos and promote collaborative, privacy-aware transportation systems.

### 4. [Stable Matching with Predictions: Robustness and Efficiency under Pruned Preferences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02254v1)

Authors: Samuel McCauley, Benjamin Moseley, Helia Niaparast, Shikha Singh

In this paper, we study the fundamental problem of finding a stable matching in two-sided matching markets. In the classic variant, it is assumed that both sides of the market submit a ranked list of all agents on the other side. However, in large matching markets such as the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), it is infeasible for hospitals to interview or mutually rank each resident. In this paper, we study the stable matching problem with truncated preference lists. In particular, we assume that, based on historical datasets, each hospital has a predicted rank of its likely match and only ranks residents within a bounded interval around that prediction.
  We use the algorithms-with-predictions framework and show that the classic deferred-acceptance (DA) algorithm used to compute stable matchings is robust to such truncation. We present two algorithms and theoretically and empirically evaluate their performance. Our results show that even with reasonably accurate predictions, it is possible to significantly cut down on both instance size (the length of preference lists) as well as the number of proposals made. These results explain the practical success of the DA algorithm and connect market design to the emerging theory of algorithms with predictions.

Authors: Hamzah Khan, Dong Ho Lee, Jingqi Li, Tianyu Qiu, Christian Ellis, Jesse Milzman, Wesley Suttle, David Fridovich-Keil

Multi-robot coordination often exhibits hierarchical structure, with some robots' decisions depending on the planned behaviors of others. While game theory provides a principled framework for such interactions, existing solvers struggle to handle mixed information structures that combine simultaneous (Nash) and hierarchical (Stackelberg) decision-making. We study N-robot forest-structured mixed-hierarchy games, in which each robot acts as a Stackelberg leader over its subtree while robots in different branches interact via Nash equilibria. We derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) first-order optimality conditions for this class of games and show that they involve increasingly high-order derivatives of robots' best-response policies as the hierarchy depth grows, rendering a direct solution intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a quasi-policy approximation that removes higher-order policy derivatives and develop an inexact Newton method for efficiently solving the resulting approximated KKT systems. We prove local exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm for games with non-quadratic objectives and nonlinear constraints. The approach is implemented in a highly optimized Julia library (MixedHierarchyGames.jl) and evaluated in simulated experiments, demonstrating real-time convergence for complex mixed-hierarchy information structures.

Authors: Fabio Stano, Max L Wilson, Christof Weinhardt, Michael T Knierim

In digital knowledge work, flow promises not just productivity; it offers a pathway to well-being. Yet despite decades of flow research in HCI, we know little about how to design digital interventions that support it. In this work, we foreground lived interventions - everyday practices workers already use to foster flow - to uncover overlooked opportunities and chart new directions for digital intervention design. Specifically, we report findings from two studies: (1) a reflexive thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses (n = 160), surfacing 38 lived interventions across four categories: environment, organization, task shaping, and personal readiness; and (2) a quantitative online survey (n = 121) that validates this repertoire, identifies which interventions are broadly endorsed versus polarizing, and elicits visions of technological support. We contribute empirical insights into how digital workers cultivate flow, situate these lived interventions within existing literature, and derive design opportunities for future digital flow interventions.

Authors: Ezequiel Lopez-Lopez, Christoph M. Abels, Philipp Lorenz-Spreen, Stephan Lewandowsky, Stefan M. Herzog

People navigate complex environments using cues, heuristics, and other strategies, which are often adaptive in stable settings. However, as AI increasingly permeates society's information environments, those become more adaptive and evolving: LLM-based chatbots participate in extended interaction, maintain conversational histories, mirror social cues, and can hypercustomize responses, thereby shaping not only what information is accessed but how questions are framed, how evidence is interpreted, and when action feels warranted. Here we propose a framework for sustained human-AI interaction that rests on invariant features of human cognition and human--AI interaction and centers on three interlinked phenomena: entanglement between users and AI systems, the emergence of cognitive and behavioral drift over repeated interactions, and the role of metacognition in the awareness and regulation of these dynamics. As conversational agents provide cues (e.g., fluency, coherence, responsiveness) that people treat as informative, subjective confidence and action readiness may increase without corresponding gains in epistemic reliability, making drift difficult to detect and correct. We describe these dynamics across micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. The framework identifies four metacognitive intervention points and psychologically informed interventions that provide metacognitive scaffolding (boosting and self-nudging). Finally, we outline a long-horizon research agenda for scientific foresight.

Authors: Alessandro Silacci, Mauro Cherubini, Arianna Boldi, Amon Rapp, Maurizio Caon

Physical inactivity remains a critical global health issue, yet scalable strategies for sustained motivation are scarce. Conversational agents designed as simulated exercising peers (SEPs) represent a promising alternative, but their long-term impact is unclear. We report a six-month randomized controlled trial (N=280) comparing individuals exercising alone, with a human peer, or with a large language model-driven SEP. Results revealed a partnership paradox: human peers evoked stronger social presence, while AI peers provided steadier encouragement and more reliable working alliances. Humans motivated through authentic comparison and accountability, whereas AI peers fostered consistent, low-stakes support. These complementary strengths suggest that AI agents should not mimic human authenticity but augment it with reliability. Our findings advance human-agent interaction research and point to hybrid designs where human presence and AI consistency jointly sustain physical activity.

Authors: Daniel Mwesigwa, Steven J. Jackson, Christopher Csikszentmihalyi

Credit scoring is an increasingly central and contested domain of data and AI governance, frequently framed as a neutral and objective method of assessing risk across diverse economic and political contexts. Based on a nine-month ethnography of credit scoring practices in Nairobi, Kenya, we examined the sociotechnical and institutional work of data science in digital lending. While established regional telcos and banks are leveraging proprietary data to develop digital loan products, algorithmic credit scoring is being transformed by new actors, techniques, and shifting regulations. Our findings show how practitioners construct alternative data using technical and legal workarounds, formulate risk through multiple interpretations, and negotiate model performance via technical and political means. We argue that algorithmic credit scoring is accomplished through the ongoing work of alignment that stabilizes risk under conditions of persistent uncertainty, taking epistemic, modeling, and contextual forms. Extending work on alignment in HCI, we show how it operates as a two-way translation, where models are made "safe for worlds" while those worlds are reshaped to be "safe for models."

Authors: Jingyue Zhang, J. D. Zamfirescu-Pereira, Elena L. Glassman, Damien Masson, Ian Arawjo

Traditional human-computer interaction takes place through formally-specified systems like structured UIs and programming languages. Recent AI systems promise a new set of informal interactions with computers through natural language and other notational forms. These informal interactions can then lead to formal representations, but depend upon pre-existing formalisms known to both humans and AI. What about novel formalisms and notations? How are new abstractions created, evolved, and incrementally formalized over time -- and how might new systems, in turn, be explicitly designed to support these processes? We conduct a comparative historical analysis of notation development to identify some relevant characteristics. These include three social stages of notation development: invention & incubation, dispersion & divergence, and institutionalization & sanctification, as well as three functional stages: descriptive, generative, and evaluative. Within and across these stages, we detail several patterns, such as the role of linking and grounding metaphors, dimensions of meaningful variation, and analogical alignment. Finally, we offer some implications for design.

Authors: ATM Mizanur Rahman, Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, Sharifa Sultana

This paper investigates data repair practices through a six-month-long ethnographic study in Bangladesh. Our interviews and field observations with data repairers and related stakeholders found that, alongside the scarcity of high-precision machinery and access to advanced software, data repair work is constrained by cross-language learning resources and the protective nature of documenting, curating, and sharing the experiences and knowledge among local peers. Repairers turning to external resources such as foreign forums and LLMs also revealed their frustrating experiences and the postcolonial ethical tensions they encountered. We noted that both anticipated technical labor and the emotionality of data were taken into account for pricing the data repair job, which contributed to their market sustainability strategies. Engaging with repair, infrastructure, and data poverty discourse, we argue that data repair practices represent a crucial challenge and opportunity for HCI in advancing global efforts toward data equity.

Authors: Julian Berger, Pantelis P. Analytis, Frederik Andersen, Kristian P. Lorenzen, Ville Satopää, Ralf HJM Kurvers

Combining human and artificial intelligence (AI) is a potentially powerful approach to boost decision accuracy. However, few such approaches exist that effectively integrate both types of intelligence while maintaining human agency. Here, we introduce and evaluate the hybrid confirmation tree, a simple aggregation strategy that compares the independent decisions of both a human and AI, with disagreements triggering a second human tiebreaker. Through analytical derivations, we show that the hybrid confirmation tree can match and exceed the accuracy of a three-person human majority vote while requiring fewer human inputs, particularly when AI accuracy is comparable to or exceeds human accuracy. We analytically demonstrate that the hybrid confirmation tree's ability to achieve complementarity -- outperforming individual humans, AI, and the majority vote -- is maximized when human and AI accuracies are similar and their decisions are not overly correlated. Empirical reanalysis of six real-world datasets (covering skin cancer diagnosis, deepfake detection, geopolitical forecasting, and criminal rearrest) validates these findings, showing that the hybrid confirmation tree improves accuracy over the majority vote by up to 10 percentage points while reducing the cost of decision making by 28--44$\%$. Furthermore, the hybrid confirmation tree provides greater flexibility in navigating true and false positive trade-offs compared to fixed human-only heuristics like hierarchies and polyarchies. The hybrid confirmation tree emerges as a practical, efficient, and robust strategy for hybrid collective intelligence that maintains human agency.

Authors: Ningjing Tang, Alice Qian, Qiaosi Wang, Esther Howe, Blake Bullwinkel, Paola Pedrelli, Jina Suh, Hoda Heidari, Hong Shen

Content Warning: This paper contains participant quotes and discussions related to mental health challenges, emotional distress, and suicidal ideation.
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for mental health support, yet the model safeguards -- particularly refusals to engage with sensitive content -- remain poorly understood from the perspectives of users and mental health professionals (MHPs) and have been reported to cause real-world harms. This paper presents findings from a sequential mixed-methods study examining how LLM refusals are experienced and interpreted in mental health support interactions. Through surveys (N=53) and in-depth interviews (N=16) with individuals using LLMs for mental health support and MHPs, we reveal that refusals are not isolated, single-turn system behaviors, but rather constitute dynamic, multi-phase experiences: pre-refusal expectation formation, refusal triggering and encounter, refusal message framing, resource referral provision, and post-refusal outcomes. We contribute a multi-phase framework for evaluating refusals beyond binary policy compliance accuracy and design recommendations for future refusal mechanisms. These findings suggest that understanding LLM refusals requires moving beyond single-turn interactions toward recognizing them as holistic experiential processes embedded within the entire LLM design pipeline and the broader realities of mental health access.

Authors: Chuyang Zhang, Bin Yu, Yuchao Wang, Mansi Yuan, Wanqi Wang, Seungwoo Je, Pengcheng An

To overcome the lack of deep personalization in standard biofeedback methods, we introduce ASafePlace, a system utilizing an AI-powered, art-therapy-inspired exercise called The Safe Place, to create a personalized VR biofeedback experience. In our system, users sketch a personal sanctuary from memory, which is then transformed into a customized 360 virtual environment with personalized audio guidance for relaxation training. A study with 52 participants showed this approach effectively reduced anxiety and increased user presence, while the integration of art-therapy-inspired activity and biofeedback produced strong improvements in physiological relaxation, measured by heart rate variability and respiration rate. Qualitative results showed how participants' sense of familiarity and presence was enhanced by the symbolic elements and natural sanctuaries created from their autobiographical memories. Our findings demonstrate that art-therapy-inspired activity is a powerful tool for creating highly effective and individualized relaxation experiences, naturally connecting the virtual environment to a user's core memories and emotions.

Authors: Thomas Langerak, Renate Zhang, Ziyuan Wang, Per Ola Kristensson, Antti Oulasvirta

Deciding which idea is worth prototyping is a central concern in iterative design. A prototype should be produced when the expected improvement is high and the cost is low. However, this is hard to decide, because costs can vary drastically: a simple parameter tweak may take seconds, while fabricating hardware consumes material and energy. Such asymmetries, can discourage a designer from exploring the design space. In this paper, we present an extension of cost-aware Bayesian optimization to account for diverse prototyping costs. The method builds on the power of Bayesian optimization and requires only a minimal modification to the acquisition function. The key idea is to use designer-estimated costs to guide sampling toward more cost-effective prototypes. In technical evaluations, the method achieved comparable utility to a cost-agnostic baseline while requiring only ${\approx}70\%$ of the cost; under strict budgets, it outperformed the baseline threefold. A within-subjects study with 12 participants in a realistic joystick design task demonstrated similar benefits. These results show that accounting for prototyping costs can make Bayesian optimization more compatible with real-world design projects.

### Information Retrieval

### 1. [Rethinking Generative Recommender Tokenizer: Recsys-Native Encoding and Semantic Quantization Beyond LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02338v1)

Authors: Yu Liang, Zhongjin Zhang, Yuxuan Zhu, Kerui Zhang, Zhiluohan Guo, Wenhang Zhou, Zonqi Yang, Kangle Wu, Yabo Ni, Anxiang Zeng, Cong Fu, Jianxin Wang, Jiazhi Xia

Semantic ID (SID)-based recommendation is a promising paradigm for scaling sequential recommender systems, but existing methods largely follow a semantic-centric pipeline: item embeddings are learned from foundation models and discretized using generic quantization schemes. This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x. Code is available at https://github.com/FuCongResearchSquad/ReSID.

This scientometric study analyzes Avian Influenza research from 2014 to 2023 using bibliographic data from the Web of Science database. We examined publication trends, sources, authorship, collaborative networks, document types, and geographical distribution to gain insights into the global research landscape. Results reveal a steady increase in publications, with high contributions from Chinese and American institutions. Journals such as PLoS One and the Journal of Virology published the highest number of studies, indicating their influence in this field. The most prolific institutions include the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Hong Kong, while the College of Veterinary Medicine at South China Agricultural University emerged as the most productive department. China and the USA lead in publication volume, though developed nations like the United Kingdom and Germany exhibit a higher rate of international collaboration. "Articles" are the most common document type, constituting 84.6% of the total, while "Reviews" account for 7.6%. This study provides a comprehensive view of global trends in Avian Influenza research, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts across borders.

### 3. [Adaptive Quality-Diversity Trade-offs for Large-Scale Batch Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02024v1)

Authors: Clémence Réda, Tomas Rigaux, Hiba Bederina, Koh Takeuchi, Hisashi Kashima, Jill-Jênn Vie

A core research question in recommender systems is to propose batches of highly relevant and diverse items, that is, items personalized to the user's preferences, but which also might get the user out of their comfort zone. This diversity might induce properties of serendipidity and novelty which might increase user engagement or revenue. However, many real-life problems arise in that case: e.g., avoiding to recommend distinct but too similar items to reduce the churn risk, and computational cost for large item libraries, up to millions of items. First, we consider the case when the user feedback model is perfectly observed and known in advance, and introduce an efficient algorithm called B-DivRec combining determinantal point processes and a fuzzy denuding procedure to adjust the degree of item diversity. This helps enforcing a quality-diversity trade-off throughout the user history. Second, we propose an approach to adaptively tailor the quality-diversity trade-off to the user, so that diversity in recommendations can be enhanced if it leads to positive feedback, and vice-versa. Finally, we illustrate the performance and versatility of B-DivRec in the two settings on synthetic and real-life data sets on movie recommendation and drug repurposing.

Authors: Mika Okamoto, Ansel Kaplan Erol, Glenn Matlin

How should Large Language Model (LLM) practitioners select the right model for a task without wasting money? We introduce BELLA (Budget-Efficient LLM Selection via Automated skill-profiling), a framework that recommends optimal LLM selection for tasks through interpretable skill-based model selection. Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack. We describe the framework architecture, situate it within the landscape of LLM routing and evaluation, and discuss its application to financial reasoning as a representative domain exhibiting diverse skill requirements and cost-variation across models. Our framework enables practitioners to make principled and cost-performance trade-offs for deploying LLMs.

### 5. [Unmediated AI-Assisted Scholarly Citations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01686v1)

Authors: Stefan Szeider

Traditional bibliography databases require users to navigate search forms and manually copy citation data. Language models offer an alternative: a natural-language interface where researchers write text with informal citation fragments, which are automatically resolved to proper references. However, language models are not reliable for scholarly work as they generate fabricated (hallucinated) citations at substantial rates.
  We present an architectural approach that combines the natural-language interface of LLM chatbots with the accuracy of direct database access, implemented through the Model Context Protocol. Our system enables language models to search bibliographic databases, perform fuzzy matching, and export verified entries, all through conversational interaction.
  A key architectural principle bypasses the language model during final data export: entries are fetched directly from authoritative sources, with timeout protection, to guarantee accuracy. We demonstrate this approach with MCP-DBLP, a server providing access to the DBLP computer science bibliography. The system transforms form-based bibliographic services into conversational assistants that maintain scholarly integrity. This architecture is adaptable to other bibliographic databases and academic data sources.

Authors: Tyler Skow, Alexander Martin, Benjamin Van Durme, Rama Chellappa, Reno Kriz

Reranking is a critical component of modern retrieval systems, which typically pair an efficient first-stage retriever with a more expressive model to refine results. While large reasoning models have driven rapid progress in text-centric reranking, reasoning-based reranking for video retrieval remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce RANKVIDEO, a reasoning-based reranker for video retrieval that explicitly reasons over query-video pairs using video content to assess relevance. RANKVIDEO is trained using a two-stage curriculum consisting of perception-grounded supervised fine-tuning followed by reranking training that combines pointwise, pairwise, and teacher confidence distillation objectives, and is supported by a data synthesis pipeline for constructing reasoning-intensive query-video pairs. Experiments on the large-scale MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark demonstrate that RANKVIDEO consistently improves retrieval performance within a two-stage framework, yielding an average improvement of 31% on nDCG@10 and outperforming text-only and vision-language reranking alternatives, while more efficient.

Authors: Shaopeng Chen, Chuyue Xie, Huimin Ren, Shaozong Zhang, Han Zhang, Ruobing Cheng, Zhiqiang Cao, Zehao Ju, Gao Yu, Jie Ding, Xiaodong Chen, Xuewu Jiao, Shuanglong Li, Liu Lin

Traditional Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) face increasing bottlenecks in performance and efficiency, often struggling with generalization and long-sequence modeling. Inspired by the scaling success of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose Generative Ranking for Ads at Baidu (GRAB), an end-to-end generative framework for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. GRAB integrates a novel Causal Action-aware Multi-channel Attention (CamA) mechanism to effectively capture temporal dynamics and specific action signals within user behavior sequences. Full-scale online deployment demonstrates that GRAB significantly outperforms established DLRMs, delivering a 3.05% increase in revenue and a 3.49% rise in CTR. Furthermore, the model demonstrates desirable scaling behavior: its expressive power shows a monotonic and approximately linear improvement as longer interaction sequences are utilized.

Authors: Sidi Wu, Yizi Chen, Maurizio Gribaudi, Konrad Schindler, Clément Mallet, Julien Perret, Lorenz Hurni

Prior to modern Earth observation technologies, historical maps provide a unique record of long-term urban transformation and offer a lens on the evolving identity of cities. However, extracting consistent and fine-grained change information from historical map series remains challenging due to spatial misalignment, cartographic variation, and degrading document quality, limiting most analyses to small-scale or qualitative approaches. We propose a fully automated, deep learning-based framework for fine-grained urban change analysis from large collections of historical maps, built on a modular design that integrates dense map alignment, multi-temporal object detection, and change profiling. This framework shifts the analysis of historical maps from ad hoc visual comparison toward systematic, quantitative characterization of urban change. Experiments demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed alignment and object detection methods. Applied to Paris between 1868 and 1937, the framework reveals the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in urban transformation, highlighting its relevance for research in the social sciences and humanities. The modular design of our framework further supports adaptation to diverse cartographic contexts and downstream applications.

### 9. [LLM-based Embeddings: Attention Values Encode Sentence Semantics Better Than Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01572v1)

Authors: Yeqin Zhang, Yunfei Wang, Jiaxuan Chen, Ke Qin, Yizheng Zhao, Cam-Tu Nguyen

Sentence representations are foundational to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. While recent methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive sentence representations, most rely on final-layer hidden states, which are optimized for next-token prediction and thus often fail to capture global, sentence-level semantics. This paper introduces a novel perspective, demonstrating that attention value vectors capture sentence semantics more effectively than hidden states. We propose Value Aggregation (VA), a simple method that pools token values across multiple layers and token indices. In a training-free setting, VA outperforms other LLM-based embeddings, even matches or surpasses the ensemble-based MetaEOL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when paired with suitable prompts, the layer attention outputs can be interpreted as aligned weighted value vectors. Specifically, the attention scores of the last token function as the weights, while the output projection matrix ($W_O$) aligns these weighted value vectors with the common space of the LLM residual stream. This refined method, termed Aligned Weighted VA (AlignedWVA), achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free LLM-based embeddings, outperforming the high-cost MetaEOL by a substantial margin. Finally, we highlight the potential of obtaining strong LLM embedding models through fine-tuning Value Aggregation.

### 10. [Orthogonal Hierarchical Decomposition for Structure-Aware Table Understanding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01969v1)

Authors: Bin Cao, Huixian Lu, Chenwen Ma, Ting Wang, Ruizhe Li, Jing Fan

Complex tables with multi-level headers, merged cells and heterogeneous layouts pose persistent challenges for LLMs in both understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches typically rely on table linearization or normalized grid modeling. However, these representations struggle to explicitly capture hierarchical structures and cross-dimensional dependencies, which can lead to misalignment between structural semantics and textual representations for non-standard tables. To address this issue, we propose an Orthogonal Hierarchical Decomposition (OHD) framework that constructs structure-preserving input representations of complex tables for LLMs. OHD introduces an Orthogonal Tree Induction (OTI) method based on spatial--semantic co-constraints, which decomposes irregular tables into a column tree and a row tree to capture vertical and horizontal hierarchical dependencies, respectively. Building on this representation, we design a dual-pathway association protocol to symmetrically reconstruct semantic lineage of each cell, and incorporate an LLM as a semantic arbitrator to align multi-level semantic information. We evaluate OHD framework on two complex table question answering benchmarks, AITQA and HiTab. Experimental results show that OHD consistently outperforms existing representation paradigms across multiple evaluation metrics.

### 1. [FiLoRA: Focus-and-Ignore LoRA for Controllable Feature Reliance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02060v1)

Authors: Hyunsuk Chung, Caren Han, Yerin Choi, Seungyeon Ji, Jinwoo Kim, Eun-Jung Holden, Kyungreem Han

Multimodal foundation models integrate heterogeneous signals across modalities, yet it remains poorly understood how their predictions depend on specific internal feature groups and whether such reliance can be deliberately controlled. Existing studies of shortcut and spurious behavior largely rely on post hoc analyses or feature removal, offering limited insight into whether reliance can be modulated without altering task semantics. We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions. Across text--image and audio--visual benchmarks, we show that instruction-conditioned gating induces consistent and causal shifts in internal computation, selectively amplifying or suppressing core and spurious feature groups without modifying the label space or training objective. Further analyses demonstrate that FiLoRA yields improved robustness under spurious feature interventions, revealing a principled mechanism to regulate reliance beyond correlation-driven learning.

### 2. [Ultrafast On-chip Online Learning via Spline Locality in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02056v1)

Authors: Duc Hoang, Aarush Gupta, Philip Harris

Ultrafast online learning is essential for high-frequency systems, such as controls for quantum computing and nuclear fusion, where adaptation must occur on sub-microsecond timescales. Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate model-free online learning at sub-microsecond latencies.

### 3. [Bandwidth-Efficient Multi-Agent Communication through Information Bottleneck and Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02035v1)

Authors: Ahmad Farooq, Kamran Iqbal

Multi-agent reinforcement learning systems deployed in real-world robotics applications face severe communication constraints that significantly impact coordination effectiveness. We present a framework that combines information bottleneck theory with vector quantization to enable selective, bandwidth-efficient communication in multi-agent environments. Our approach learns to compress and discretize communication messages while preserving task-critical information through principled information-theoretic optimization. We introduce a gated communication mechanism that dynamically determines when communication is necessary based on environmental context and agent states. Experimental evaluation on challenging coordination tasks demonstrates that our method achieves 181.8% performance improvement over no-communication baselines while reducing bandwidth usage by 41.4%. Comprehensive Pareto frontier analysis shows dominance across the entire success-bandwidth spectrum with area-under-curve of 0.198 vs 0.142 for next-best methods. Our approach significantly outperforms existing communication strategies and establishes a theoretically grounded framework for deploying multi-agent systems in bandwidth-constrained environments such as robotic swarms, autonomous vehicle fleets, and distributed sensor networks.

### 4. [Robust Domain Generalization under Divergent Marginal and Conditional Distributions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02015v1)

Authors: Jewon Yeom, Kyubyung Chae, Hyunggyu Lim, Yoonna Oh, Dongyoon Yang, Taesup Kim

Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn predictive models that can generalize to unseen domains. Most existing DG approaches focus on learning domain-invariant representations under the assumption of conditional distribution shift (i.e., primarily addressing changes in $P(X\mid Y)$ while assuming $P(Y)$ remains stable). However, real-world scenarios with multiple domains often involve compound distribution shifts where both the marginal label distribution $P(Y)$ and the conditional distribution $P(X\mid Y)$ vary simultaneously. To address this, we propose a unified framework for robust domain generalization under divergent marginal and conditional distributions. We derive a novel risk bound for unseen domains by explicitly decomposing the joint distribution into marginal and conditional components and characterizing risk gaps arising from both sources of divergence. To operationalize this bound, we design a meta-learning procedure that minimizes and validates the proposed risk bound across seen domains, ensuring strong generalization to unseen ones. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on conventional DG benchmarks but also in challenging multi-domain long-tailed recognition settings where both marginal and conditional shifts are pronounced.

### 5. [Self-Consolidation for Self-Evolving Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01966v1)

Authors: Hongzhuo Yu, Fei Zhu, Guo-Sen Xie, Ling Shao

While large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive problem-solving capabilities, they typically operate as static systems, lacking the ability to evolve through lifelong interaction. Existing attempts to bridge this gap primarily rely on retrieving successful past trajectories as demonstrations. However, this paradigm faces two critical limitations. First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters. This enables the agent to internalize extensive historical experience directly into its latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method in long-term agent evolution.

### 6. [Boundary-Constrained Diffusion Models for Floorplan Generation: Balancing Realism and Diversity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01949v1)

Authors: Leonardo Stoppani, Davide Bacciu, Shahab Mokarizadeh

Diffusion models have become widely popular for automated floorplan generation, producing highly realistic layouts conditioned on user-defined constraints. However, optimizing for perceptual metrics such as the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) causes limited design diversity. To address this, we propose the Diversity Score (DS), a metric that quantifies layout diversity under fixed constraints. Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity. Out-Of-Distribution evaluations further demonstrate the models' reliance on dataset priors, emphasizing the need for generative systems that explicitly balance fidelity, diversity, and generalization in architectural design tasks.

Authors: Abdul Joseph Fofanah, Lian Wen, David Chen

Accurate traffic flow prediction remains a fundamental challenge in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in cross-domain, data-scarce scenarios where limited historical data hinders model training and generalisation. The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/afofanah/MCPST.

### 8. [COLT: Lightweight Multi-LLM Collaboration through Shared MCTS Reasoning for Model Compilation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01935v1)

Authors: Annabelle Sujun Tang, Christopher Priebe, Lianhui Qin, Hadi Esmaeilzadeh

Model serving costs dominate AI systems, making compiler optimization essential for scalable deployment. Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models.

### 9. [Embedding Learning on Multiplex Networks for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01922v1)

Authors: Orell Trautmann, Olaf Wolkenhauer, Clémence Réda

Over the past years, embedding learning on networks has shown tremendous results in link prediction tasks for complex systems, with a wide range of real-life applications. Learning a representation for each node in a knowledge graph allows us to capture topological and semantic information, which can be processed in downstream analyses later. In the link prediction task, high-dimensional network information is encoded into low-dimensional vectors, which are then fed to a predictor to infer new connections between nodes in the network. As the network complexity (that is, the numbers of connections and types of interactions) grows, embedding learning turns out increasingly challenging. This review covers published models on embedding learning on multiplex networks for link prediction. First, we propose refined taxonomies to classify and compare models, depending on the type of embeddings and embedding techniques. Second, we review and address the problem of reproducible and fair evaluation of embedding learning on multiplex networks for the link prediction task. Finally, we tackle evaluation on directed multiplex networks by proposing a novel and fair testing procedure. This review constitutes a crucial step towards the development of more performant and tractable embedding learning approaches for multiplex networks and their fair evaluation for the link prediction task. We also suggest guidelines on the evaluation of models, and provide an informed perspective on the challenges and tools currently available to address downstream analyses applied to multiplex networks.

### 10. [Propagating the prior from far to near offset: A self-supervised diffusion framework for progressively recovering near-offsets of towed-streamer data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01909v1)

Authors: Shijun Cheng, Tariq Alkhalifah

In marine towed-streamer seismic acquisition, the nearest hydrophone is often two hundred meter away from the source resulting in missing near-offset traces, which degrades critical processing workflows such as surface-related multiple elimination, velocity analysis, and full-waveform inversion. Existing reconstruction methods, like transform-domain interpolation, often produce kinematic inconsistencies and amplitude distortions, while supervised deep learning approaches require complete ground-truth near-offset data that are unavailable in realistic acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised diffusion-based framework that reconstructs missing near-offset traces without requiring near-offset reference data. Our method leverages overlapping patch extraction with single-trace shifts from the available far-offset section to train a conditional diffusion model, which learns offset-dependent statistical patterns governing event curvature, amplitude variation, and wavelet characteristics. At inference, we perform trace-by-trace recursive extrapolation from the nearest recorded offset toward zero offset, progressively propagating learned prior information from far to near offsets. The generative formulation further provides uncertainty estimates via ensemble sampling, quantifying prediction confidence where validation data are absent. Controlled validation experiments on synthetic and field datasets show substantial performance gains over conventional parabolic Radon transform baselines. Operational deployment on actual near-offset gaps demonstrates practical viability where ground-truth validation is impossible. Notably, the reconstructed waveforms preserve realistic amplitude-versus-offset trends despite training exclusively on far-offset observations, and uncertainty maps accurately identify challenging extrapolation regions.

### 1. [Spark: Modular Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02306v1)

Authors: Mario Franco, Carlos Gershenson

Nowadays, neural networks act as a synonym for artificial intelligence. Present neural network models, although remarkably powerful, are inefficient both in terms of data and energy. Several alternative forms of neural networks have been proposed to address some of these problems. Specifically, spiking neural networks are suitable for efficient hardware implementations. However, effective learning algorithms for spiking networks remain elusive, although it is suspected that effective plasticity mechanisms could alleviate the problem of data efficiency. Here, we present a new framework for spiking neural networks - Spark - built upon the idea of modular design, from simple components to entire models. The aim of this framework is to provide an efficient and streamlined pipeline for spiking neural networks. We showcase this framework by solving the sparse-reward cartpole problem with simple plasticity mechanisms. We hope that a framework compatible with traditional ML pipelines may accelerate research in the area, specifically for continuous and unbatched learning, akin to the one animals exhibit.

Authors: Jens Egholm Pedersen, Tony Lindeberg, Peter Gerstoft

We establish a theoretical connection between wavelet transforms and spiking neural networks through scale-space theory. We rely on the scale-covariant guarantees in the leaky integrate-and-fire neurons to implement discrete mother wavelets that approximate continuous wavelets. A reconstruction experiment demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and warrants further analysis to mitigate current approximation errors. Our work suggests a novel spiking signal representation that could enable more energy-efficient signal processing algorithms.

### 3. [SpikingGamma: Surrogate-Gradient Free and Temporally Precise Online Training of Spiking Neural Networks with Smoothed Delays](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01978v1)

Authors: Roel Koopman, Sebastian Otte, Sander Bohté

Neuromorphic hardware implementations of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient, low-latency AI through sparse, event-driven computation. Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge, hindering both low-latency responsiveness and the mapping of software-trained SNNs to efficient hardware. In current approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state over time, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. These methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations often exhibit instability for long sequences and tend to fail at capturing temporal patterns precisely. To address these limitations, we develop spiking neurons with internal recursive memory structures that we combine with sigma-delta spike-coding. We show that this SpikingGamma model supports direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks and benchmarks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal resolution of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware.

### 4. [Introns and Templates Matter: Rethinking Linkage in GP-GOMEA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02311v1)

Authors: Johannes Koch, Tanja Alderliesten, Peter A. N. Bosman

GP-GOMEA is among the state-of-the-art for symbolic regression, especially when it comes to finding small and potentially interpretable solutions. A key mechanism employed in any GOMEA variant is the exploitation of linkage, the dependencies between variables, to ensure efficient evolution. In GP-GOMEA, mutual information between node positions in GP trees has so far been used to learn linkage. For this, a fixed expression template is used. This however leads to introns for expressions smaller than the full template. As introns have no impact on fitness, their occurrences are not directly linked to selection. Consequently, introns can adversely affect the extent to which mutual information captures dependencies between tree nodes. To overcome this, we propose two new measures for linkage learning, one that explicitly considers introns in mutual information estimates, and one that revisits linkage learning in GP-GOMEA from a grey-box perspective, yielding a measure that needs not to be learned from the population but is derived directly from the template. Across five standard symbolic regression problems, GP-GOMEA achieves substantial improvements using both measures. We also find that the newly learned linkage structure closely reflects the template linkage structure, and that explicitly using the template structure yields the best performance overall.

Authors: Julian Lemmel, Felix Resch, Mónika Farsang, Ramin Hasani, Daniela Rus, Radu Grosu

Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.

### 6. [Enhancing Generalization in Evolutionary Feature Construction for Symbolic Regression through Vicinal Jensen Gap Minimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01510v1)

Authors: Hengzhe Zhang, Qi Chen, Bing Xue, Wolfgang Banzhaf, Mengjie Zhang

Genetic programming-based feature construction has achieved significant success in recent years as an automated machine learning technique to enhance learning performance. However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusion-where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifold-we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures. Comparisons with 15 machine learning algorithms further indicate that genetic programming with the proposed overfitting control strategy achieves superior performance.

### 7. [Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computing for Edge AI: A Framework with Adaptive Spiking Neural Networks and Hardware-Aware Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02439v1)

Authors: Olaf Yunus Laitinen Imanov, Derya Umut Kulali, Taner Yilmaz, Duygu Erisken, Rana Irem Turhan

Edge AI applications increasingly require ultra-low-power, low-latency inference. Neuromorphic computing based on event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs) offers an attractive path, but practical deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by training difficulty, hardware-mapping overheads, and sensitivity to temporal dynamics. We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency. A case study on an autonomous-drone workload shows up to 312x energy savings relative to conventional deep neural networks while maintaining real-time operation.

### 8. [Backpropagation as Physical Relaxation: Exact Gradients in Finite Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02281v1)

Authors: Antonino Emanuele Scurria

Backpropagation, the foundational algorithm for training neural networks, is typically understood as a symbolic computation that recursively applies the chain rule. We show it emerges exactly as the finite-time relaxation of a physical dynamical system. By formulating feedforward inference as a continuous-time process and applying Lagrangian theory of non-conservative systems to handle asymmetric interactions, we derive a global energy functional on a doubled state space encoding both activations and sensitivities. The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native.

### 1. [Preemptive Scheduling for Age of Job Minimization in Task-Specific Machine Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02435v1)

Authors: Subhankar Banerjee, Sennur Ulukus

We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system consisting of a central server, $N$ task-specific networks of machines, and multiple users. Each network specializes in executing a distinct type of task. Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes.

Acoustic data transmission offers a compelling alternative to Bluetooth and NFC by leveraging the ubiquitous speakers and microphones in smartphones and IoT devices. However, most research in this field relies on simulations or limited on-device testing, which makes the real-world reliability of proposed schemes difficult to assess. We systematically reviewed 31 acoustic communication studies for commodity devices and found that none provided accessible source code. After contacting authors and re-implementing three promising schemes, we assembled a testbed of eight representative acoustic communication systems. Using over 11000 smartphone transmissions in both realistic indoor environments and an anechoic chamber, we provide a systematic and repeatable methodology for evaluating the reliability and generalizability of these schemes under real-world conditions. Our results show that many existing schemes face challenges in practical usage, largely due to severe multipath propagation indoors and varying audio characteristics across device models. To support future research and foster more robust evaluations, we release our re-implementations alongside the first comprehensive dataset of real-world acoustic transmissions. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of rigorous on-device testing and underscore the need for robust design strategies to bridge the gap between simulation results and reliable IoT deployments.

Authors: George Violettas, Lefteris Mamatas

TriCloudEdge is a scalable three-tier cloud continuum that integrates far-edge devices, intermediate edge nodes, and central cloud services, working in parallel as a unified solution. At the far edge, ultra-low-cost microcontrollers can handle lightweight AI tasks, while intermediate edge devices provide local intelligence, and the cloud tier offers large-scale analytics, federated learning, model adaptation, and global identity management. The proposed architecture enables multi-protocols and technologies (WebSocket, MQTT, HTTP) compared to a versatile protocol (Zenoh) to transfer diverse bidirectional data across the tiers, offering a balance between computational challenges and latency requirements. Comparative implementations between these two architectures demonstrate the trade-offs between resource utilization and communication efficiency. The results show that TriCloudEdge can distribute computational challenges to address latency and privacy concerns. The work also presents tests of AI model adaptation on the far edge and the computational effort challenges under the prism of parallelism. This work offers a perspective on the practical continuum challenges of implementation aligned with recent research advances addressing challenges across the different cloud levels.

### 4. [Conflict-Aware Client Selection for Multi-Server Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02458v1)

Authors: Mingwei Hong, Zheng Lin, Zehang Lin, Lin Li, Miao Yang, Xia Du, Zihan Fang, Zhaolu Kang, Dianxin Luan, Shunzhi Zhu

Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed machine learning (ML) that enables collaborative model training across clients without exposing raw data, thereby preserving user privacy and reducing communication costs. Despite these benefits, traditional single-server FL suffers from high communication latency due to the aggregation of models from a large number of clients. While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RL-CRP framework effectively reduces inter-server conflicts and significantly improves training efficiency in terms of convergence speed and communication cost.

### 5. [<SOG_k>: One LLM Token for Explicit Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01771v1)

Authors: Jingyao Wu, Bin Lu, Zijun Di, Xiaoying Gan, Meng Jin, Luoyi Fu, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou

Large language models show great potential in unstructured data understanding, but still face significant challenges with graphs due to their structural hallucination. Existing approaches mainly either verbalize graphs into natural language, which leads to excessive token consumption and scattered attention, or transform graphs into trainable continuous embeddings (i.e., soft prompt), but exhibit severe misalignment with original text tokens. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate one special token <SOG_k> to fully represent the Structure Of Graph within a unified token space, facilitating explicit topology input and structural information sharing. Specifically, we propose a topology-aware structural tokenizer that maps each graph topology into a highly selective single token. Afterwards, we construct a set of hybrid structure Question-Answering corpora to align new structural tokens with existing text tokens. With this approach, <SOG_k> empowers LLMs to understand, generate, and reason in a concise and accurate manner. Extensive experiments on five graph-level benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving a performance improvement of 9.9% to 41.4% compared to the baselines while exhibiting interpretability and consistency. Furthermore, our method provides a flexible extension to node-level tasks, enabling both global and local structural understanding. The codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/Jingyao-Wu/SOG.

### 6. [Federated Learning Meets Random Access: Energy-Efficient Uplink Resource Allocation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01913v1)

Authors: Giovanni Perin, Eunjeong Jeong, Nikolaos Pappas

Artificial intelligence-generated traffic is changing the shape of wireless networks. Specifically, as the amount of data generated to train machine learning models is massive, network resources must be carefully allocated to continue supporting standard applications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of allocating radio resources for two sets of concurrent devices communicating in uplink with a gateway over the same bandwidth. A set of devices performs federated learning (FL), and accesses the medium in FDMA, uploading periodically large models. The other set is throughput-oriented and accesses the medium via random access (RA), either with ALOHA or slotted-ALOHA protocols. We derive close-to-optimal solutions to the non-convex problem of minimizing the system energy consumption subject to FL latency and RA throughput constraints. Our solutions show that ALOHA can sustain high FL efficiency, yielding up to 48% lower consumption when the system is dominated by FL traffic. On the other hand, slotted-ALOHA becomes more efficient when RA traffic dominates, yielding 6% lower consumption.

### 1. [Multi-Agent Monte Carlo Tree Search for Makespan-Efficient Object Rearrangement in Cluttered Spaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02411v1)

Authors: Hanwen Ren, Junyong Kim, Aathman Tharmasanthiran, Ahmed H. Qureshi

Object rearrangement planning in complex, cluttered environments is a common challenge in warehouses, households, and rescue sites. Prior studies largely address monotone instances, whereas real-world tasks are often non-monotone-objects block one another and must be temporarily relocated to intermediate positions before reaching their final goals. In such settings, effective multi-agent collaboration can substantially reduce the time required to complete tasks. This paper introduces Centralized, Asynchronous, Multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (CAM-MCTS), a novel framework for general-purpose makespan-efficient object rearrangement planning in challenging environments. CAM-MCTS combines centralized task assignment-where agents remain aware of each other's intended actions to facilitate globally optimized planning-with an asynchronous task execution strategy that enables agents to take on new tasks at appropriate time steps, rather than waiting for others, guided by a one-step look-ahead cost estimate. This design minimizes idle time, prevents unnecessary synchronization delays, and enhances overall system efficiency. We evaluate CAM-MCTS across a diverse set of monotone and non-monotone tasks in cluttered environments, demonstrating consistent reductions in makespan compared to strong baselines. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world multi-agent system under different configurations, further confirming its effectiveness and robustness.

### 2. [Mapping-Guided Task Discovery and Allocation for Robotic Inspection of Underwater Structures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02389v1)

Authors: Marina Ruediger, Ashis G. Banerjee

Task generation for underwater multi-robot inspections without prior knowledge of existing geometry can be achieved and optimized through examination of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) data. By considering hardware parameters and environmental conditions, a set of tasks is generated from SLAM meshes and optimized through expected keypoint scores and distance-based pruning. In-water tests are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and determine the appropriate parameters. These results are compared to simulated Voronoi partitions and boustrophedon patterns for inspection coverage on a model of the test environment. The key benefits of the presented task discovery method include adaptability to unexpected geometry and distributions that maintain coverage while focusing on areas more likely to present defects or damage.

### 3. [Bandwidth-Efficient Multi-Agent Communication through Information Bottleneck and Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02035v1)

Authors: Ahmad Farooq, Kamran Iqbal

Multi-agent reinforcement learning systems deployed in real-world robotics applications face severe communication constraints that significantly impact coordination effectiveness. We present a framework that combines information bottleneck theory with vector quantization to enable selective, bandwidth-efficient communication in multi-agent environments. Our approach learns to compress and discretize communication messages while preserving task-critical information through principled information-theoretic optimization. We introduce a gated communication mechanism that dynamically determines when communication is necessary based on environmental context and agent states. Experimental evaluation on challenging coordination tasks demonstrates that our method achieves 181.8% performance improvement over no-communication baselines while reducing bandwidth usage by 41.4%. Comprehensive Pareto frontier analysis shows dominance across the entire success-bandwidth spectrum with area-under-curve of 0.198 vs 0.142 for next-best methods. Our approach significantly outperforms existing communication strategies and establishes a theoretically grounded framework for deploying multi-agent systems in bandwidth-constrained environments such as robotic swarms, autonomous vehicle fleets, and distributed sensor networks.

### 4. [A Unified Control Architecture for Macro-Micro Manipulation using a Active Remote Center of Compliance for Manufacturing Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01948v1)

Authors: Patrick Frank, Christian Friedrich

Macro-micro manipulators combine a macro manipulator with a large workspace, such as an industrial robot, with a lightweight, high-bandwidth micro manipulator. This enables highly dynamic interaction control while preserving the wide workspace of the robot. Traditionally, position control is assigned to the macro manipulator, while the micro manipulator handles the interaction with the environment, limiting the achievable interaction control bandwidth. To solve this, we propose a novel control architecture that incorporates the macro manipulator into the active interaction control. This leads to a increase in control bandwidth by a factor of 2.1 compared to the state of the art architecture, based on the leader-follower approach and factor 12.5 compared to traditional robot-based force control. Further we propose surrogate models for a more efficient controller design and easy adaptation to hardware changes. We validate our approach by comparing it against the other control schemes in different experiments, like collision with an object, following a force trajectory and industrial assembly tasks.

### 5. [Path Tracking with Dynamic Control Point Blending for Autonomous Vehicles: An Experimental Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01892v1)

Authors: Alexandre Lombard, Florent Perronnet, Nicolas Gaud, Abdeljalil Abbas-Turki

This paper presents an experimental study of a path-tracking framework for autonomous vehicles in which the lateral control command is applied to a dynamic control point along the wheelbase. Instead of enforcing a fixed reference at either the front or rear axle, the proposed method continuously interpolates between both, enabling smooth adaptation across driving contexts, including low-speed maneuvers and reverse motion. The lateral steering command is obtained by barycentric blending of two complementary controllers: a front-axle Stanley formulation and a rear-axle curvature-based geometric controller, yielding continuous transitions in steering behavior and improved tracking stability. In addition, we introduce a curvature-aware longitudinal control strategy based on virtual track borders and ray-tracing, which converts upcoming geometric constraints into a virtual obstacle distance and regulates speed accordingly. The complete approach is implemented in a unified control stack and validated in simulation and on a real autonomous vehicle equipped with GPS-RTK, radar, odometry, and IMU. The results in closed-loop tracking and backward maneuvers show improved trajectory accuracy, smoother steering profiles, and increased adaptability compared to fixed control-point baselines.

### 6. [DDP-WM: Disentangled Dynamics Prediction for Efficient World Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01780v1)

Authors: Shicheng Yin, Kaixuan Yin, Weixing Chen, Yang Liu, Guanbin Li, Liang Lin

World models are essential for autonomous robotic planning. However, the substantial computational overhead of existing dense Transformerbased models significantly hinders real-time deployment. To address this efficiency-performance bottleneck, we introduce DDP-WM, a novel world model centered on the principle of Disentangled Dynamics Prediction (DDP). We hypothesize that latent state evolution in observed scenes is heterogeneous and can be decomposed into sparse primary dynamics driven by physical interactions and secondary context-driven background updates. DDP-WM realizes this decomposition through an architecture that integrates efficient historical processing with dynamic localization to isolate primary dynamics. By employing a crossattention mechanism for background updates, the framework optimizes resource allocation and provides a smooth optimization landscape for planners. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDP-WM achieves significant efficiency and performance across diverse tasks, including navigation, precise tabletop manipulation, and complex deformable or multi-body interactions. Specifically, on the challenging Push-T task, DDP-WM achieves an approximately 9 times inference speedup and improves the MPC success rate from 90% to98% compared to state-of-the-art dense models. The results establish a promising path for developing efficient, high-fidelity world models. Codes will be available at https://github.com/HCPLabSYSU/DDP-WM.

### 7. [Uncertainty-Aware Non-Prehensile Manipulation with Mobile Manipulators under Object-Induced Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01731v1)

Authors: Jiwoo Hwang, Taegeun Yang, Jeil Jeong, Minsung Yoon, Sung-Eui Yoon

Non-prehensile manipulation using onboard sensing presents a fundamental challenge: the manipulated object occludes the sensor's field of view, creating occluded regions that can lead to collisions. We propose CURA-PPO, a reinforcement learning framework that addresses this challenge by explicitly modeling uncertainty under partial observability. By predicting collision possibility as a distribution, we extract both risk and uncertainty to guide the robot's actions. The uncertainty term encourages active perception, enabling simultaneous manipulation and information gathering to resolve occlusions. When combined with confidence maps that capture observation reliability, our approach enables safe navigation despite severe sensor occlusion. Extensive experiments across varying object sizes and obstacle configurations demonstrate that CURA-PPO achieves up to 3X higher success rates than the baselines, with learned behaviors that handle occlusions. Our method provides a practical solution for autonomous manipulation in cluttered environments using only onboard sensing.

### 8. [Real-Time Loop Closure Detection in Visual SLAM via NetVLAD and Faiss](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01673v1)

Authors: Enguang Fan

Loop closure detection (LCD) is a core component of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM): it identifies revisited places and enables pose-graph constraints that correct accumulated drift. Classic bag-of-words approaches such as DBoW are efficient but often degrade under appearance change and perceptual aliasing. In parallel, deep learning-based visual place recognition (VPR) descriptors (e.g., NetVLAD and Transformer-based models) offer stronger robustness, but their computational cost is often viewed as a barrier to real-time SLAM. In this paper, we empirically evaluate NetVLAD as an LCD module and compare it against DBoW on the KITTI dataset. We introduce a Fine-Grained Top-K precision-recall curve that better reflects LCD settings where a query may have zero or multiple valid matches. With Faiss-accelerated nearestneighbor search, NetVLAD achieves real-time query speed while improving accuracy and robustness over DBoW, making it a practical drop-in alternative for LCD in SLAM.

### 9. [From Perception to Action: Spatial AI Agents and World Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01644v1)

Authors: Gloria Felicia, Nolan Bryant, Handi Putra, Ayaan Gazali, Eliel Lobo, Esteban Rojas

While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence.

### 10. [A Closed-Form Geometric Retargeting Solver for Upper Body Humanoid Robot Teleoperation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01632v1)

Retargeting human motion to robot poses is a practical approach for teleoperating bimanual humanoid robot arms, but existing methods can be suboptimal and slow, often causing undesirable motion or latency. This is due to optimizing to match robot end-effector to human hand position and orientation, which can also limit the robot's workspace to that of the human. Instead, this paper reframes retargeting as an orientation alignment problem, enabling a closed-form, geometric solution algorithm with an optimality guarantee. The key idea is to align a robot arm to a human's upper and lower arm orientations, as identified from shoulder, elbow, and wrist (SEW) keypoints; hence, the method is called SEW-Mimic. The method has fast inference (3 kHz) on standard commercial CPUs, leaving computational overhead for downstream applications; an example in this paper is a safety filter to avoid bimanual self-collision. The method suits most 7-degree-of-freedom robot arms and humanoids, and is agnostic to input keypoint source. Experiments show that SEW-Mimic outperforms other retargeting methods in computation time and accuracy. A pilot user study suggests that the method improves teleoperation task success. Preliminary analysis indicates that data collected with SEW-Mimic improves policy learning due to being smoother. SEW-Mimic is also shown to be a drop-in way to accelerate full-body humanoid retargeting. Finally, hardware demonstrations illustrate SEW-Mimic's practicality. The results emphasize the utility of SEW-Mimic as a fundamental building block for bimanual robot manipulation and humanoid robot teleoperation.

We propose SWE-Universe, a scalable and efficient framework for automatically constructing real-world software engineering (SWE) verifiable environments from GitHub pull requests (PRs). To overcome the prevalent challenges of automatic building, such as low production yield, weak verifiers, and prohibitive cost, our framework utilizes a building agent powered by an efficient custom-trained model. This agent employs iterative self-verification and in-loop hacking detection to ensure the reliable generation of high-fidelity, verifiable tasks. Using this method, we scale the number of real-world multilingual SWE environments to a million scale (807,693). We demonstrate the profound value of our environments through large-scale agentic mid-training and reinforcement learning. Finally, we applied this technique to Qwen3-Max-Thinking and achieved a score of 75.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Our work provides both a critical resource and a robust methodology to advance the next generation of coding agents.

Authors: Zeping Li, Hongru Wang, Yiwen Zhao, Guanhua Chen, Yixia Li, Keyang Chen, Yixin Cao, Guangnan Ye, Hongfeng Chai, Mengdi Wang, Zhenfei Yin

Tool-using agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and multi-hop question answering. However, in long trajectories, agents often trigger excessive and low-quality tool calls, increasing latency and degrading inference performance, making managing tool-use behavior challenging. In this work, we conduct entropy-based pilot experiments and observe a strong positive correlation between entropy reduction and high-quality tool calls. Building on this finding, we propose using entropy reduction as a supervisory signal and design two reward strategies to address the differing needs of optimizing tool-use behavior. Sparse outcome rewards provide coarse, trajectory-level guidance to improve efficiency, while dense process rewards offer fine-grained supervision to enhance performance. Experiments across diverse domains show that both reward designs improve tool-use behavior: the former reduces tool calls by 72.07% compared to the average of baselines, while the latter improves performance by 22.27%. These results position entropy reduction as a key mechanism for enhancing tool-use behavior, enabling agents to be more adaptive in real-world applications.

Authors: Zhongyuan Lyu, Shuoyu Hu, Lujie Liu, Hongxia Yang, Ming LI

Automatically formulating optimization models from natural language descriptions is a growing focus in operations research, yet current LLM-based approaches struggle with the composite constraints and appropriate modeling paradigms required by complex operational rules. To address this, we introduce the Canonical Intermediate Representation (CIR): a schema that LLMs explicitly generate between problem descriptions and optimization models. CIR encodes the semantics of operational rules through constraint archetypes and candidate modeling paradigms, thereby decoupling rule logic from its mathematical instantiation. Upon a newly generated CIR knowledge base, we develop the rule-to-constraint (R2C) framework, a multi-agent pipeline that parses problem texts, synthesizes CIR implementations by retrieving domain knowledge, and instantiates optimization models. To systematically evaluate rule-to-constraint reasoning, we test R2C on our newly constructed benchmark featuring rich operational rules, and benchmarks from prior work. Extensive experiments show that R2C achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the proposed benchmark (47.2% Accuracy Rate). On established benchmarks from the literature, R2C delivers highly competitive results, approaching the performance of proprietary models (e.g., GPT-5). Moreover, with a reflection mechanism, R2C achieves further gains and sets new best-reported results on some benchmarks.

### 4. [Understanding and Detecting Flaky Builds in GitHub Actions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02307v1)

Authors: Wenhao Ge, Chen Zhang

Continuous Integration (CI) is widely used to provide rapid feedback on code changes; however, CI build outcomes are not always reliable. Builds may fail intermittently due to non-deterministic factors, leading to flaky builds that undermine developers' trust in CI, waste computational resources, and threaten the validity of CI-related empirical studies. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of flaky builds in GitHub Actions based on rerun data from 1,960 open-source Java projects. Our results show that 3.2% of builds are rerun, and 67.73% of these rerun builds exhibit flaky behavior, affecting 1,055 (51.28%) of the projects. Through an in-depth failure analysis, we identify 15 distinct categories of flaky failures, among which flaky tests, network issues, and dependency resolution issues are the most prevalent. Building on these findings, we propose a machine learning-based approach for detecting flaky failures at the job level. Compared with a state-of-the-art baseline, our approach improves the F1-score by up to 20.3%.

Authors: Zeming Wei, Zhixin Zhang, Chengcan Wu, Yihao Zhang, Xiaokun Luan, Meng Sun

Recent advancements in LLMs have led to significant breakthroughs in various AI applications. However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI.

Authors: Jon Škerlj, Seongjin Bien, Abdeldjallil Naceri, Sami Haddadin

We present $multipanda\_ros2$, a novel open-source ROS2 architecture for multi-robot control of Franka Robotics robots. Leveraging ros2 control, this framework provides native ROS2 interfaces for controlling any number of robots from a single process. Our core contributions address key challenges in real-time torque control, including interaction control and robot-environment modeling. A central focus of this work is sustaining a 1kHz control frequency, a necessity for real-time control and a minimum frequency required by safety standards. Moreover, we introduce a controllet-feature design pattern that enables controller-switching delays of $\le 2$ ms, facilitating reproducible benchmarking and complex multi-robot interaction scenarios. To bridge the simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap, we integrate a high-fidelity MuJoCo simulation with quantitative metrics for both kinematic accuracy and dynamic consistency (torques, forces, and control errors). Furthermore, we demonstrate that real-world inertial parameter identification can significantly improve force and torque accuracy, providing a methodology for iterative physics refinement. Our work extends approaches from soft robotics to rigid dual-arm, contact-rich tasks, showcasing a promising method to reduce the sim2real gap and providing a robust, reproducible platform for advanced robotics research.

### 7. [Agent-Based Software Artifact Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02235v1)

Authors: Zhaonan Wu, Yanjie Zhao, Zhenpeng Chen, Zheng Wang, Haoyu Wang

Artifact evaluation has been adopted in the Software Engineering (SE) research community for 15 years, substantially improving research reproducibility across major SE conferences. However, this success has introduced a growing scalability challenge, as artifact evaluation relies heavily on reviewers' manual execution and debugging, leading to escalating human effort amid rapidly increasing paper submissions. To address this problem, we investigate automated artifact evaluation. We first conduct a preliminary study on artifacts from top-tier SE conferences and identify three key challenges: perceiving execution states, maintaining stable execution environments, and recovering from execution errors. Inspired by these findings, we propose ArtifactCopilot, the first end-to-end agent-based framework for automated artifact evaluation. ArtifactCopilot automates environment construction, instruction execution, and error recovery by combining an execution normalization strategy to ensure environment stability with an artifact evaluation graph that transforms README documents into dependency-aware command graphs, enabling structured execution planning, execution-state tracking, and error recovery. Evaluation on 48 real-world artifacts shows that ArtifactCopilot matches human artifact evaluation outcomes for 85.42% of the artifacts, outperforming Claude Code by 52.09 percentage points, while costing only \$0.091 per artifact on average and requiring zero human intervention for 45 out of 48 artifacts.

### 8. [A Task-Level Evaluation of AI Agents in Open-Source Projects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02345v1)

Authors: Shojibur Rahman, Md Fazle Rabbi, Minhaz Zibran

In this paper, we present a comparative study of five autonomous coding agents using AIDev-pop, which is a public dataset containing thousands of AI-generated pull requests (PRs) across popular open-source repositories. We evaluate agents' performance along three task-aware dimensions spanning the PR lifecycle: (1) PR acceptance rate, (2) review discussion volume, and (3) commit message quality. Our quantitative analysis finds that Codex consistently achieves high PR acceptance rates across most task categories, while Copilot's PRs trigger the highest volume of both human and automated review discussions. In contrast, commit-level quality varies independently of acceptance outcomes. Claude and Cursor produce higher proportions of high-quality commit messages across several task types, and Codex exhibiting comparatively lower commit quality despite strong integration outcomes. Our findings inform selection and improvements of AI agents for their effective integration to collaborative software engineering.

### 9. [Role of CI Adoption in Mobile App Success: An Empirical Study of Open-Source Android Projects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01957v1)

Authors: Xiaoxin Zhou, Taher A. Ghaleb, Safwat Hassan

Mobile apps face strong pressure for fast and reliable updates. Continuous Integration (CI) helps automate builds, tests, and releases, but its impact on mobile development remains underexplored. Despite the widespread use of CI, little is known about how it affects development activity, release speed, and user-facing outcomes in mobile projects. Existing studies mostly focus on CI adoption in general-purpose software, providing limited insight into mobile-specific dynamics, such as app store visibility and user engagement. In this paper, we analyze open-source Android apps to (1) compare CI adopters and non-adopters, (2) characterize adoption patterns using activity and bug metrics, and (3) assess pre/post adoption changes and user-facing outcomes. We observe that CI adopters are larger and more active, with faster and more regular releases. CI adoption is concentrated in integration- and reliability-intensive categories (e.g., finance and productivity) and is associated with higher Google Play Store engagement (more downloads and reviews) without lower ratings. Overall, CI adoption aligns with practices that support sustained delivery, higher project visibility, and stronger user engagement in mobile ecosystems.

### 10. [AdNanny: One Reasoning LLM for All Offline Ads Recommendation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01563v1)

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in Natural Language Understanding and Generation, but deploying them directly in online advertising systems is often impractical due to strict millisecond-level latency constraints. This has motivated the use of LLMs offline to improve retrieval, ranking, and recommendation models. Existing solutions typically fine-tune separate LLMs for individual tasks such as query-ad relevance labeling, keyword-based query generation, and user profiling. This results in redundant models, high maintenance cost, and limited performance gains despite substantial overlap in domain knowledge and reasoning patterns. We introduce AdNanny, a unified reasoning-centric LLM that serves as a shared backbone for offline advertising tasks. AdNanny is obtained by fine-tuning a public 671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1 checkpoint using a scalable training system that supports hybrid dense-MoE parallelism. We construct reasoning-augmented corpora that pair structured supervision with step-by-step natural language explanations. A multi-task supervised fine-tuning stage with adaptive reweighting enables AdNanny to handle diverse labeling and generation tasks in a consistent reasoning format. This is followed by reinforcement learning using downstream advertising metrics to align model behavior with online retrieval and ranking objectives. AdNanny is deployed in production within Bing Ads, where it significantly reduces manual labeling effort and improves accuracy across multiple offline tasks. By consolidating many task-specific models into a single reasoning-centric foundation model, AdNanny provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale advertising systems.

Real-world social networks have structural inequalities, including the majority and minorities, and fairness-agnostic centrality measures often amplify these inequalities by disproportionately favoring majority nodes. Fairness-Sensitive PageRank aims to balance algorithmic influence across structurally and demographically diverse groups while preserving the link-based relevance of classical PageRank. However, existing formulations require solving constrained matrix inversions that scale poorly with network size. In this work, we develop an efficient mean-field approximation for Fairness-Sensitive PageRank (FSPR) that enforces group-level fairness through an estimated teleportation (jump) vector, thereby avoiding the costly matrix inversion and iterative optimization. We derive a closed-form approximation of FSPR using the in-degree and group label of nodes, along with the global group proportion. We further analyze intra-class fluctuations by deriving expressions for the variance of approximated FSPR scores. Empirical results on real-world networks demonstrate that the proposed approximation efficiently estimates the FSPR while reducing runtime by an order of magnitude, enabling fairness-constrained ranking at scale.

### 2. [The Verification Crisis: Expert Perceptions of GenAI Disinformation and the Case for Reproducible Provenance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02100v1)

Authors: Alexander Loth, Martin Kappes, Marc-Oliver Pahl

The growth of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has shifted disinformation production from manual fabrication to automated, large-scale manipulation. This article presents findings from the first wave of a longitudinal expert perception survey (N=21) involving AI researchers, policymakers, and disinformation specialists. It examines the perceived severity of multimodal threats -- text, image, audio, and video -- and evaluates current mitigation strategies.
  Results indicate that while deepfake video presents immediate "shock" value, large-scale text generation poses a systemic risk of "epistemic fragmentation" and "synthetic consensus," particularly in the political domain. The survey reveals skepticism about technical detection tools, with experts favoring provenance standards and regulatory frameworks despite implementation barriers.
  GenAI disinformation research requires reproducible methods. The current challenge is measurement: without standardized benchmarks and reproducibility checklists, tracking or countering synthetic media remains difficult. We propose treating information integrity as an infrastructure with rigor in data provenance and methodological reproducibility.

### 3. [DREAMS: A Social Exchange Theory-Informed Modeling of Misinformation Engagement on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01567v1)

Authors: Lin Tian, Marian-Andrei Rizoiu

Social media engagement prediction is a central challenge in computational social science, particularly for understanding how users interact with misinformation. Existing approaches often treat engagement as a homogeneous time-series signal, overlooking the heterogeneous social mechanisms and platform designs that shape how misinformation spreads. In this work, we ask: ``Can neural architectures discover social exchange principles from behavioral data alone?'' We introduce \textsc{Dreams} (\underline{D}isentangled \underline{R}epresentations and \underline{E}pisodic \underline{A}daptive \underline{M}odeling for \underline{S}ocial media misinformation engagements), a social exchange theory-guided framework that models misinformation engagement as a dynamic process of social exchange. Rather than treating engagement as a static outcome, \textsc{Dreams} models it as a sequence-to-sequence adaptation problem, where each action reflects an evolving negotiation between user effort and social reward conditioned by platform context. It integrates adaptive mechanisms to learn how emotional and contextual signals propagate through time and across platforms. On a cross-platform dataset spanning $7$ platforms and 2.37M posts collected between 2021 and 2025, \textsc{Dreams} achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting misinformation engagements, reaching a mean absolute percentage error of $19.25$\%. This is a $43.6$\% improvement over the strongest baseline. Beyond predictive gains, the model reveals consistent cross-platform patterns that align with social exchange principles, suggesting that integrating behavioral theory can enhance empirical modeling of online misinformation engagement.

### 4. [Cross-Domain Fake News Detection on Unseen Domains via LLM-Based Domain-Aware User Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01726v1)

Authors: Xuankai Yang, Yan Wang, Jiajie Zhu, Pengfei Ding, Hongyang Liu, Xiuzhen Zhang, Huan Liu

Cross-domain fake news detection (CD-FND) transfers knowledge from a source domain to a target domain and is crucial for real-world fake news mitigation. This task becomes particularly important yet more challenging when the target domain is previously unseen (e.g., the COVID-19 outbreak or the Russia-Ukraine war). However, existing CD-FND methods overlook such scenarios and consequently suffer from the following two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of high-level semantics in news and user engagements; and (2) scarcity of labeled data in unseen domains. Targeting these limitations, we find that large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for CD-FND on unseen domains, yet their effective use remains non-trivial. Nevertheless, two key challenges arise: (1) how to capture high-level semantics from both news content and user engagements using LLMs; and (2) how to make LLM-generated features more reliable and transferable for CD-FND on unseen domains. To tackle these challenges, we propose DAUD, a novel LLM-Based Domain-Aware framework for fake news detection on Unseen Domains. DAUD employs LLMs to extract high-level semantics from news content. It models users' single- and cross-domain engagements to generate domain-aware behavioral representations. In addition, DAUD captures the relations between original data-driven features and LLM-derived features of news, users, and user engagements. This allows it to extract more reliable domain-shared representations that improve knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DAUD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both general and unseen-domain CD-FND settings.

### 5. [Twinning Complex Networked Systems: Data-Driven Calibration of the mABCD Synthetic Graph Generator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02044v1)

Authors: Piotr Bródka, Michał Czuba, Bogumił Kamiński, Łukasz Kraiński, Katarzyna Musial, Paweł Prałat, Mateusz Stolarski

The increasing availability of relational data has contributed to a growing reliance on network-based representations of complex systems. Over time, these models have evolved to capture more nuanced properties, such as the heterogeneity of relationships, leading to the concept of multilayer networks. However, the analysis and evaluation of methods for these structures is often hindered by the limited availability of large-scale empirical data. As a result, graph generators are commonly used as a workaround, albeit at the cost of introducing systematic biases. In this paper, we address the inverse-generator problem by inferring the configuration parameters of a multilayer network generator, mABCD, from a real-world system. Our goal is to identify parameter settings that enable the generator to produce synthetic networks that act as digital twins of the original structure. We propose a method for estimating matching configurations and for quantifying the associated error. Our results demonstrate that this task is non-trivial, as strong interdependencies between configuration parameters weaken independent estimation and instead favour a joint-prediction approach.

### 1. [Training-free score-based diffusion for parameter-dependent stochastic dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02113v1)

Authors: Minglei Yang, Sicheng He

Simulating parameter-dependent stochastic differential equations (SDEs) presents significant computational challenges, as separate high-fidelity simulations are typically required for each parameter value of interest. Despite the success of machine learning methods in learning SDE dynamics, existing approaches either require expensive neural network training for score function estimation or lack the ability to handle continuous parameter dependence. We present a training-free conditional diffusion model framework for learning stochastic flow maps of parameter-dependent SDEs, where both drift and diffusion coefficients depend on physical parameters. The key technical innovation is a joint kernel-weighted Monte Carlo estimator that approximates the conditional score function using trajectory data sampled at discrete parameter values, enabling interpolation across both state space and the continuous parameter domain. Once trained, the resulting generative model produces sample trajectories for any parameter value within the training range without retraining, significantly accelerating parameter studies, uncertainty quantification, and real-time filtering applications. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three numerical examples of increasing complexity, showing accurate approximation of conditional distributions across varying parameter values.

### 2. [Efficient Swap Regret Minimization in Combinatorial Bandits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02087v1)

Authors: Andreas Kontogiannis, Vasilis Pollatos, Panayotis Mertikopoulos, Ioannis Panageas

This paper addresses the problem of designing efficient no-swap regret algorithms for combinatorial bandits, where the number of actions $N$ is exponentially large in the dimensionality of the problem. In this setting, designing efficient no-swap regret translates to sublinear -- in horizon $T$ -- swap regret with polylogarithmic dependence on $N$. In contrast to the weaker notion of external regret minimization - a problem which is fairly well understood in the literature - achieving no-swap regret with a polylogarithmic dependence on $N$ has remained elusive in combinatorial bandits. Our paper resolves this challenge, by introducing a no-swap-regret learning algorithm with regret that scales polylogarithmically in $N$ and is tight for the class of combinatorial bandits. To ground our results, we also demonstrate how to implement the proposed algorithm efficiently -- that is, with a per-iteration complexity that also scales polylogarithmically in $N$ -- across a wide range of well-studied applications.

### 3. [New explanations and inference for least angle regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02491v1)

Authors: Karl B. Gregory, Daniel J. Nordman

Efron et al. (2004) introduced least angle regression (LAR) as an algorithm for linear predictions, intended as an alternative to forward selection with connections to penalized regression. However, LAR has remained somewhat of a "black box," where some basic behavioral properties of LAR output are not well understood, including an appropriate termination point for the algorithm. We provide a novel framework for inference with LAR, which also allows LAR to be understood from new perspectives with several newly developed mathematical properties. The LAR algorithm at a data level can viewed as estimating a population counterpart "path" that organizes a response mean along regressor variables which are ordered according to a decreasing series of population "correlation" parameters; such parameters are shown to have meaningful interpretations for explaining variable contributions whereby zero correlations denote unimportant variables. In the output of LAR, estimates of all non-zero population correlations turn out to have independent normal distributions for use in inference, while estimates of zero-valued population correlations have a certain non-normal joint distribution. These properties help to provide a formal rule for stopping the LAR algorithm. While the standard bootstrap for regression can fail for LAR, a modified bootstrap provides a practical and formally justified tool for interpreting the entrance of variables and quantifying uncertainty in estimation. The LAR inference method is studied through simulation and illustrated with data examples.

### 4. [Ultrafast On-chip Online Learning via Spline Locality in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02056v1)

Authors: Duc Hoang, Aarush Gupta, Philip Harris

Ultrafast online learning is essential for high-frequency systems, such as controls for quantum computing and nuclear fusion, where adaptation must occur on sub-microsecond timescales. Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate model-free online learning at sub-microsecond latencies.

### 5. [Data- and Variance-dependent Regret Bounds for Online Tabular MDPs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01903v1)

Authors: Mingyi Li, Taira Tsuchiya, Kenji Yamanishi

This work studies online episodic tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) with known transitions and develops best-of-both-worlds algorithms that achieve refined data-dependent regret bounds in the adversarial regime and variance-dependent regret bounds in the stochastic regime. We quantify MDP complexity using a first-order quantity and several new data-dependent measures for the adversarial regime, including a second-order quantity and a path-length measure, as well as variance-based measures for the stochastic regime. To adapt to these measures, we develop algorithms based on global optimization and policy optimization, both built on optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with log-barrier regularization. For global optimization, our algorithms achieve first-order, second-order, and path-length regret bounds in the adversarial regime, and in the stochastic regime, they achieve a variance-aware gap-independent bound and a variance-aware gap-dependent bound that is polylogarithmic in the number of episodes. For policy optimization, our algorithms achieve the same data- and variance-dependent adaptivity, up to a factor of the episode horizon, by exploiting a new optimistic $Q$-function estimator. Finally, we establish regret lower bounds in terms of data-dependent complexity measures for the adversarial regime and a variance measure for the stochastic regime, implying that the regret upper bounds achieved by the global-optimization approach are nearly optimal.

### 6. [The Effect of Mini-Batch Noise on the Implicit Bias of Adam](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01642v1)

Authors: Matias D. Cattaneo, Boris Shigida

With limited high-quality data and growing compute, multi-epoch training is gaining back its importance across sub-areas of deep learning. Adam(W), versions of which are go-to optimizers for many tasks such as next token prediction, has two momentum hyperparameters $(β_1, β_2)$ controlling memory and one very important hyperparameter, batch size, controlling (in particular) the amount mini-batch noise. We introduce a theoretical framework to understand how mini-batch noise influences the implicit bias of memory in Adam (depending on $β_1$, $β_2$) towards sharper or flatter regions of the loss landscape, which is commonly observed to correlate with the generalization gap in multi-epoch training. We find that in the case of large batch sizes, higher $β_2$ increases the magnitude of anti-regularization by memory (hurting generalization), but as the batch size becomes smaller, the dependence of (anti-)regulariation on $β_2$ is reversed. A similar monotonicity shift (in the opposite direction) happens in $β_1$. In particular, the commonly "default" pair $(β_1, β_2) = (0.9, 0.999)$ is a good choice if batches are small; for larger batches, in many settings moving $β_1$ closer to $β_2$ is much better in terms of validation accuracy in multi-epoch training. Moreover, our theoretical derivations connect the scale of the batch size at which the shift happens to the scale of the critical batch size. We illustrate this effect in experiments with small-scale data in the about-to-overfit regime.

### 7. [Learning Beyond the Gaussian Data: Learning Dynamics of Neural Networks on an Expressive and Cumulant-Controllable Data Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.02153v1)

Authors: Onat Ure, Samet Demir, Zafer Dogan

We study the effect of high-order statistics of data on the learning dynamics of neural networks (NNs) by using a moment-controllable non-Gaussian data model. Considering the expressivity of two-layer neural networks, we first construct the data model as a generative two-layer NN where the activation function is expanded by using Hermite polynomials. This allows us to achieve interpretable control over high-order cumulants such as skewness and kurtosis through the Hermite coefficients while keeping the data model realistic. Using samples generated from the data model, we perform controlled online learning experiments with a two-layer NN. Our results reveal a moment-wise progression in training: networks first capture low-order statistics such as mean and covariance, and progressively learn high-order cumulants. Finally, we pretrain the generative model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset and leverage the generated samples for further experiments. The results of these additional experiments confirm our conclusions and show the utility of the data model in a real-world scenario. Overall, our proposed approach bridges simplified data assumptions and practical data complexity, which offers a principled framework for investigating distributional effects in machine learning and signal processing.

### 8. [Observation-dependent Bayesian active learning via input-warped Gaussian processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01898v1)

Authors: Sanna Jarl, Maria Bånkestad, Jonathan J. S. Scragg, Jens Sjölund

Bayesian active learning relies on the precise quantification of predictive uncertainty to explore unknown function landscapes. While Gaussian process surrogates are the standard for such tasks, an underappreciated fact is that their posterior variance depends on the observed outputs only through the hyperparameters, rendering exploration largely insensitive to the actual measurements. We propose to inject observation-dependent feedback by warping the input space with a learned, monotone reparameterization. This mechanism allows the design policy to expand or compress regions of the input space in response to observed variability, thereby shaping the behavior of variance-based acquisition functions. We demonstrate that while such warps can be trained via marginal likelihood, a novel self-supervised objective yields substantially better performance. Our approach improves sample efficiency across a range of active learning benchmarks, particularly in regimes where non-stationarity challenges traditional methods.

### 9. [Universal Redundancies in Time Series Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01605v1)

Authors: Anthony Bao, Venkata Hasith Vattikuti, Jeffrey Lai, William Gilpin

Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) leverage extensive pretraining to accurately predict unseen time series during inference, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Through large-scale evaluations on standard benchmarks, we find that leading transformer-based TSFMs exhibit redundant components in their intermediate layers. We introduce a set of tools for mechanistic interpretability of TSFMs, including ablations of specific components and direct logit attribution on the residual stream. Our findings are consistent across several leading TSFMs with diverse architectures, and across a diverse set of real-world and synthetic time-series datasets. We discover that all models in our study are robust to ablations of entire layers. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework framing transformers as kernel regressors, motivating a purely intrinsic strategy for ablating heads based on the stable rank of the per-head projection matrices. Using this approach, we uncover the specific heads responsible for degenerate phenomena widely observed in TSFMs, such as parroting of motifs from the context and seasonality bias. Our study sheds light on the universal properties of this emerging class of architectures for continuous-time sequence modeling.

### 10. [Inference-Aware Meta-Alignment of LLMs via Non-Linear GRPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.01603v1)

Authors: Shokichi Takakura, Akifumi Wachi, Rei Higuchi, Kohei Miyaguchi, Taiji Suzuki

Aligning large language models (LLMs) to diverse human preferences is fundamentally challenging since criteria can often conflict with each other. Inference-time alignment methods have recently gained popularity as they allow LLMs to be aligned to multiple criteria via different alignment algorithms at inference time. However, inference-time alignment is computationally expensive since it often requires multiple forward passes of the base model. In this work, we propose inference-aware meta-alignment (IAMA), a novel approach that enables LLMs to be aligned to multiple criteria with limited computational budget at inference time. IAMA trains a base model such that it can be effectively aligned to multiple tasks via different inference-time alignment algorithms. To solve the non-linear optimization problems involved in IAMA, we propose non-linear GRPO, which provably converges to the optimal solution in the space of probability measures.
